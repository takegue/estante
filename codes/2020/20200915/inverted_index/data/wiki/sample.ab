4 femaleweight = 25to45lbkg abbr=on maleheight = The Lacy Dog or Blue Lacy Dog is a breed of working dog that originated in Texas in the mid-19th century . The Lacy was first recognized in 2001 by the Texas Senate . In Senate Resolution No. 436 , the 77th Legislature honored the Lacy as a true Texas breed . In June 2005 , Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation adopting the blue Lacy as the official State Dog Breed of Texas . As expected , the vast majority of Lacy dogs are found in Texas . However , as the breed becomes more well recognized , there are breeding populations being established across the United States , and in Canada . # Description # # Appearance # Lacy dogs are strong and fast , lightly built but proportional within the height-to-weight ratio . Height at the withers is from 17to22incm disp=flip . Dependent on height and general conditioning , weight should be approximately 25to45lbkg disp=flip for females and 35to55lbkg disp=flip for males . The standards listed in the Texas House Concurrent Resolution No. 108 are slightly different : height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not until 2005 that it was official . # Color # Though they are often called blue Lacys , there are three permissible color varieties of the Lacy . Blues are any shade of gray from light silver to dark charcoal . Reds range from light cream to rust . The Tri combines a blue base with distinct red markings as appropriate for trim , and white which may appear on the brisket and stretch from chin to groin . White may also be present on one or more paws . Excessive white is discouraged , and markings on the face or above mid-line are a disqualifying fault . Their eyes are sharp and alert , ranging in color from bright yellow to rich amber . # Coat # The coat should be short , smooth and tight . An excessively long or rough coat is a disqualification . Lacys shed , but require minimal grooming. # Temperament # Dogs in general are intelligent , intense , active , and alert . Developed to be both hunting and herding dogs , they display great drive and determination to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have too much energy and drive for small children . They are easy to train , learning new skills quickly . # Activities # The Lacy is a working breed , and does much better when given a job , which allows them to burn off excessive energy . Work they excel at includes herding livestock , blood trailing or tracking , treeing game , running trap lines , and hunting wild hogs . Modern activities like agility that stress intelligence , passion , speed and nimbleness may be appropriate substitutes for traditional work . Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests . Lacys generally exhibit herding instincts , and can be trained to compete in stock dog trials , or hog bays .

4 birthplace=Milwaukee , Wisconsin deathplace=Washington , D.C. Leslie Les Aspin , Jr . ( July 21 , 1938 May 21 , 1995 ) was a United States Representative from 1971 to 1993 , and the United States Secretary of Defense under President Bill Clinton from January 21 , 1993 to February 3 , 1994 . In Congress , Aspin had a reputation as an intellectual who took a middle-of-the-road position on controversial issues . He supported the Reagan administration regarding the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras , but he opposed the B-2 bomber and the Strategic Defense Initiative . He played a major role in convincing the House to support the January 1991 resolution supporting the use of force by President G.H.W. Bush against Iraq , after it invaded Kuwait . As Secretary of Defense , he faced complex social issues , such as the roles of homosexuals in uniform , and of women in combat . He faced major decisions regarding the use of military force in Somalia , Bosnia , and Haiti . He proposed budget cuts and restructuring of forces as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold War . The loss of American lives in Somalia because of inadequate military support led to his resignation . # Early life # Aspin was born in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . He graduated from Shorewood High School . He attended Yale University , where he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity , and graduated ' ' summa cum laude ' ' in 1960 with a Bachelor of Arts in history . In 1962 , Aspin received his Master of Arts in economics from Oxford University , where he was a Rhodes Scholar , and his Ph.D in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966 . As an officer in the U.S. Army from 1966 to 1968 , he served as a systems analyst in the Pentagon under Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara , serving in the Office of Systems Analysis . Before his election as a Democrat to Congress in 1970 , Aspin had been active in Wisconsin politics and had taught economics at Marquette University . # U.S. Congress # Aspin ran as a peace candidate in 1970 , opposing the Vietnam War . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was endorsed by the party . After losing the initial count by a few dozen votes , he demanded a recount and won the primary , by a few dozen votes . In the general election he defeated the incumbent , Henry Schadeberg . Aspin was elected as a Democrat to the 92nd and to the 11 succeeding Congresses and served from January 3 , 1971 , until his resignation January 20 , 1993 . Aspin began his career in the United States House of Representatives as an outsider but soon developed a particular interest and expertise in defense matters . Before and during his tenure in the House , he had opposed the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War . In his early years in Congress , he often issued press releases critical of shortcomings he detected in the armed forces . In 1973 , he criticized the Air Force for devising a plan to purchase 200 beagle puppies , tie the dogs ' vocal cords , and conduct tests of poisonous gases . After Aspin began a publicity campaign against the Air Force 's plan , an outraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department , surpassing the amount ever sent about any other subject . In March 1974 , Aspin told an audience at Brown University , including future 4-star General Wesley Clark and four West Point cadets : You , the young officer and cadets sitting there - never in your lifetimes will you see us intervene abroad . We 've learned that lesson . By 1985 , when Aspin became chairman of the Armed Services Committee , he was recognized as a leading defense authority . His chairmanship caused controversy among some House Democrats , particularly because he supported the Reagan administration 's policies on the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras . Although temporarily removed from his committee chair by his Democratic colleagues in January 1987 , Aspin weathered the crisis and regained the chairmanship three weeks later . He again broke with many Democrats in January 1991 when he issued a paper supporting the Bush administration 's intention to use military force to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait . The accuracy of his prediction that the United States could win a quick military victory with light casualties added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Defense # # Nomination and confirmation # Aspin served as an adviser to Clinton on defense matters during the 1992 presidential campaign . Given Clinton 's lack of military experience , appointment of a prominent and respected defense expert to head The Pentagon seemed desirable . Because of his leadership position in the House , Aspin 's views on defense issues were well known . He was skeptical about the Strategic Defense Initiative , and favored a smaller Navy , a cut in U.S. troops in Europe , and further reduction of military personnel strength . These positions , along with the assumption that Aspin would work toward a substantial cut in the Defense budget , worried the military . Defense industry leaders applauded Aspin 's selection because he favored maintaining a viable defense industrial base . Although questioned extensively , Aspin won easy confirmation in the Senate . # Agenda and early difficulties # Shortly after he took office , Aspin discussed dangers that had emerged with the end of the Cold War : the uncertainty that reform could succeed in the former Soviet Union ; the enhanced possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the likely proliferation of regional conflicts ; and the failure to take adequate account of the impact of the state of the domestic economy on U.S. national security interests . Given these conditions and the end of the Cold War , it seemed clear that the Pentagon was entering a period of potentially profound change . Aspin looked like a sound choice to manage this change . As it turned out , Aspin faced difficulties from the beginning . A serious heart ailment put him in the hospital for several days in February 1993 , after barely a month in office . A month later he was back in the hospital for implantation of a heart pacemaker . Even so , he had to deal immediately with the highly charged question of homosexuals in the military , a controversy left over from his predecessor Dick Cheney 's tenure . That had become an issue in the 1992 campaign , when Clinton had promised to end discrimination against homosexuals . During his confirmation hearings Aspin indicated that he would take action quickly , and on entering office he presented a plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joint Chiefs of Staff and presented a timetable leading to an order dealing with the matter . This plan provoked widespread protest from all sides on the issue . # Gender and sexuality in the military # The fallout from the controversy wounded both Clinton and Aspin politically and dragged on until December 1993 , when , after many months of equivocation , confusion , and more controversy , Aspin released new regulations , known as the Do n't ask , do n't tell policy on homosexual conduct in the armed forces : Applicants for the services would not be asked about their sexual orientation , and homosexual orientation would not disqualify anyone from service unless manifested by homosexual conduct ; military personnel would be judged on suitability for service , not sexual orientation ; separation from the service would be based on homosexual acts , same sex marriage , or statements by an individual that he or she was bisexual or homosexual , with the person accorded the opportunity to rebut the presumption of homosexual acts ; DoD criminal investigation or law enforcement organizations would not investigate solely to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions would not be included in personnel security questionnaires ; finally , service members would be informed of DoD policy on sexual conduct during their training . This compromise policy , issued after an agonizing and divisive public debate , did not completely satisfy any of the concerned parties . Also on the social side , Aspin had to deal with the volatile question of servicewomen in combat . In April 1993 he announced a revised policy on the assignment of women in the armed forces : The services were to allow women to compete for assignments in combat aircraft ; the Navy was to open additional ships to women and draft a proposal for Congress to remove existing legislative barriers to the assignment of women to combat vessels ; and the Army and Marine Corps were to look for opportunities for women to serve in such components as field artillery and air defense . ( This was a response to recommendations made by an ad hoc committee chaired by Barbara S. Pope appointed in the wake of the Tailhook scandal . ) Meanwhile , Secretary of the Air Force Sheila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense budget and bottom-up review # Development of the Defense budget for FY 1994 , beginning on 1 October 1993 , remained Aspin 's biggest task . The budget process proved more complicated than usual , owing to Clinton 's campaign pledge to reduce DoD funding and to a bottom-up review of the military structure ordered by Aspin shortly after he took office . The end of the Cold War and the consequent opportunity to cut military costs clearly called for the kind of reevaluation of ends and means that the bottom-up review might contribute . A Pentagon steering group chaired by Under Secretary of Defense ( Acquisition and Technology ) John M. Deutch and including representatives from various OSD offices , the Joint Staff , and the services conducted the review . Because of the growing threat of regional conflicts , Aspin wanted to have a strong capability to carry out limited military operations , including peacekeeping , and to maintain a strong peacetime presence of U.S. forces around the world . The bottom-up review report , which Aspin released in September 1993 , took into account strategy formulation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The report projected a reduced force structure still capable of fighting and winning two simultaneous major regional conflicts . Forces would include 10 active Army divisions ; 11 carrier battle groups , 45 to 55 attack submarines , and about 345 ships ; 5 active Marine brigades ; and 13 active and 7 reserve Air Force fighter wings . The report also called for additional prepositioned equipment and airlift/sealift capacity , improved anti-armor and precision-guided munitions , and enhanced Army National Guard combat brigade readiness . The conclusions of the bottom-up review influenced the development of the FY 1994 Defense budget , although detailed work on the budget had begun as soon as Aspin took office . In March 1993 Aspin introduced a FY 1994 budget proposal costing $263.4 billion , about $12 billion below current levels , and reflecting cuts in the military services similar to those later included in the bottom-up review . To some critics of high military spending , Aspin 's budget plan differed little from that of the Bush administration . In the fall of 1993 Aspin began to tell the White House that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review , would exceed the more than $1 trillion projected by the Clinton administration . In December 1993 he put the anticipated shortfall at no less than $50 billion , the consequence of inaccurate inflation estimates , a military pay raise , and failure to account for other Pentagon costs , including peacekeeping operations . The size of the force needed to meet the two regional wars scenario contributed to the projected budget shortfall . Furthermore , Aspin was on record as favoring the use of U.S. troops in regional conflicts , as opposed to other decisionmakers , including General Colin Powell , chairman of the JCS . Aspin 's departure from office early in 1994 left further decisions on the Defense budget to his successor . The final FY 1994 budget amounted to a little under $252 billion in total obligational authority . Like his predecessors Carlucci and Cheney , Aspin faced the perennial issue of base closures , which could also affect the Defense budget . In March 1993 he released a plan to close an additional 31 large military installations and to shrink or consolidate 134 other sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning in 2000 . A new Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission approved the proposal , which went into effect when Congress accepted it as a package . The SDI program also held important budget implications . In May 1993 Aspin announced the end of the Star Wars era , explaining that the collapse of the Soviet Union had determined the fate of SDI . He renamed the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization ( BMDO ) and established its priorities as theater and national missile defense and useful follow-on technologies . Aspin 's assignment of responsibility for BMDO to the under secretary of defense ( acquisition and technology ) signified the downgrading of the program . # Global crises and initiatives # While seeking solutions to the complex budget and force structure issues , Aspin found himself beset with difficult regional problems and conflicts that demanded decisions and action . In NATO he pushed the U.S.-sponsored Partnership for Peace program to bring together NATO members and nonmembers for military activities , including training maneuvers , equipment sharing , search and rescue , antiterrorist efforts , environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brussels in December 1993 the NATO defense ministers agreed to consider for future alliance membership those non-NATO nations that participated in the program . Russian President Boris Yeltsin warned that attempts to bring Eastern European nations into NATO would threaten his country 's strategic interests and endanger hopes for the former Soviet bloc 's reconciliation with the West . Yeltsin argued that enlarging NATO would reawaken old Russian concerns about encirclement and possibly weaken the cause of democratic reform . The unstable situation in Haiti , where elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide had been ousted from office by the military in September 1991 , presented another regional problem . The United States pressured the military government to restore Aristide . In July 1993 , the Haitian military regime agreed to reinstate Aristide by October 30 , 1993 , but then refused to step down . In October , in an effort Clinton approved even though Aspin opposed it , the United States sent the USS Harlan County carrying 200 troops to Port-au-Prince , Haiti 's capital . Met by a hostile mob of armed Haitians , the ship turned away without attempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort to professionalize the Haitian military and undertake civil assistance projects . Some observers attacked Aspin for not taking a harder stand in the administration against an action he opposed and then aborting the effort in the face of local opposition . During Aspin 's term the U.S. was concerned that Communist North Korea might have underway a nuclear weapons development program . This gave way to alarm when that country refused to allow full inspection of nuclear sites . In November 1993 North Korea demanded that the United States and South Korea cancel a planned joint training exercise as a precondition during discussions on the nuclear issue . Aspin rejected this demand and announced that the United States would suspend plans to withdraw its troops gradually from the peninsula . In the Persian Gulf area , Iraq remained a problem . In June 1993 two U.S. Navy ships fired Tomahawk missiles against the headquarters building of Iraq 's intelligence service in Baghdad in response to evidence of a plot to assassinate former President Bush during a visit to Kuwait . Aspin described the attack as a wake up call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report on the U.S. military performance during the 1991 Gulf War , the result of a study undertaken by the House Armed Services Committee when he chaired it . The report concluded that the U.S. Central Command had greatly exaggerated damage done to Iraqi military equipment , such as tanks and naval vessels , by air strikes . Aspin also had to consider the question of health problems of U.S. service personnel who participated in the action against Iraq . He announced that a preliminary review disclosed no connection between chemical weapon agents and the reported health problems . Nevertheless , he formed a panel of outside experts to examine the issue further . The worsening crisis in Bosnia commanded attention and demanded some kind of U.S. response . Aspin did not favor using ground forces to intervene in the civil war involving the Bosnian Muslims , Serbs , and Croats , but thought that the use of sophisticated weapons was a more reasonable option . Eventually the administration decided on an airdrop of humanitarian aid , even though Aspin did not favor the plan . Somalia turned out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clans had engulfed the country since 1991 . Direct U.S. involvement , begun in August 1992 , provided food through a military airlift and other means to the people of Somalia . In December 1992 , shortly before Aspin became secretary of defense , the United States joined a new Unified Task Force ( UNITAF ) to provide security as well as food relief . The United States sent 26,000 troops to Somalia to join about 13,000 others from more than 20 nations . UNITAF , operating until May 1993 , restored order in Somalia and distributed food widely . In May 1993 Operation Somalia-2 ( UNOSOM-2 ) began in an effort to create conditions to enable the Somalis to rebuild the country . The United States cut its troops in Somalia to some 4,000 and then added 400 Army Rangers in August 1993 . At that time , confronting criticism at home that the United States was getting more deeply involved in the factional violence in Somalia without a clear rationale , Aspin explained that U.S. troops would remain until order had been restored in Mogadishu , Somalia 's capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effective police forces were operating in the country 's major cities . At the same time the United States increased its military efforts against a leading Somali warlord , Mohamed Farrah Aidid . # Criticism and final days in office # In September , General Powell asked Aspin to approve the request of the U.S. commander in Somalia for tanks , armored vehicles and AC-130 Spectre gunships for his forces . Aspin turned down the request . Shortly thereafter Aidid 's forces in Mogadishu killed 18 U.S. soldiers and wounded more than 75 in attacks that also resulted in the shooting down of two U.S. helicopters and the capture of one pilot ( see the Battle of Mogadishu ) . In the face of severe congressional criticism , Aspin admitted that in view of what had happened he had made a mistake , but stated that the request for armored equipment had been made within the context of delivering humanitarian aid to Somalia rather than protecting troops . In an appearance before a congressional committee to answer questions about the Somalia disaster , Aspin made an unfavorable impression and appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his performance . The president publicly defended Aspin but made clear that the White House was not involved in the decision not to send armor reinforcements to Somalia . Several members of Congress called on Clinton to ask for Aspin 's resignation . On 15 December 1993 President Clinton announced Aspin 's resignation , for personal reasons . Given the problems that Aspin encountered during his short term , most obviously the losses in Mogadishu , observers assumed that the president had asked him to step down . Speculation in the media centered on the Somalia embarrassment and on Aspin 's differences with the Office of Management and Budget over how much the Defense budget should be cut . The secretary 's health problems may well have also been a factor . One news magazine stated that Aspin 's major handicap was neither his famously unmilitary bearing nor his inability to discipline himself or the enormous Pentagon bureaucracy ; it is his politician 's instinct for the middle ground on defense issues . Aspin continued to serve as secretary of defense until February 3 , 1994 , when William J. Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving his position , Aspin then joined the faculty of Marquette University 's international affairs program in Washington and was affiliated with the Washington-based think-tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies . In March he became a member of the Commission on Roles and Missions , and in May Clinton chose him to be chairman of the President 's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board . In March 1995 he began work as chairman of still another study group , this on the Roles and Capabilities of the Intelligence Community . Aspin had had increasing difficulty during the last years of his life with a congenital heart condition ( asymmetric septal hypertrophy ; hypertrophic/obstructive cardiomyopathy ) . It necessitated hospitalization during his tenure as Defense Secretary , with placement of a pacemaker . His cardiac disorder was complicated in May 1995 by a cerebrovascular accident ( stroke ) , which resulted in Dr. Aspin 's death on May 21 , 1995 in Washington , D.C .. He was interred at Brookfield 's Wisconsin Memorial Park cemetery . Marquette University named its Washington government center in Aspin 's honor .

Laury Silvers of Skidmore College , who read the manuscript , wrote at progressiveislam.org : # <p> Do n't miss the self-disgust . I have read the whole novel . It is extraordinary .

4 Consort Chen Farong ( ) was an imperial consort during the Chinese dynasty Liu Song . She was a concubine of Emperor Ming , and during his reign , she carried the rank of ' ' Zhaohua ' ' ( ) , the sixth highest rank for Liu Song imperial consorts . Consort Chen was from the Liu Song capital Jiankang , and she was regarded as the mother of Emperor Ming 's son Liu Zhun ( later Emperor Shun ) , born in 467 , but whether she was his biological mother is a matter of historical dispute . Historical accounts , written during the succeeding Southern Qi Dynasty , indicate that Emperor Ming was impotent , and that although he had 12 sons , those were the results of his having seized his brothers ' pregnant concubines and kept the children if they bore males , or his having had his concubines have sexual relations with others . ( However , the fact that his wife Empress Wang Zhenfeng had two daughters , although no sons , may argue against such allegations , because it appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childrenindeed , the allegations stated that he would only do this if his brothers ' concubines bore malesor that the morally upright Empress Wang would engage in sexual relations with others , thus suggesting that the allegations were made to delegitimize Emperor Ming 's sons Emperor Houfei and Emperor Shun vis--vis Southern Qi . ) Those same accounts indicate that Liu Zhun was actually the biological son of Emperor Ming 's brother Liu Xiufan ( ) the Prince of Guiyang and one of Liu Xiufan 's concubines , and that Emperor Ming had her raise Liu Zhun . Emperor Ming died in 472 , and was succeeded by his son Liu Yu ( Emperor Houfei ) . Because Liu Zhun , as the emperor 's brother , carried the title of Prince of Ancheng , Consort Chen was honored as the Princess Dowager of Ancheng . After the impulsive and violent Emperor Houfei was assassinated in 477 , the general Xiao Daocheng effectively took over the government and made Liu Zhun a puppet emperor . Consort Chen , as the emperor 's mother , was honored as Consort Dowager ( ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife Empress Wang . Xiao forced Emperor Shun to yield the throne to him in 479 , ending Liu Song and starting Southern Qi , and Emperor Shun was created the Prince of Ruyin . Accordingly , Consort Chen became known as the Princess Dowager of Ruyin . Later that year , the former Emperor Shun was killed by soldiers who were supposed to protect him , and Xiao then ordered a general killing of the Liu clan . It appeared unlikely that Consort Chen would have been killed in the slaughter , although it is not known when she died .

4 coordinates = North Medford High School is a public high school in Medford , Oregon , United States . It is part of Medford School District ( Oregon ) # History # Originally the City of Medford had a single high school , called Medford High School , constructed in the 1920s . In the 1960s , the school district expanded , constructing a new high school on the opposite side of the city . Rather than develop this into an independent school , the district kept Medford High School as the lone school , with students attending at the two different locations . The current campus of NMHS was the newly constructed Medford Senior High School , with grades 11 and 12 attending while grades 9 and 10 went to Medford Mid High School , which later became South Medford High School ( SMHS ) and ultimately Central Medford High School . ( SMHS has since changed locations following construction of a new school ) . This was set in place to primarily to allow Medford to compete athletically with larger school districts such as Portland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic ( then 2A ) divisions if the district would have been divided into two secondary schools .

Both now house around 2,000 students , similar to the number of students Medford High School collectively held in the 1970s and 1980s. # Campus development # North Medford was built in 1967 and has been remodeled and has had additions added starting in 1973 through 1981 and again in 1992 .

2514 WMD conjecture in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq concerns the failure by the United Nations Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission ( UNMOVIC ) and the U.S.-led Iraq Survey Group ( ISG ) to locate undeclared stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction both before and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq . The United States effectively terminated the search effort for unconventional weaponry in January 2005 , and the Iraq Intelligence Commission concluded that the judgements of the U.S. intelligence community about the continued existence of weapons of mass destruction and an associated military program were wrong . Other investigative bodies continue to examine material evidence relating to past programs . Major controversy was generated when prohibited weapons were not found . Some observers reason Saddam Hussein miscalculated by deceiving Intelligence services into believing he had retained active stockpiles while others remain convinced , contrary to the findings of the ISG , that such weapons existed and continue to exist . Alternative conspiracy theories and conjecture have been put forward to explain their possible whereabouts . # Stockpiles still hidden conjecture # Appearing on MSNBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Wolfowitz insisted the weapons picture was without change , since Iraq had a lot of time to move stuff , a lot of time to hide stuff . Three weeks later , Lord Butler of Brockwell said upon conclusion of the Butler Review , Iraq is a very big place , there is a lot of sand . .. It is impractical to dig up the whole of Iraq , but for somebody to say ' we are absolutely certain that there is nothing there ' would be a very rash and unfounded thing to say , in our judgment . Former Pentagon investigator Dave Gaubatz alleges he found hidden WMD sites in 2003 , but that his reports were ignored and then destroyed as part of a cover-up by the CIA , Department of Defense , and Bush administration . This allowed a group of Russians , Iraqis and Syrians to dig up the WMDs and move them to Syria . This idea was dismissed by ' ' Wired ' ' , and ' ' Salon ' ' , who pointed out that it required President Bush , military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a massive conspiracy theory . The final report of the Iraq Survey Group , by Charles A. Duelfer , special adviser on Iraqi weapons to the C.I.A. , concluded that any stockpiles had been destroyed long before the war and that transfers to Syria were unlikely . # Stockpiles transported to another country conjecture # Rumors have abounded of possible transportation of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction to foreign countries , namely Syria , Lebanon and Iran , in the weeks before Operation Iraqi Freedom began . John Bolton told the House Committee on Foreign Affairs that these reports give cause for concern . # Alleged Russian involvement # Romanian intelligence defector Ion Mihai Pacepa alleged that an operation for the removal of chemical weapons was prepared by the Soviet Union for Libya , and that he was told over thirty years ago by Romanian President Nicolae Ceauescu , KGB chairman Yury Andropov , and later , Yevgeny Primakov , about the existence of a similar plan for Iraq . It is perfectly obvious , wrote Pacepa , that the Russian GRU agency helped Saddam Hussein to destroy , hide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Iraq in 2003 . After all , Russia helped Saddam get his hands on them in the first place . John Loftus , director of The Intelligence Summit , said in the November 16 , 2007 issue of ' ' FrontPage Magazine ' ' that many documents from Iraq point to WMD being transferred to other countries such as Syria : As stated in more detail in my full report , the British , Ukrainian and American secret services all believed that the Russians had organized a last minute evacuation of CW and BW stockpiles from Baghdad to Syria . His researchers allegedly found a document ordering the concealment of nuclear weapons equipment in storage facilities ' ' under ' ' the Euphrates River a few weeks before the invasion . # Syria # Former Iraqi general Georges Sada claimed that in late 2002 , Saddam had ordered all of his stockpiles to be moved to Syria . He appeared on Fox News ' Hannity &amp; Colmes in January 2006 to discuss his book , ' ' Saddam 's Secrets : How an Iraqi General Defied and Survived Saddam Hussein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 1 , Sada said Saddam took advantage of the June 4 Zeyzoun Dam disaster in Syria by forming an air bridge , loading them onto cargo aircraft and flying them out of the country . # They were moved by air and by ground , 56 sorties by jumbo , 747 , and 27 were moved , after they were converted to cargo aircraft , they were moved to Syria . # In January 2004 , Nizar Nayuf , a Syrian journalist who moved to Western Europe , said in a letter to the Dutch newspaper ' ' De Telegraaf ' ' that he knows the three sites where Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction are kept inside Syria . According to Nayuf 's witness , described as a senior source inside Syrian military intelligence he had known for two years , Iraq 's WMD are in tunnels dug under the town of al-Baida near the city of Hama in northern Syria , in the village of Tal Snan , north of the town of Salamija , where there is a big Syrian air force camp , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , south of Homs city . Nayouf also wrote that the transfer of Iraqi WMD to Syria was organized by the commanders of Saddam Hussein 's Iraqi Republican Guard , including General Shalish , with the help of Assef Shawkat , Bashar Assad 's cousin . Shoakat is the CEO of Bhaha , an import/export company owned by the Assad family . U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice responded to this accusation by saying I do n't think we are at the point that we can make a judgment on this issue . There has n't been any hard evidence that such a thing happened . But obviously we 're going to follow up every lead , and it would be a serious problem if that , in fact , did happen . A similar claim was made by Lieutenant General Moshe Ya'alon , a former Israeli officer who served as chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces from July 2002 to June 2005 . In April 2004 , he was quoted as saying that perhaps they transferred them to another country , such as Syria . General Ya'alon told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He Saddam transferred the chemical agents from Iraq to Syria . The Fall 2005 Middle East Quarterly also reported Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as having said in a December , 2002 appearance on Israel 's Channel 2 , ... chemical and biological weapons which Saddam is endeavoring to conceal have been moved from Iraq to Syria . In February 2006 , Ali Ibrahim al-Tikriti , a former Iraqi general who defected shortly before the Gulf War in 1991 , gave an interview to Ryan Mauro , author of ' ' Death to America : The Unreported Battle of Iraq ' ' and founder of WorldThreats . In the interview , al-Tikriti , who was once known as the Butcher of Basra , told Mauro : # I know Saddam 's weapons are in Syria due to certain military deals that were made going as far back as the late 1980s that dealt with the event that either capitals were threatened with being overrun by an enemy nation . Not to mention I have discussed this in-depth with various contacts of mine who have confirmed what I already knew . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to come for his weapons and the United States was n't going to just let this go like they did in the original Gulf War . He knew that he had lied for this many years and wanted to maintain legitimacy with the pan Arab nationalists . He also has wanted since he took power to embarrass the West and this was the perfect opportunity to do so . After Saddam denied he had such weapons why would he use them or leave them readily available to be found ? That would only legitimize President Bush , whom he has a personal grudge against . What we are witnessing now is many who opposed the war to begin with are rallying around Saddam saying we overthrew a sovereign leader based on a lie about WMD . This is exactly what Saddam wanted and predicted . # Al-Tikriti 's interview was featured prominently on conservative web sites such as FrontPageMag and WorldNetDaily , but did not receive main stream press attention . ' ' Salon ' ' magazine editor Alex Koppelman doubts both Sada 's and al-Tikriti 's story , arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iraq in 1990 would have nullified any previous military deals . The Iraq Survey Group was told that Saddam Hussein periodically removed guards from the Syrian border and replaced them with his intelligence agents who then supervised the movement of banned materials between Syria and Iraq , according to two unnamed defense sources that spoke with The Washington Times . They reported heavy traffic in large trucks on the border before the United States invasion . Earlier , in a telephone interview with ' ' The Daily Telegraph ' ' , the former head of the Iraqi Survey Group , David Kay , said : We know from some of the interrogations of former Iraqi officials that a lot of material went to Syria before the war , including some components of Saddam 's WMD program . Precisely what went to Syria , and what has happened to it , is a major issue that needs to be resolved . Satellite imagery also picked up activity on the Iraq-Syria border before and during the invasion . James R. Clapper , who headed the National Imagery and Mapping Agency in 2003 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly civilian trucks , moving from Iraq into Syria . Clapper suggested the trucks may have contained materiel related to Iraq 's WMD programs . ISG formed a special working group to investigate and consider these claims . Charles Duelfer , head of inspectorate at time of publication , summarized the group 's conclusion : Based on the evidence available at present , ISG judged that it was unlikely that an official transfer of WMD material from Iraq to Syria took place . However , ISG was unable to rule out unofficial movement of limited WMD-related materials . # Jordan # In April 2004 , Jordanian officials announced that they had thwarted a planned chemical attack on Jordan 's intelligence headquarters by Al-Qaeda-linked terrorists that could have killed 20,000 people . Acting under the orders of Abu-Musab al-Zarqawi , self-professed leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq , officials said the plotters entered Jordan from Syria with trucks filled with 20 tons of explosives . Syrian officials denied the claims . U.S. officials stated there was debate within the CIA and other U.S. agencies about whether the intent was to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of sulfuric acid was seized , which can be used as a blister agent , but is more commonly used to increase the size of conventional explosions . Former Iraqi National Security Advisor Georges Sada claimed that the chemicals seized by the Jordanian authorities were smuggled out of the Iraq to Syria before the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 , and that the Syrian regime had given the chemical weapons to Al-Qaeda , however the Syrian regime was strongly anti-Islamist , having previously defeated the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria in the Islamic uprising in Syria , and in the Syrian civil war Islamists ( including al-Qaeda in Iraq ) fought against the Syrian regime . In February 2006 , a Jordanian military court sentenced nine men , including Iraq 's al-Qaeda leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , to death for plotting the attack . Lawyers for the men had argued that confessions had been obtained during two weeks of torture . Zarqawi admitted his group was behind the plot , but denied that chemical weapons were to be used . Two men were jailed for up to 3 years , and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Tribune reported in August 2003 that Iraq 's WMD may have been moved to Lebanon 's heavily fortified Bekaa Valley . According to the story , United States intelligence identified a stream of tractor-trailer trucks moving from Iraq through Syria to Lebanon in the weeks before invasion . WorldNetDaily followed up the same story in May 2004 adding affirmatively much , if not all , of Iraq 's biological and chemical weapons assets are being protected by Syria , with Iranian help , in the Bekaa Valley . Former United States Deputy Undersecretary of Defense John A. Shaw also alleged that the Russians played an extensive role in transporting materials into both Syria and Lebanon , to prevent the United States from discovering them . Shaw claimed trucks were transporting materials to Syria and returning empty . In addition , containers with warnings painted on them were moved to a Beirut hospital basement . They were moved by Russian Spetsnaz ( special forces ) units out of uniform , that were specifically sent to Iraq to move the weaponry and eradicate any evidence of its existence . The People 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WMD equipment . Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Lawrence Di Rita called Shaw 's charges absurd and without any foundation . DiRita noted that Shaw has been directed on several occasions to produce evidence of his wide-ranging and fantastic charges and provide it to the DoD inspector general . To my knowledge , he has not done so . In reply to official denials , Shaw claimed that the Bush administration had made efforts to cover up the intelligence data that he had revealed . Larry DiRita made sure that this story would never grow legs , he said , insisting the Russian clean-up operation was a masterpiece of military camouflage and deception . Former Russian Foreign Intelligence director Evgeny Primakov rejected the story , telling ' ' Kommersant ' ' that all of Shaw 's sensational revelations are complete nonsense . # Iran # In addition to Syria and Lebanon , former deputy commander of U.S. Central Command Lt. General Michael DeLong claimed that some weapons of mass destruction were transported to Iran . Speaking to WABC Radio , he remarked : I do know for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lebanon and Iran . .. We also know that before then , they buried some of the weapons of mass destruction . John Loftus also saw information that led him to believe Iran had acquired illicit material . In a story on Dave Gaubatz , ' ' The Daily Mail 's ' ' Melanie Phillips quoted Loftus as saying Saddam had the last laugh and donated his secret stockpile to benefit Iran 's nuclear weapons programme . Phillips followed up her report by reproducing a letter from John Loftus calling for a congressional investigation of John Negroponte , whom he accused of concealing the information . ' ' Salon ' ' magazine columnist Glenn Greenwald accused Philips of promoting a moronic and deranged conspiracy theory . # Pakistan # Former head of the Indian counter-terrorism division and member of the National Security Advisory Board , B Raman , suggests A.Q. Khan may have assisted in shifting Iraq 's WMD to Pakistan . Writing for the South Asia Analysis Group , he cites unnamed Pakistani sources claiming Khan agreed to aid Iraqi intelligence officials who sought his help in having some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling into the hands of the UN inspectors . According to Raman , Pervez Musharraf has been working hard to see that this is not played up in the Pakistani media . # Indian Ocean # In 2003 , ' ' the Jerusalem Post ' ' reported that Iraq 's WMD might be found on cargo ships that were cruising aimlessly around the Indian Ocean . # Iraqi miscalculation # # Saddam lied to retain power # On 13 December 2003 , Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S. forces during Operation Red Dawn . ' ' Time Online Edition ' ' reports that in his first interrogation he was asked whether Iraq had any WMD . According to an official , his reply was : # No , of course not , the U.S. dreamed them up itself to have a reason to go to war with us . The interrogator continued along this line , said the official , asking : if you had no weapons of mass destruction then why not let the U.N . inspectors into your facilities ? Saddams reply : We did nt want them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # Later , through interrogations in US custody , Saddam revealed that , immediately prior to the start of the 2003 US invasion , he had announced to his generals that there were no WMD . One theory given currency by Charles Duelfer is that Saddam sent out different signals to different people in order to keep them confused and help stay in power . # Saddam was misled # According to ' ' The Guardian ' ' in late 2003 , British officials in Whitehall began circulating a theory that Saddam Hussein and his senior advisers may have been hoodwinked by lower-ranking officers into believing that Iraq really did possess weapons of mass destruction . And as most of the informers for British intelligence were the same high-level advisers close to Saddam , the British were also fooled . The paper adds that this hypothesis is open to the interpretation that the government is searching for an excuse , however implausible , for failure to discover any WMD in Iraq . Commenting on the findings of the Butler intelligence review six months later , ' ' USA Today ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few reliable human sources inside Saddam 's regime . Documents since captured inside Iraq by coalition forces are reported to reveal Saddam 's frustration with weapon inspections . Meeting transcripts record him saying to senior aides : We do n't have anything hidden ! In another , he remarks : When is this going to end ? And another : Do n't think for a minute that we still have WMD . We have nothing .

4 ' ' The Memoirs of a Survivor ' ' is a dystopian novel by Nobel Prize-winner Doris Lessing . It was first published in 1974 by Octagon Press . It was made into a film in 1981 , starring Julie Christie and Nigel Hawthorne , and directed by David Gladwell. # Plot # The story takes place in a near-future Britain where society has broken down due to an unspecified disaster . Family units themselves have broken down and survivors band together into loose units for basic survival . The unnamed narrator ends up with ' custody ' of a teenage girl named Emily Cartwright . Emily herself has unspecified trauma in her past that the main character does not probe at . Hugo , an odd mix of cat and dog , comes with Emily . Due to the growing scarcity of resources , the animal is in constant danger of being eaten . Periodically , the narrator is able , through meditating on a certain wall in her flat , to traverse space and time . Many of these visions are about Emily 's sad childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end of the novel , the main character 's strange new family breaks through dimensional barriers via the wall , and walks into a much better world . # Concept and creation # Author Doris Lessing says this novel grew out of a very hubristic ambition to write an autobiography in dreams . # Reception # Doris Lessing is not afraid to break through the barrier separating the mainstream from the fantastic , to let go of man 's world , writes Marleen S. Barr in her essay in ' ' A Companion to Science Fiction ' ' . She argues that feminist science fiction novels such as ' ' Memoirs of a Survivor ' ' provide an alternate viewpoint that dissolve walls that imprison women within a sexist reality . However , the warping of space and time presented in this novel led scholar Betsy Draine to label it a failure , saying the shifts between realistic and mystical frames are impossible to follow . The New York Review of Books felt the ending , in which Emily leads the other main characters through the walls into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunset . # Themes # The New York Times wrote , Lessing 's message , recognizable from her previous work , is close to W. H. Auden 's ' We must love one another or die ' . Although we will inevitably be defeated and disillusioned , we still need to care about other people . Consciousness becomes a physical boundary represented by the wall of the narrator 's home : the rooms and garden beyond it are areas of the unconscious which she explores . <ref> citation url=http : //books.google.com/books ? **39;209286;TOOLONG title=Fiction , intuition , &amp; creativity first=Angela last=Hague pages=284286 publisher=CUA Press year=2003 Another theme is that of breakdown , both of mechanized Western culture and of adult , mechanical personality .

4 Andrea Brustolon ( 20 July 1662 &amp;ndash ; 25 October 1732 ) was an Italian sculptor in wood . He is known for his furnishings in the Baroque style and devotional sculptures . # Biography # He was trained in a vigorous local tradition of sculpture in his native Belluno , in the Venetian ' ' terraferma ' ' , and in the studio of the Genoese sculptor Filippo Parodi , who was carrying out commissions at Padua and at Venice ( 1677 ) . He spent the years 1678-80 at Rome , where the High Baroque sculpture of Bernini and his contemporaries polished his style . Apart from that , the first phase of Brustolon 's working career was spent in Venice , 1680&amp;ndash ; 1685 . Brustolon is documented at several Venetian churches where he executed decorative carving in such profusion that he must have quickly assembled a large studio of assistants . As with his contemporary in London , Grinling Gibbons almost all the high quality robust Baroque carving in Venice has been attributed to Brustolon at one time or another . In the Venetian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodwork for the synagogue on the ' ' piano nobile ' ' , where the carved , canopied ' ' bimah ' ' is supported on Solomonic columns , which Brustolon had seen in Bernini 's ' ' baldacchino ' ' in the Basilica of St Peter 's . His furniture included armchairs with figural sculptures that take the place of front legs and armrest supports , inspired by his experience of Bernini 's ' ' Cathedra Petri ' ' . The gueridon , a tall stand for a candelabrum , offered Brustolon unhampered possibilities for variations of the idea of a caryatid or atlas : the familiar Baroque painted and ebonized blackamoor gueridons , endlessly reproduced since the eighteenth century , found their models in Brustolon 's work . His secular commissions from Pietro Venier , of the Venier di San Vio family ( a suite of forty sculptural pieces that can be seen in the ' ' Sala di Brustolon ' ' of the Ca ' Rezzonico , Venice ) , from the Pisani of Str , and from the Correr di San Simeone families encourage the attribution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brustolon 's elaborate carved furniture aspired towards the condition of sculpture , such as the Dutch bases for console tables which look like enlargements of the work of the two Van Vianens , Paulus and Adam , perhaps the greatest Dutch silversmiths of the period . These carved pieces display the baroque tendency to develop a form three-dimensionally in space . Brustolon 's walnut , boxwood and ebony pieces transcend ordinary functional limitations of furniture ; they are constructed of elaborately carved figures . The framework of Brustolon 's chairs , side tables and gueridons were carved as gnarled tree branches , with further supports of putti and moors carved in ebony . Backrests of the chairs , which were never touched in the rigidly upright posture that contemporary etiquette demanded , were carved with allegories of vanity , fire and music , etc . The most extravagant piece delivered for Pietro Venier was a large side table and vase-stand of box and ebony , designed as a single ensemble to display rare imported Japanese porcelain vases . The eclectic allegories include Hercules with the Hydra and Cerberus , moors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correr , less extrovert chairs bear female nudes extended along the armrests . For the Pisani , he carved a suite of twelve chairs ( now at the Palazzo Quirinale ) with flowers , fruit , leaves and branches to symbolize the twelve months of the year . Work by Brustolon is at the Villa Pisani at Stra . In 1685 Brustolon returned to the house where he was born at Belluno , and from that time devoted himself mainly to tabernacles and devotional sculptures in walnut , boxwood or ivory . His polychromed ivory ' ' Corpus ' ' from a crucifix is in the Museo Civico di Belluno , which preserves some of Brustolon 's preparatory drawings for frames to be carved with putti displaying emblems . A pair of boxwood sculptures , ' ' The Sacrifice of Abraham ' ' and ' ' Jacob Wrestling with the Angel ' ' , integral with scrolling ' ' barocchetto ' ' stands , were in the collection of Justus Liebig ( Liebigshaus , Frankfort ) .

It lies in the eastern part of the State of Mexico just east of the Federal District of Mexico and is considered part of the Mexico City metropolitan area . # The City # Its church was constructed in 1585 , after being evangelized by the Franciscans and has been considered a city since 1861 . The city had a 2010 census population of 168,720 inhabitants . It is an important center for dairy production as well as the manufacturing of thread and yarn of wool and cotton . A major employer is the San Rafael paper factory . Government sources mention that the helicopter where Francisco Blake Mora traveled collided in this municipality , leaving 8 top government officials dead . # The municipality of Chalco # The municipality , which has an area of 234.72 km ( 90.626 sq mi ) , had a population of 310,130 inhabitants at the 2010 census .

4 The Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad was the first railroad to cross Missouri starting in Hannibal in the northeast and going to St. Joseph , Missouri , in the northwest . It is said to have carried the first letter to the Pony Express on April 3 , 1860 , from a train pulled behind the locomotive ' ' Missouri ' ' . The line connected the second and third largest cities in the state of Missouri prior to the American Civil War . The stage route that it paralleled previously been called the Hound Dog Trail . # History # # Construction in 1850s # Construction on the railroad ( formed during an 1846 meeting at the Hannibal office of John Marshall Clemens , father of Mark Twain ) began in 1851 from both cities . Bonds from counties along the route along with the donation of 600,000 acres ( 2,400 km ) in land voted by Congress paid for construction . The lines met in Chillicothe , Missouri , on February 13 , 1859 . A marker the railroad placed at the site was discovered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Galesburg , Illinois . The line started westward from Hannibal and ran through the Missouri cities of Palmyra , Monroe City , Shelbina , Clarence , Anabel , Macon , Bevier , Callao , New Cambria , Bucklin , Brookfield , Laclede , Meadville , Wheeling , Chillicothe , Mooresville , Breckenridge , Nettleton , Hamilton , Kidder , Cameron , Osborn , Stewartsville , Hemple , Easton , before arriving in St. Joseph . John Rogers , well before he became a popular 19th-century American sculptor , worked in 1856 and 1857 as a mechanic on the railroad . Abraham Lincoln rode the route in 1859 en route to a speech in Council Bluffs , Iowa . The first assignment of Col. Ulysses S. Grant during the American Civil War was protecting the railroad and Pony Express mail . Grant was promoted to brigadier general in August 1861 after the assignment . Shortly after Grant left his assignment , the railroad experienced its worst disaster of the war on September 3 , 1861 , when bushwhackers burned a bridge over the Platte River , causing a derailment that killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge Railroad Tragedy . # Post offices on wheels , 1860s # The first experiment in distributing mails in so-called post offices on wheels was made in 1862 by William A. Davis between Hannibal and St. Joseph , Missouri . It was intended to expedite the connection at St. Joseph with the overland stage , which had replaced the Pony Express routes to the West a year earlier . The H&amp;StJ furnished a baggage car , altered to Davis ' specifications . Similar to a postal route agent 's car , it had a table and a 65-pigeon-hole letter case , but no pouch rack . Davis boarded the westbound train at Palmyra , Missouri , with authority to open the sacks and letter packages which were addressed to the St. Joseph DPO , to remove all California letters , and to make up and sort the mail in a manner identical to the way the St. Joseph DPO would have dispatched it . Davis was paid at the rate of $100.00 per month . The railroad was harassed by guerrillas and by lack of maintenance , resulting in several suspensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War , Railway Post Office ( RPO ) service was re-established on this line , and it became known as the Chicago &amp; Kansas City RPO . In 1867 a consortium of Charles E. Kearney , Robert T. Van Horn , and Kersey Coates persuaded the railroad to build a cutoff at Cameron to Kansas City , Missouri . The railroad , through its subsidiary Kansas City and Cameron Railroad , built a shortcut and the ( 1371ft m Hannibal Bridge over the Missouri River in downtown Kansas City . The bridge established a direct link between Chicago and Texas . It was the first rail bridge across the Missouri River when it opened July 3 , 1869 , and established Kansas City rather than Leavenworth or St. Joseph as the dominant city in the region . # Acquisition by Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad # The Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad used the railroad for through traffic to Chicago almost from the start , and in 1883 acquired it . The rail connection between Hannibal and St. Joseph remained in place for about 125 years . On March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burlington Northern after the Chicago , Burlington and Quincy Railroad merged with 3 other railroads to form the new company . During the mid-1980s , the railroad discontinued service from Brookfield westward to St. Joseph .

The tracks from Laclede westward to St. Joseph no longer remain , while the tracks from Brookfield eastward toward the Mississippi River remain in use by the BNSF. # References

4 # Pre-Columbian and Colonial Settlement # The earliest settlers on Guadeloupe arrived around 300 BC and developed agriculture on the island . They were removed by the more warlike Caribs . It was the Caribs who called the island Karukera , which is roughly translated as island with beautiful waters . They were also the tribe to meet all of the later settlers to the island . Archaeologists suggest that between 800 and 1000 AD drought , desertification and expansion of sand dunes on Guadeloupe led to a period with no active habitation based on the scarcity of remains from the period ; this period coincides historically with the droughts and subsequent collapse of the Mayan civilizations in Mesoamerica . Gradual resettlement and recultivation of the land on Guadeloupe occurred between 1000 AD and the arrival of Columbus . Columbus ' second journey brought him to this island on November 14 , 1493 . He named it for an image in a Spanish monastery he had visited : Santa Mara de Guadalupe de Extremadura , an image of the Virgin Mary venerated at Villuercas , in Guadalupe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years but it was used as a trading post until 1635 after Captain Pierre Belain dEnsambuc had sent explorers to Guadeloupe and decided it would be lucrative to settle and cultivate tobacco on the island ; thus his corporation , the French Compagnie des les de l'Amrique sent 550 men under the leadership of Charles Linard de lOlive to Guadeloupe on June 27 , 1635 . De LOlive waged brutal war against the Caribs in Guadeloupe from 1636 to 1639 , throughout which only 30 to 40 French died . Then in 1640 , reinforcements from St. Christophe of Frenchmen allowed for the colonists to completely crush Carib resistance except for some few who fled to Basse-Terre and would sign a peace treaty with the French colonists in 1641 . Early tobacco cultivation in Guadeloupe through the first half of the 17th century was sustained by relatively small numbers of indentured servants and European laborers under small scale proprietors , and in 1654 80% of the population of Guadeloupe was of European origin , with two-thirds being indentured servants .

From 1672 until 1678allied with Britain until 1674France was at war with the Dutch and faced enormous difficulty defending its colonies in the Caribbean ; it was in this context of defense that Guadeloupe was royally annexed into the Kingdom of France in 1674 . In 1714 , the French general government of the American islands divided in two , and Guadeloupe was placed under the control of the governor on Martinique . # Changes in Europe # From 1759 through 1763 , as a part of the Seven Years ' War , the British took control of the island and the main city Pointe--Pitre was established during these years . The sugar industry on the island was highly profitable and worth 6 million a year . Considerable debate took place in both Britain and France on the question of which was more valuable , Canada for Guadeloupe , both of which Britain had seized in the Seven Years War . The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater strategic value and returned Guadeloupe to France at the Treaty of Paris . The French Revolution unleashed decades of political turmoil , and control of Guadeloupe changed hands a couple of times including 1789 and 1792 . Slavery was abolished by the governor Victor Hugues during this tumultuous time . Guadeloupe experienced the effects of the Reign of Terror from 1794 to 1798 . Meanwhile Louis Delgrs , a mulatto officer , led an uprising in 1802 . He and 800 rebels chose to die rather than submit to the French army . Napoleon reinstated slavery when the French retook the island . The British again held the island for three years beginning in 1810 . It was ceded to Sweden in 1813 after the Napoleonic Wars . However , the Treaty of Paris in 1814 left the island to France again , though the British and Swedish did not fully acknowledge the secession . French control of the island was recognized in the Treaty of Vienna in 1815. # Ending slavery # Like many Caribbean islands , Guadeloupe struggled with the end of slavery .

A worldwide sugar slump began in 1870 , hurting Guadeloupe 's economy . Sugar was bolstered during the First World War . Guadeloupe was of little international concern between this time . Just after the war , in 1923 , it exported its first bananas . The trial of Henry Sidambarom , Justice of the Peace and defender of the cause of Indian workers , began on 23 February 1904 and ended in April 1923 . Following this trial , in 1925 , Raymond Poincar decided to grant French nationality as well as the right to vote to Indian citizens . # Modern times # Though Guadeloupe has been relatively peaceful , political changes have not always been easy .

4 The Arca di San Domenico ( Ark of Saint Dominic ) is a monument containing the remains of Saint Dominic . It is located in Dominics Chapel in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna , Italy . # History # The elaboration of this artistic masterpiece was performed in separate stages by the best sculptors of their time and took almost 500 years to finish . Saint Dominic died in the convent of the church of San Nicol delle Vigne on 6 August 1221 . He was buried behind the altar . The church of San Nicol was expanded into the Basilica of San Domenico between 1228 and 1240 . The remains of the saint were moved in 1233 from its place behind the altar into a simple marble sarcophagus , situated on the floor in the right aisle of the church for the faithful . Since most of the pilgrims , who came in great numbers to see the grave , were not able to see this shrine , hidden by so many people standing in front of it , the need was felt for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new tomb for their founder to Nicola Pisano , the famous sculptor of the pulpit of the Pisa Baptistery . He was certainly responsible for the design of the new sarcophagus , but in 1265 he was already at work on another assignment , the pulpit for the Siena Cathedral . The front side was done in his workshop , partially by Nicola Pisano himself but mostly by his assistant Lapo di Ricevuto . The rectangular sarcophagus was originally borne on caryatid figures . When the Ark was later redesigned , these supports were dispersed and are now tentatively identified in several museums : the archangels Michael and Gabriel ( in the Victoria and Albert Museum , London ) , the statue Faith ( Louvre , Paris ) , a group of three deacons ( in the Bargello , Florence ) and a similar group in the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston . The sarcophagus was relocated in the middle of the church in 1411 . Between 1469 and 1473 a crowning was added on the flat top of the sarcophagus by Niccol dell'Arca and several other masters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who added the statuettes of San Petronio ( the patron saint of Bologna ) , a candlestic-holding angel and San Procolo ( closely recalling the statue of David , made ten years later ) . In 1532 , a step was added between the sarcophagus and the altar slab by Alfonso Lombardi . The Saint Dominics chapel was built by the Bolognese architect Floriano Ambrosini from 1597 , replacing the small gothic chapel from 1413 . The Dominicans wanted a chapel for their founder to match the splendour of the other existing chapels . The fresco on the cupola of the apse ' ' St. Dominics Glory ' ' , a masterpiece by Guido Reni , painted between 1613 and 1615 , matches the artistic value of the underlying Ark of St. Dominic . Finally the whole tomb was put on a marble altar in the 18th century . In a little chapel , on the back of the tomb , is the golden reliquary with the ' ' Head of St. Dominic ' ' , a masterpiece by Jacopo Roseto da Bologna ( 1383 ) . # The sarcophagus # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the shrine . It contains the remains of Saint Dominic in a cypress coffin , with the exception of his head ( which is preserved in the reliquary at the back of the monument ) . Nicola Pisano , already famous for his pulpit in the Pisa Baptistery , was asked in 1264 to construct this sarcophagus . He was certainly responsible for the design , but left the brunt of the work to his workshop , since in 1265 he was already at work on a new commission ( the pulpit for the Siena Cathedral ) . The front side was done in his workshop , partially by Nicola Pisano himself but mostly by his assistant Lapo di Ricevuto. and another famous sculptor Arnolfo di Cambio . The Dominican brother fra Guglielmo da Pisa ( who also designed in 1270 a pulpit in San Giovanni Fuorcivitas in Pistoia ) made a small contribution . According to ' ' Gnudi ' ' ( see ref. ) an anonymous Fifth Master was also involved . A collaboration of several sculptors on a such a large commission was normal practice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saint Dominic in a series of six carved panels . The compositions are neatly filled with figures in organized rows , giving a single approach to space . The sarcophagus is flanked on each corner by statues in high-relief of the Four Doctors of the Church . The scenes are arranged in following sequence from left to right and counterclockwise : *On the left corner stands ' ' Paul the Apostle ' ' . * ' ' St. Dominic resurrects the young Napoleone Orsini , after a fatal fall from his horse ' ' . The expressive face of Saint Dominic , so different from the blander faces in this front panel , is attributed to Arnolfo di Cambio. *In the middle : a high-relief of ' ' A Virgin and Child ' ' . * ' ' The Miracle of the Book rejected by Fire ' ' , acting out a story of Dominics preaching in Fanjeaux , southern France , against the Albigensian heresy . * on the right corner ' ' St. Dominic with the Book and the Scourge ' ' . * ' ' The Angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , representing one of the first miracles of the saint . * The back of the tomb gives two scenes ( each with three episodes ) , divided by a statue of ' ' Christ the Redeemer ' ' . ** On the left a scene of the life of Blessed Reginald of Orlans , founder of the monastery in Bologna ; ' ' the Blessed promises St Dominic to enter the Order ' ' ; ' ' the Blessed falls ill ' ' ; ' ' the Virgin heals him and gives him the habit of the Preaching Friars ' ' ** on the right : ' ' St. Dominic asks pope Innocent III to approve the Order ' ' ; ' ' the pope dreams of the Saint supporting the basilica of the Lateran ' ' ; ' ' the pope approves the foundation of the Order . ' ' * In the corner on the right : a high-relief of ' ' St. Augustine ' ' , author of the Dominican Rule . *The last relief gives two more episodes : ' ' The Apostles Peter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the basilica of St. Peter , and give him the staff and the Book ' ' ( symbols of the Apostolic mission ) ; ' ' the Saint sends his followers out on their mission to preach in the world . ' ' Work on the sarcophagus was finished in 1267 . This sarcophagus , originally with its caryatid supports , was taken as model for other tombs : the shrine of St Peter Martyr in the basilica of San Eustorgio in Milan , the shrine of St Luke ( 1316 ) in the basilica of San Giustina in Padua and the tomb of Beato Bertrando ( c. 1334-1350 ) in Udine. # The crowning # The ambitious addition of a crowning to the sarcophagus was commissioned in 1469 to Niccol da Bari to complete this funeral monument .

4 The Society for Pentecostal Studies ( SPS ) is an American scholarly association of biblical scholars , theologians , and others who are members of Pentecostal churches or are involved in the Charismatic Renewal . It was founded in 1970 . The members of the Society consider themselves responsible for recording the history and developing the theology of these grassroots movements that have influenced Christianity worldwide . # Overview # SPS was first envisioned by three classical Pentecostals , Dr. William W. Menzies of the Assemblies of God , Dr. H. Vinson Synan of the International Pentecostal Holiness Church , and Dr. Horace Ward of the Church of God . The original requirement for membership was adherence to the statement of faith of the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America . However , because nontrinitarians and others were unable to sign the statement for doctrinal reasons , this requirement was eventually eliminated . The purpose of the Society , as defined on its website , is to provide a scholarly forum in which to interpret the Pentecostal movement as well as to stimulate , encourage , recognize , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study the implications of Pentecostal theology in relation to other academic disciplines , seeking a Pentecostal world-and-life view ; and to support fully , to the extent appropriate for an academic society , the statement of purposes of the Pentecostal World Fellowship . The Society holds annual conferences . The organization , which began as a scholarly branch of classical Pentecostalism , is now ecumenical , with over 600 members from all major Christian denominations . For many years , the Society has hosted the meetings of the Roman Catholic/Pentecostal dialogue ( see Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity ) . # Past Presidents # * William W.

4 The Decadent movement was a late 19th-century artistic and literary movement of Western Europe . It flourished in France , but also had devotees in England and throughout Europe , as well as in the United States . # Overview # Decadence was the name given , originally by hostile critics , to several late nineteenth-century writers who valued artifice more than the earlier Romantics ' nave descriptions . Some of them adopted the name , referring to themselves as Decadents . For the most part , they were influenced by the tradition of Gothic novels and by the poetry and fiction of Edgar Allan Poe , and were associated with Symbolism and/or Aestheticism . During the 1880s a group of French writers referred to themselves as Decadents . The classic novel from this group is Joris-Karl Huysmans ' ' ' Against Nature ' ' ( 1884 ) , often considered the first great decadent work , though others attribute this honour to Baudelaire 's works . Prominent scholars of Decadence , such as David Weir , now regard Decadence as a transition between Romanticism and Modernism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Oscar Wilde , Aubrey Beardsley and some artists and writers associated with ' ' The Yellow Book ' ' . In the United States , the brothers Edgar and Francis Saltus wrote decadent fiction and poetry . Symbolism has often been confused with Decadence . Several young writers were referred to derisively in the press as decadent during the mid-1880s . Jean Moras ' manifesto was largely a response to this polemic . A few of these writers embraced the term while most avoided it . Although the aesthetics of Symbolism and Decadence can be considered to be similar in some respects , the two remain distinct . Max Nordau wrote a bestselling attack on the movement , ' ' Degeneration ' ' ( 1892 ) . A detailed study of the movement which attracted wide attention was ' ' The Romantic Agony ' ' ( 1933 ) by Mario Praz. # Artists and writers # * Peter Altenberg * Gabriele d'Annunzio * Konstantin Balmont * David Park Barnitz * Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly * Charles Baudelaire * Franz von Bayros * Aubrey Beardsley * Max Beerbohm * Jan Frans De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chambers * Ernest Dowson * Zinaida Gippius * Remy de Gourmont * Guido Gozzano * Joris-Karl Huysmans * Vojislav Ili * Alfred Kubin * Comte de Lautramont * Jane de La Vaudre * Richard le Gallienne * Jean Lorrain * Arthur Machen * Dmitry Merezhkovsky * Nikolai Minsky * Octave Mirbeau * Robert de Montesquiou * George Moore * Gustave Moreau * Edvard Munch * Grard de Nerval * Vincent OSullivan * Rachilde * Odilon Redon * Charles Ricketts * Arthur Rimbaud * Georges Rodenbach * Frederick Rolfe * Flicien Rops * Arthur Schnitzler * Marcel Schwob * M.P .

4 John Schenck ( sometimes written ' ' Schanck ' ' ) ( 17501823 ) was a captain in the New Jersey Militia during the American Revolutionary War . # Biography # Schenck was born in the now-defunct Amwell Township , Hunterdon County , New Jersey on May 26 , 1750 , the son of Gerret Roelofse Schenck(17191794) and Marytje van Sicklen(17221778) . His ancestors were early Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam who had moved into New Jersey in the 1690s . In 1770 , Schenck married Aida Sutphen ( 17541818 ) , daughter of Aert Sutphen ( 17181798 ) and Jannetje Van Mater ( 1724-aft. 1798 ) , whose ancestors were also part of the New Amsterdam Dutch settlement . When Schenck died on his farm in Amwell Township , he left a sizeable estate . He is buried in Pleasant Ridge Cemetery , in what is now Raritan Township , along with his wife , parents and many of his children . His marker reads In memory of Captain John Schenck , who departed this life August 22 , 1823 , aged 73 years , 2 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Schenck was one of the first residents of Hunterdon County to volunteer to serve as a Minuteman in the months following the Battles of Lexington and Concord . He first served as a lieutenant and then was elected a captain of what was to become a company of the 3rd Regiment Hunterdon Militia . In eight years of service with the Militia , Captain Schenck fought in most of the major battles of the War in New Jersey and Pennsylvania . He was at the battles of Monmouth , Trenton , the Second Battle of Trenton ( where he took command of another 3rd Regiment company after its lieutenants deserted and its captain fell sick ) , Princeton ( where a cannonball took away a tree branch he had stooped to pass under ) , Bound Brook and Germantown. # Ambush of Geary # Captain Schenck is best remembered by the residents of Hunterdon County for a small skirmish ( the Ambush of Geary , as it is called locally ) that took place there on December 14 , 1776 .

2514 ' ' Dryandra sessilis ' ' ( Knight ) Domin ' ' B. sessilis ' ' var. ' ' cordata ' ' <br/> ' ' B. sessilis ' ' var. ' ' cygnorum ' ' <br/> ' ' B. sessilis ' ' var. ' ' flabellifolia ' ' ' ' Banksia sessilis ' ' , commonly known as Parrot Bush , is a species of shrub or tree in the plant genus ' ' Banksia ' ' in the Proteaceae family . It had been known as ' ' Dryandra sessilis ' ' until 2007 , when the genus ' ' Dryandra ' ' was sunk into ' ' Banksia ' ' . Widespread throughout southwest Western Australia , it is found on sandy soils over laterite or limestone , often as an understorey plant in open forest , woodland or shrubland . Encountered as a shrub or small tree up to 6 m ( 20 ft ) in height , it has prickly dark green leaves and dome-shaped cream-yellow flowerheads . Flowering from winter through to late spring , it provides a key source of foodboth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , and species diversity is reduced in areas where there is little or no parrot bush occurring . Several species of honeyeater , some species of native bee , and the European Honey Bee seek out and consume the nectar , while the Long-billed Black Cockatoo and Australian Ringneck eat the seed . The life cycle of ' ' Banksia sessilis ' ' is adapted to regular bushfires . Killed by fire and regenerating by seed afterwards , each shrub generally produces many flowerheads and a massive amount of seed . It can recolonise disturbed areas , and may grow in thickets . ' ' Banksia sessilis ' ' has a somewhat complicated taxonomic history . It was collected from King George Sound in 1801 and described by Robert Brown in 1810 as ' ' Dryandra floribunda ' ' , a name by which it was known for many years . However , Joseph Knight had published the name ' ' Josephia sessilis ' ' in 1809 , which had precedence due to its earlier date , and the specific name was formalised in 1924 . Four varieties are recognised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential , and none of the varieties are commonly seen in cultivation . A profuse producer of nectar , ' ' B. sessilis ' ' is valuable to the beekeeping industry . # Description # **61;4229;TOOLONG ' ' Banksia sessilis ' ' grows as an upright shrub or small tree up to 6 m ( 20 ft ) high , without a lignotuber . In most varieties , new stems are covered in soft , fine hairs that are lost with maturity ; but new stems of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' var. ' ' flabellifolia ' ' are usually hairless . Leaves are blue-green or dark green . Their shape differs by variety : in var. ' ' cygnorum ' ' and var. ' ' flabellifolia ' ' they are wedge-shaped , with teeth only near the apex ; in var. ' ' cordata ' ' they are wedge-shaped , but with teeth along the entire margin ; and in var. ' ' sessilis ' ' they are somewhat broader at the base , sometimes almost oblong in shape . Leaf size ranges from 2 to 6 cm ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.31.6 in ) in width . They may be sessile ( that is , growing directly from the stem without a petiole ) or on a petiole up to 0.5 cm ( 0.2 in ) long . The inflorescences are cream or yellow , and occur in domed heads 4 to 5 cm ( 12 in ) wide , situated at the end of a stem . Each head contains from 55 to 125 individual flowers , surrounded at the base by a whorl of short involucral bracts . As with most other Proteaceae , individual flowers consist of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals , and one long wiry style . The style end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts , but breaks free at anthesis . In ' ' B. sessilis ' ' the perianth is straight , 20 to 32 mm ( 0.81.3 in ) long , and pale yellow . The style is slightly shorter , also straight , and cream-coloured . Thus in ' ' B. sessilis ' ' , unlike many other ' ' Banksia ' ' species , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a showy flower colour change . One field study found that anthesis took place over four days , with the outer flowers opening first and moving inwards . Flowering mostly takes place from July to November , although var. ' ' sessilis ' ' can start as early as May . After flowering , the flower parts wither and fall away , and up to four follicles develop in the receptable ( the base of the flower head ) . Young follicles are covered in a fine fur , but this is lost as they mature . Mature follicles are ovoid in shape , and measure 11.5 cm ( 0.40.6 in ) in length . Most follicles open as soon as they are ripe , revealing their contents : a woody seed separator and up to two winged seeds . # Discovery and naming # Specimens of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' were first collected by Scottish surgeon Archibald Menzies during the visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791 . No firm location or collection date can be ascribed to Menzies ' specimens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georges Sound , Mr. Arch . Menzies , and Menzies ' journal indicates that he collected over a wide area , visiting a different location every day from 29 September to 8 October . In addition to ' ' B. sessilis ' ' , Menzies collected plant material of ' ' B. pellaeifolia ' ' , and seeds of at least four more ' ' Banksia ' ' species . This was therefore an important early collection for the genus , only seven species of which had previously been collected . Menzies ' seed specimens were sent to England from Sydney in 1793 , but his plant material remained with him for the duration of the voyage , during which some material was lost . On his return to England in 1795 , the surviving specimens were deposited into the herbarium of Sir Joseph Banks , where they lay undescribed for many years . The next collection was made in December 1801 , when King George Sound was visited by HMS ' ' Investigator ' ' under the command of Matthew Flinders . On board were botanist Robert Brown , botanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three men gathered material for Brown 's specimen collection , including specimens of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' , although neither Brown 's nor Good 's diary can be used to assign a precise location or date for their discovery of the species . Good also made a separate seed collection , which included ' ' B. sessilis ' ' , and the species was drawn by Bauer . Like nearly all of his field drawings of Proteaceae , Bauer 's original field sketch of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' was destroyed in a Hofburg fire in 1945 . A painting based on the drawing survives , however , at the Natural History Museum in London . On returning to England in 1805 , Brown began preparing an account of his Australian plant specimens . In September 1808 , with Brown 's account still far from finished , Swedish botanist Jonas Dryander asked him to prepare a separate paper on the Proteaceae , so that he could use the genera erected by Brown in a new edition of ' ' Hortus Kewensis ' ' . Brown immediately began a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read to the Linnean Society of London a monograph on the family entitled ' ' On the Proteaceae of Jussieu ' ' . Among the eighteen new genera presented was one that Brown named ' ' Josephia ' ' in honour of Banks . Brown 's paper was approved for printing in May 1809 , but did not appear in print until March the following year . In the meantime , Joseph Knight published ' ' On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae ' ' , which appeared to draw heavily on Brown 's unpublished material , without permission , and in most cases without attribution . It contained the first publication of Brown 's ' ' Josephia ' ' , for which two species were listed . The first , ' ' Josephia sessilis ' ' , was based on one of Menzies ' specimens : This species , discovered by Mr. A. Menzies on the West coast of New Holland , is not unlike some varieties of ' ' Ilex Aquifolium ' ' , and now in his Majesty 's collection at Kew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated , but it is universally accepted that it comes from the Latin ' ' sessilis ' ' ( sessile , stalkless ) , in reference to the sessile leaves of this species . Blame for the alleged plagiarism largely fell on Richard Salisbury , who had been present at Brown 's readings and is thought to have provided much of the material for Knight 's book . Salisbury was ostracized by the botanical community , which undertook to ignore his work as much as possible . By the time Brown 's monograph appeared in print , Brown had exchanged the generic name ' ' Josephia ' ' for ' ' Dryandra ' ' , giving the name ' ' Dryandra floribunda ' ' to Knight 's ' ' Josephia sessilis ' ' . As there were then no firm rules pertaining to priority of publication , Brown 's name was accepted , and remained the current name for over a century . Another significant early collection was the apparent discovery of the species at the Swan River in 1827 . In that year , the colonial botanist of New South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploring expedition under James Stirling . Among the plants that Fraser found growing on the south side of the river entrance was a beautiful species of Dryandra , which was probably this species . Over the course of the 19th century , the principle of priority in naming gradually came to be accepted by botanists , as did the need for a mechanism by which names in current usage could be conserved against archaic or obscure prior names . By the 1920s , ' ' Dryandra ' ' R.Br. was effectively conserved against ' ' Josephia ' ' Knight , although a mechanism for formal conservation was not put in place until 1933 . Brown 's specific name , however , was not conserved , and Karel Domin overturned ' ' Dryandra floribunda ' ' R.Br. by transferring Knight 's name into ' ' Dryandra ' ' as ' ' Dryandra sessilis ' ' ( Knight ) Domin in 1924 . This name was current until 2007 , when all ' ' Dryandra ' ' species were transferred into ' ' Banksia ' ' by Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Banksia sessilis ' ' ( Knight ) A.R.Mast &amp; K.R.Thiele. # Common names # The first common names for this species were literal translations of the scientific names . When published as ' ' Josephia sessilis ' ' in 1809 , it was given the common name ' ' Sessile Josephia ' ' . Brown did not offer a common name when he published ' ' Dryandra floribunda ' ' in 1810 , but later that year the ' ' Hortus Kewensis ' ' translated it as ' ' Many Flowered Dryandra ' ' . This name was also used when the plant was featured in ' ' Curtis 's Botanical Magazine ' ' in 1813 . In Australia , the names ' ' Prickly Banksia ' ' and ' ' Shaving-brush Flower ' ' were offered up by Emily Pelloe in 1921 , the latter because when in bud the flower very much resembles a shaving-brush . ' ' Shaving-brush flower ' ' was still in use as late as the 1950s . The name ' ' Holly-leaved Dryandra ' ' was used when the plant was featured as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western Mail ' ' of 193334 , and this was taken up by William Blackall in 1954 , and was still in use as late as 1970 . Meanwhile , Gardner used the name ' ' Parrot Bush ' ' in 1959 , a name derived from the observation that the blooms attract parrots. , by which the species was already well-known to bee-keepers . This name was widely adopted , and since 1970 has been in almost exclusive usage . The only indigenous names reported for the plant are ' ' Budjan ' ' and ' ' But-yak ' ' . These were published by Ian Abbott in his 1983 ' ' Aboriginal Names for Plant Species in South-western Australia ' ' , with Abbott suggesting that the latter name should be preferred , but with the orthography Pudjak . However , Abbott sources these names to George Fletcher Moore 's 1842 ' ' A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language of the Aborigines ' ' , which in fact attributes these names to the species ' ' Dryandra fraseri ' ' ( now ' ' Banksia fraseri ' ' ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error , or introduced an error of his own . # Taxonomy # # Infrageneric placement # Brown 's 1810 monograph did not include an infrageneric classification of ' ' Dryandra ' ' , and neither did his ' ' Prodromus ' ' , published later that year . In 1830 , however , he introduced the first taxonomic arrangement of ' ' Dryandra ' ' , placing ' ' D. floribunda ' ' in section ' ' Dryandra verae ' ' along with most other species , because its follicles contain a single seed separator . ' ' Dryandra verae ' ' was renamed ' ' Eudryandra ' ' by Carl Meissner in 1845 . Eleven years later Meissner published a new arrangement , retaining ' ' D. floribunda ' ' in ' ' D. ' ' sect . ' ' Eudryandra ' ' , and further placing it in the unranked subgroup ' ' Ilicinae ' ' , because of the similarity of its leaves to those of ' ' Ilex ' ' ( Holly ) . In 1870 , George Bentham published a revised arrangement in his ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Eudryandra ' ' , but abandoned almost all of Meissner 's unranked groups , including ' ' Ilicinae ' ' . ' ' D. floribunda ' ' was instead placed in ' ' D. ' ' ser . ' ' Floribundae ' ' along with four other species with small , mostly terminal flowers , left exposed by their having unusually short floral leaves . Bentham 's arrangement stood for over a hundred years , eventually replaced in 1996 by the arrangement of Alex George . Section ' ' Eudryandra ' ' was promoted to subgenus rank , but replaced by the autonym ' ' D. ' ' subg . ' ' Dryandra ' ' . ' ' D. sessilis ' ' , as this species was now called , was retained in ' ' D. ' ' ser . ' ' Floribundae ' ' , but alone , as the series was redefined as containing only those taxa that apparently lack floral bracts altogether . The placement of ' ' D. sessilis ' ' in George 's arrangement , with 1999 and 2005 amendments , may be summarised as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Banksia ' ' ser . ' ' Dryandra ' ' ) : : ' ' D. ' ' subg .

They also published ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for the ' ' Banksia ' ' taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons , thus redefining ' ' B. ' ' subg . ' ' Banksia ' ' as comprising those that do not . They were not ready , however , to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing ' ' Dryandra ' ' , so as an interim measure they transferred ' ' Dryandra ' ' into ' ' Banksia ' ' at series rank . This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer , but also caused George 's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside . Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele , ' ' B. sessilis ' ' is placed in ' ' B. ' ' subg . ' ' Banksia ' ' , ser . ' ' Dryandra ' ' . # Varieties # Four varieties are recognised : * ' ' B. sessilis ' ' var. ' ' sessilis ' ' is an autonym that encompasses the type material of the species . This is the most widespread variety , occurring from Regans Ford and Moora in the north , south-east to Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kulin . Its blue-green leaves are cuneate ( wedge-shaped ) or oblong , and are usually two to three centimetres long but may reach five . * ' ' B. sessilis ' ' var. ' ' cordata ' ' was published as ' ' Dryandra floribunda ' ' var. ' ' cordata ' ' by Carl Meissner in 1848 . In 1870 , George Bentham published ' ' D. floribunda ' ' var. ' ' major ' ' , but this is now considered a taxonomic synonym of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' var. ' ' cordata ' ' . It has larger inflorescences than var. ' ' sessilis ' ' , as well as larger dark green rather than blue green leaves . It is found in the state 's far southwest , between Capes Leeuwin and Naturaliste , and east to Walpole , and grows on sandy soils over limestone . * ' ' B. sessilis ' ' var. ' ' cygnorum ' ' has its roots in Michel Gandoger 's publication of two new species names in 1919 . He published ' ' Dryandra cygnorum ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1996 both of these were found to refer to the same taxon , which Alex George gave variety rank as ' ' Dryandra sessilis ' ' var. ' ' cygnorum ' ' . The term ' ' cygnorum ' ' is Latin for swan and relates to the Swan River , which runs past the suburb of Melville where the type material was collected . It has smaller dark green leaves only 23 cm ( 0.81.2 in ) long and 0.81.7 cm ( 0.30.6 in ) wide , whose teeth are limited to the distal part of the leaf . The range is along the Western Australian coastline from Dongara southwards past Fremantle , and east to Lake Indoon and Kings Park . * ' ' B. sessilis ' ' var. ' ' flabellifolia ' ' was published by George in 1996 , the type specimen having been collected northwest of Northampton in 1993 . The northernmost of the four varieties , it is found from Kalbarri south to Geraldton and Northampton . There are some scattered records further south towards Moora . Its specific name is derived from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folium ' ' leaf . Its leaves are fan shaped , with a long , toothless lower margin , and a toothed end . Its stems are hairless , unlike the other varieties . # Distribution and habitat # ' ' Banksia sessilis ' ' is endemic to the Southwest Botanical Province , a floristic province renowned as a biodiversity hotspot , located in the southwest corner of Western Australia . This area has a Mediterranean climate , with wet winters and hot , dry summers . ' ' B. sessilis ' ' occurs throughout much of the province , ranging from Kalbarri in the north , south to Cape Leeuwin , east along the south coast as far as Bremer Bay , and inland to Wongan Hills and Kulin . It thus spans a wide range of climates , occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland . It is also absent from the Karri forest in the cool , wet , southwest corner of the province , but even there , ' ' B. sessilis ' ' var. ' ' cordata ' ' occurs along the coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its soil be well-drained . Like most dryandras , it grows well in lateritic soils and gravels , although this species is also found in deep sand , sand over laterite , and sand over limestone . It also occurs in a range of vegetation complexes , including coastal and kwongan heath , tall shrubland , woodland and open forest . It is a common understorey plant in drier areas of Jarrah forest , and forms thickets on limestone soils of the Swan Coastal Plain . ' ' Banksia sessilis ' ' sets a large amount of seed and is an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open areas ; for example , it has been recorded colonising gravel pits in the Darling Scarp . Nothing is known of the conditions that affect its distribution , as its biogeography is as yet unstudied . An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by half in the face of severe change , but unlikely to change much under less severe scenarios . # Ecology # # As food # The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important component of the diet of a number of species of honeyeater . In one study , ' ' B. sessilis ' ' was found to be the main source of nectar for all six species studied , namely the Tawny-crowned Honeyeater ( ' ' Gliciphila melanops ' ' ) , White-cheeked Honeyeater ( ' ' Phylidonyris niger ' ' ) , Western Spinebill ( ' ' Acanthorhynchus superciliosus ' ' ) , Brown Honeyeater ( ' ' Lichmera indistincta ' ' ) , Brown-headed Honeyeater ( ' ' Melithreptus brevirostris ' ' ) , and Black Honeyeater ( ' ' Certhionyx niger ' ' ) . Moreover , ' ' B. sessilis ' ' played an important role in their distributions , with species that feed only on nectar occurring only where ' ' B. sessilis ' ' occurs , and remaining for longest at sites where ' ' B. sessilis ' ' is most abundant . Other honeyeaters that have been recorded feeding on ' ' B. sessilis ' ' include the Red Wattlebird ( ' ' Anthochaera carunculata ' ' ) , Western Wattlebird ( ' ' A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Phylidonyris novaehollandiae ' ' ) . Furthermore , a study of bird species diversity in wandoo woodland around Bakers Hill found that honeyeater species and numbers were much reduced in forest that lacked a ' ' Banksia sessilis ' ' understory ; the plant is a key source of nectar and insects during the winter months . A field study in jarrah forest 9 km south of Jarrahdale , where ' ' B. sessilis ' ' grows in scattered clumps , found that Western Wattlebirds and New Holland Honeyeaters sought out groups of plants with the greatest numbers of new inflorescences , particularly those one or two days after anthesis , where nectar yield was highest . The birds likely recognises these by visual clues . ' ' Banksia sessilis ' ' is also a source of food for the Australian Ringneck ( ' ' Barnardius zonarius ' ' ) , and the Long-billed Black Cockatoo ( ' ' Calyptorhynchus baudinii ' ' ) , which tear open the follicles and consume the seeds . The introduced European Honey Bee ( ' ' Apis mellifera ' ' ) has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , as have seven species of native bee , comprising four species of ' ' Hylaeus ' ' ( including the Banksia Bee ' ' H. alcyoneus ' ' ) , two of ' ' Leioproctus ' ' , and a ' ' Lasioglossum ' ' . # Life cycle # Honeyeaters are clearly the most important pollination vector , as inflorescences from which honeyeaters are excluded generally do not set any fruit . Moreover , honeyeaters have been observed moving from tree to tree with significant loads of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' pollen on their foreheads , beaks and throats , having acquired it by brushing against pollen presenters while foraging for nectar ; experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently deposited on stigmas during later foraging . The flowers of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' have a number of adaptations that serve to encourage outcrossing . Firstly , they are protandrous : a flower 's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen , by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches the period during which the flower is sexually active , so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination . This has proven an effective strategy : almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of presentation . In addition , honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants , rather than between inflorescences on the same plant , at least in high density sites . These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen . When self-fertilisation does occur , whether autogamous or geitonogamous , the resulting seed is almost always aborted , and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100% , at least in high density sites . Limited data for low-density sites , where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently , suggest more of a mixed-mating system . The species is a prolific flowerer , and this , combined with the very high outcrossing rates , results in massive seed output . In one study , the average number of seeds produced per ' ' B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of 2 for ' ' B. dallanneyi ' ' . This exceptionally high fecundity can be understood as an adaption to regular bushfire . Most ' ' Banksia ' ' species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire : ' ' resprouters ' ' survive fire , resprouting from a lignotuber or , more rarely , epicormic buds protected by thick bark ; ' ' reseeders ' ' are killed by fire , but populations are rapidly re-established through the recruitment of seedlings . ' ' B. sessilis ' ' is a reseeder , but it differs from many other reseeders in not being strongly serotinous : the vast majority of seeds are released spontaneously in autumn , even in the absence of fire . The degree of serotiny is a matter of some contradiction in the scientific literature : it has been treated as serotinous , weakly serotinous and non-serotinous . Regardless of the terminology used , the massive spontaneous seed output of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' is its primary survival strategy , and is so effective that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this strategy , together with its relatively long juvenile period , makes it vulnerable to overly frequent fire . Seeds of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' are short-lived , and must germinate in the winter following their release , or they die . They are also very sensitive to heating , and thus killed by bushfire ; in one study , just 30 seconds in boiling water reduced the germination rate from 85% to 22% , and not a single seed survived one minute of boiling . Like most other Proteaceae , ' ' B. sessilis ' ' has compound cluster roots , roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter . These exude a range of carboxylates , including citrate , malonate and ' ' trans ' ' -aconitate , that act as acid phosphatase , allowing the absorption of nutrients from nutrient-poor soils , such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia . # Disease # ' ' Banksia sessilis ' ' is highly susceptible to dieback caused by the introduced plant pathogen ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes root rot ; in fact it is so reliably susceptible that it is considered a good indicator species for the presence of the disease . Most highly susceptible species quickly become locally extinct in infected areas , and in the absence of hosts the disease itself eventually dies out . However , ' ' B. sessilis ' ' , being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground , often colonises old disease sites . The new colonies are themselves infected , and thus ' ' P. cinnamomi ' ' survives at these sites indefinitely . The application of phosphite inhibits growth of ' ' P. cinnamomi ' ' in ' ' B. sessilis ' ' , but does not kill the pathogen . In one study , a foliar spray containing phosphite inhibited the growth of ' ' P. cinnamomi ' ' by over 90% in plants infected with ' ' B. sessilis ' ' two weeks after spraying , and by 66% in plants infected one year after spraying ; yet most plants infected shortly before or after spraying were dead 100 days later , while nearly all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . Phosphite is not known to affect plant growth , but has been shown to reduce pollen fertility : one study recorded fertility reductions of up to 50% , and , in a separate experiment , fertility reductions that persisted for more than a year . Infection of coastal stands of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' by the fungus ' ' Armillaria luteobubalina ' ' has also been recorded . The apparent infection rate of 0.31 is quite slow compared to the progress of other ' ' Armillaria ' ' species through pine plantations. # Cultivation # # History # It is not known whether the seed collection sent to the Royal Botanic Gardens , Kew , by Menzies in 1793 included seeds of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' , but if it did then it did not germinate . The species was successfully germinated , however , from Good 's seed , which was sent from Sydney on 6 June 1802 and arrived at Kew the following year . According to Brown 's notes it was flowering at Kew by May 1806 , and in 1810 it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kewensis ' ' as flowering most part of the Year . In 1813 a flowering specimen from the nursery of Malcolm and Sweet was featured as Plate 1581 in ' ' Curtis 's Botanical Magazine ' ' . By the 1830s the species was in cultivation in continental Europe . It was recorded as being cultivated in the garden of Karl von Hgel in Vienna , Austria in 1831 , and in 1833 it was listed amongst the rare plants that had been introduced into Belgium . Along with several hundred other native Australian plants it was exhibited at plant shows held at Utrecht and Haarlem in the Netherlands in the 1840s and 1850s . By this time , however , English gardeners had already begun to lose interest in the Proteaceae , and by the end of the 19th century European interest in the cultivation of Proteaceae was virtually non-existent . In Australia , there was little interest in the cultivation of Australian plants until the mid-20th century , despite a long-standing appreciation of their beauty as wildflowers . For example , in 1933 and 1934 ' ' The Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Western Australian wildflowers , including a painting of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' . These were subsequently republished in Charles Gardner 's 1935 ' ' West Australian Wild Flowers ' ' . One of the first published colour photographs of the species appeared in William Blackall 's 1954 ' ' How to know Western Australian wildflowers ' ' , but this publication was restricted to plant identification . The species was discussed and illustrated in the 1959 ' ' Wildflowers of Western Australia ' ' , and in the 1973 ' ' Flowers and plants of Western Australia ' ' , but these books did not provide cultivation advice either . Possibly the first published information on the cultivation of ' ' Dryandra ' ' appeared in the magazine ' ' Australian Plants ' ' in June and September 1961 . ' ' D. sessilis ' ' was among the species treated , but as there was not yet any experimental data on cultivation , information was restricted to its aesthetic qualities and the soil in which it naturally occurs . From its inception in 1962 , the Kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of native plants , resulting in two early publications that mentioned the cultivation potential of ' ' B. sessilis ' ' . In 1965 , John Stanley Beard published ' ' Descriptive catalogue of Western Australian plants ' ' , a work of reference in which the horticultural characteristics of the plants concerned could be looked up by the staff , which described ' ' D. sessilis ' ' as an erect shrub with pale yellow flowers appearing from May to October , growing in sand and gravel . Five years later , Arthur Fairall published ' ' West Australian native plants in cultivation ' ' . This presented largely the same information as Beard 's ' ' catalogue ' ' , adding only that the species flowers well in its third season . # Current knowledge # According to current knowledge , ' ' B. sessilis ' ' as an extremely hardy plant that grows in a range of soils and aspects , so long as it is given good drainage , and tolerates both drought and moderate frost . Unlike many dryandras , it grows well on limestone ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent producer of honey . It attracts birds , and is also popular with beekeepers . However , its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens , and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings . It is propagated only from seed , as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible . Germination takes about five or six weeks , and plants may take two years to flower .

Laser pulses delivered through a fiber optic are used to pulverize the stone , avoiding surgery . The technology was licensed to Candela Corporation , which produced the first commercial laser lithotripsy system . # Procedure # A urologist inserts a scope into the urinary tract to locate the stone . The type of the scope may be cystoscope , ureteroscope , renoscope or nephroscope . A laser fiber is inserted through the working channel of the scope , and laser is directly emitted to the stone . The stone is disintegrated and the remaining pieces are washed out of the urinary tract .

This procedure is widely available in most hospitals in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wavelength of 2100nm ( infrared band ) is used to break urinary stones which is ideal for breaking stones ( even hardest ) . In ureteroscopy method , a thin telescope called ureteroscope will be passed through the natural urinary passage from the penis up the bladder into the ureter where the stone is . The Holmium laser fiber can be placed in contact with the stone or adjacent to it . Short Holmium laser pulses create a shockwave that causes fragmentation of the stone . Holmium laser lithotripsy is superior to Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( ESWL ) due to high success rate ( ESWL ca n't break all stones ) and fewer complications . # References # 
514 Matti Kurki , in Swedish ' ' Matts Kurck ' ' , was a legendary Finnish chieftain . If he were a real person , he is thought to have lived in the late 13th century . Folklore tales tell about Matti Kurki , particularly in the Satakunta province ( Vesilahti , Pirkkala ) but also in Lapland . The first written reference to Matti Kurki dates from the 17th century . The best known tale concerns his duel with a ' ' Pohto ' ' , a Russian-Karelian warrior . The battle would have taken place near the Manor of Laukko . Matti Kurki was supposedly the ancestor of the Finnish noble family of Kurki . The lands of the Laukko manor were , according to legends , either compensation for ceding his right to tax the Sami , or for his valor and deeds in the wars against the Danish enemies of the King of Sweden . # Legacy # The name has been used as a traditional name in the Finnish Navy , two ships have so far carried the name in the 20th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19181940 ) *The ' ' Bay ' ' -class frigate ' ' Matti Kurki ' ' ( 19621975 )

' ' The Prime Network was a group of regional sports networks owned by Liberty Media that served several regionalized areas that was in operation between 1988 and late-1996 . While Liberty owned many of these stations , some were affiliates and owned by other companies . As a result , affiliate stations had a choice of what the Prime Network programming they would air and when . # History # The original Prime Ticket Network ( based on Los Angeles ) launched in 1985 as a joint-venture between Lakers and Kings owner Jerry Buss and Bill Daniels . Within a few years Daniels bought out most of Buss 's share and become majority owner . In late 1988 Daniels partnered with Tele-Communications Inc. and Prime Sports Rocky Mountain was launched .

In August 1994 , Daniels sold his share in Prime Ticket and the Prime Network to Liberty Media ( a spin-off of TCI ) . In 1996 , Liberty Media sold 50 percent of their regional Prime Sports channels to News Corporation creating Fox Sports Net and a new company , FOX/Liberty Networks . On November 1 , 1996 , the Prime Network names were dropped for the FSN name nationwide . In 2007 , Liberty bought back FSN Pittsburgh , FSN Rocky Mountain , and FSN Northwest from News Corporation . Some of Prime 's programming rights are held by Margate Entertainment , who also owns the TVS Television Network . Reruns of Prime sports coverage are included on Margate 's ' ' ' ' . # Notable programming # The Prime Network was revolutionary in the sense that it was one of the first sports networks to give live national coverage to regional auto racing series , such as the NASCAR West Series and lower-division national series , such as the ARCA stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to the USAR Hooters ProCup Series from the series ' inception in 1994 until Prime Sports ' demise in November 1996 , when ESPN2 secured the rights to the series from 19971999 .

The network also was the first to televise NASCAR Sprint ( then Winston ) Cup qualifying on a regular basis , mainly for races televised by TBS . Prime also televised a number of NASCAR Busch Series races , including the Goody 's 300 at Daytona , in the early 1990s .

4 The Battle of Viborg Bay ( in Swedish literature known as ' ' Viborgska gatloppet ' ' , the Viborg gauntlet ) was a naval battle fought between Russia and Sweden on July 4 , 1790 , during the Russo-Swedish War ( 1788-1790 ) . The Swedish Navy suffered heavy losses , losing six ships of the line and four frigates , but Gustav III of Sweden eventually ensured a Swedish naval escape through a Russian naval blockade composed of units of the Baltic Fleet , commanded by Admiral Vasili Chichagov . The battle ranks among the world 's largest historical naval battles and also among the most influential , as it introduced the naval battle concept of firepower over mobility . # Background # In 1790 , King Gustav III of Sweden revived his plan for a landing close to St. Petersburg , this time near Viborg . But the plan foundered in a disastrous attack on the Russian fleet at the Battle of Reval on May 13 . A further attack on the Russian fleet off Kronstadt at the beginning of June also failed and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' skrgrdsflottan ' ' ) both retired to Viborg Bay . The stage for the battle was set in the first week of June 1790 . Northern white nights were nearly as light as the day and , to King Gustav 's consternation , unfavourable southwesterly winds prevented the combined Swedish fleets of some 400 vessels from sailing southeast to Swedish-controlled Finnish waters . This allowed the Russian sailing battlefleet and coastal galley fleet to join forces . King Gustav ordered a two-part Swedish naval force of 400 ships ( with 3,000 guns and 30,000 sailor and soldiers ) to anchor temporarily between the islands of Krysserort ( Ristiniemi in Finnish ) , and Biskops ( Severny Berezovy in Russian , Piisaari in Finnish ) just inside the mouth of Bay of Viborg , Russia , in the Gulf of Finland . This strategic position placed the Swedish navy within striking distance of the Russian imperial capital , Saint Petersburg . The sailing battlefleet of 21 ships of the line , 13 frigates , various smaller ships , and 16,000 men , was led by flag-captain Admiral Nordenskild , under command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gustav III of Sweden . The coastal galley flotilla ( ' ' Skrgrdsflottan ' ' ) of 14,000 sailors and army soldiers was led by flag-captain Colonel George de Frese , under personal charge of Gustav III of Sweden . On June 8 , 1790 , the Russian Baltic Fleet under Admiral Vasili Chichagov blockaded the only two navigable channels in and out of Viborg Bay and locked the Swedish fleet in the bay while he waited for Prince Charles Henry of Nassau-Siegen to arrive from Kronstadt with the Russian galley fleet . This blockade consisted of a primary force of 50 ships ( with 2,718 guns and 21,000 men ) , and a secondary force of 20 galleys ( led by Captain Shlissov ) , 8 rowed archipelago frigates ( led by Vice-Admiral Kozlyaninov ) and 52 other rowed galleys . On Chichagov 's orders , four sets of ships ( each with a trailing bomb ship ) were positioned east to west , broadsides to the Swedish force . The first set , led by Major General Pyotr Lezhnev consisted of four ships of the line in the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krysserort and Repiegrund sat a set of five chain-linked ships of the line ; a group of five frigates ( three led by Rear Admiral Pyotr Khanykov and two led by British-born Russian admiral Robert Crown ) further south between Lilla Fiskarna island , the Pensar Islets ( Pensarholmarna ) and the shoreline , and another group of five ships ( including two frigates ) further west at Pitkpaasi . Meanwhile , on June 18 , 1790 , an assault on the Russian galley fleet at Trngsund ( Vysotsk , Uuuras in Finnish ) , ordered by Gustav III of Sweden and started two days earlier , failed due to lack of support of its center force and returned . Shortages of food and water prompted Gustav III of Sweden to act . On June 19 , 1790 , he instructed admiral Nordenskild to formulate a plan for the breakout for when the winds changed , one which would include a distraction with gun sloops at Kanonslupar with an actual breakout at Krysserort , and one which the king would lead personally . Then on July 2 , 1790 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme command at Vyborg Bay , which met in session , and a Swedish reconnaissance force apprehended a Russian unit at Bjrk Sound in the Battle of Bjrk sound . # Battle # On June 21 , 1790 , Prince Nassau-Siegen attacked the Swedes at Bjrk Sound with 89 ships . Then , at nightfall on July 3 ( June 22 OS ) , 1790 Gustav III of Sweden ordered the breakout to commence from Krysserort at 10:00 on the following day . At 02:00 on July 4 , 1790 , Swedish units bombarded Russian shore batteries . At the same time , Swedish sloops , led by Lieutenant Colonel Jacob Trning , attacked a Russian naval unit just west of Vasikansaari Island , west of Bjrk sound . Just prior to 07:00 that morning , Gustav III of Sweden spoke with then captain Johan Puke of the 64-gun ship of the line , the ' ' Dristigheten ' ' ( The Audacity ) , which would lead the breakout . Moments later , Puke , aboard the ' ' Dristigheten ' ' , led a line of ships and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western channel , around the Salvors shallows into the middle of the channel between the shallows and Krysserort , and towards the first Russian ships of the line , the ' ' Seslav ' ' and ' ' Saint Peter ' ' which were part of the Russian Admiral Povalishin 's squadron deployed to block the channel leading to west . This line of ships consisted of the flagship the ' ' Konung Gustaf III ' ' ( with Prince Grand Admiral Duke Carl aboard ) , the ' ' Seraphimerorden ' ' ( with Gustav III of Sweden aboard ) - in the line 's center , the ' ' Manligheten ' ' ( The Manliness , sister ship of the ' ' Dristigheten ' ' ) , the other ships of line , the navy frigates , the frigate ' ' Zemire ' ' , the 70-gun ship of the line ' ' Enigheten ' ' ( The Unity ) , and three fire barges , used to set fire to enemy ships . Meanwhile , the flotilla protected the naval fleet , on a parallel course further west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gustav III transferred onto a smaller sloop . Puke ordered all non-essential personnel below decks and , moments later , the Swedish navy engaged the Russian blockade , splitting between the ' ' Selsav ' ' and the ' ' Saint Peter ' ' . Gustav III of Sweden was rowed through the fire , but the flagship ' ' Konung Gustaf III ' ' was hit and the Grand Admiral Duke Carl injured . While the blockading Russian ships opened fire on the Swedish vanguard the damage caused by the Russian ships was relatively small and all Swedish ships remained fully capable of action . Swedish fire when sailing past the blockading Russian ships however caused severe damage to several of the Russian ships . By the time the main body of the Swedish fleets arrived to the blockade the Russian ships posed no longer any danger to the Swedes . At least one of the Russian ships had suffered a severe list from the damage . Russian frigate squadron west of the Povalishin 's ships was too far out with their visibility obscured by gunpowder smoke to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inactivity of the main body of the Russian fleet of Admiral Chichagov aided the Swedes . Once through the first group of ships , Gustav III of Sweden reboarded the ' ' Seraphimerorden ' ' . The king 's personal ship , the ' ' Amphion ' ' survived with no damage . Further west , the galley fleet line of ships consisting sequentially of the frigates ' ' Styrbjrn ' ' and ' ' Norden ' ' ( North ) , six ' ' Turuma ' ' squadron ships , ' ' Sllan Vrre ' ' ( Rarely Worse ) , the remaining archipelago frigates , Malmberg 's and Hjelmstierna 's coastal squadrons , and Colonel Jacob Tnningen 's assigned gun sloops and gun tenders , passed the first Russian set of ships , then engaged the second . The ' ' Styrbjrn ' ' though subjected to heavy fire , managed to pass through and score several hits on Russian commander Povalishin 's ship and on the bomb ship ' ' Pobeditel ' ' ( Victor ) . As the majority of both Swedish fleets passed through the blockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' ( Postman ) , towed by the 74-gun ship of the line ' ' Enigheten ' ' , set his ship on fire too early . He then , under alcoholic intoxication , committed a series of errors which caused the fireship to drift towards the ' ' Enigheten ' ' , setting it on fire , and then to collide with the Swedish 40-gun frigate ' ' Zemire ' ' , with all three ships exploding in an enormous channel-covering cascade of debris and smoke . The explosion severely damaged or destroyed ships within or trying to get through the blockade . The Russian ship groups blocking the Swedish fleets were disrupted by passing Swedish ships . The Swedish navy lost a total of eight ships ( seven running aground in the heavy smoke from the explosion ) : four grounded ships of the line - the 64-gun ' ' Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotta ' ' ( though her captain , Jindric Johan Nauckhoff , continued firing at the Russian frigates until the end ) , the ' ' Finland ' ' at the Salvors shallows , the 74-gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just south of Reipie , and the 64-gun ' ' mheten ' ' ( ' ' the Tenderness ' ' ) at the Pensar islets - and one shipwrecked ship of the line ( the ' ' Auroras ' ' ) , although the king 's British naval adviser Sidney Smith was saved ; three frigates including the ' ' Uppland ' ' and the ' ' Jarrislawitz ' ' ( Yaroslavets , captured in 1788 from Russia ) , both at the Passaloda shallows . The two Swedish fleets followed separate routes from the bay . The battlefleet accompanied by most of the heavier elements of the archipelago fleet ( such as the archipelago frigates ) sailed to the open sea while the rest of the archipelago fleet followed the much shallower route closer to the land . However the Russian frigate squadron commanded by Crown was deployed expressly to blockade the shallower route which forced the light Swedish gun sloops , gun yawls and galleys to head to more open waters where the waves and winds rendered the Swedish archipelago fleet almost totally incapable of fighting . Noticing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had caused Crown set after them and forced several of the Swedish ships to struck their colors as he threatened to run over the small Swedish ships struggling in the open sea . Crown 's squadron very nearly captured Gustaf III but were turned away almost on the last seconds by the orders from Chichagov to start pursuit of the Swedish battlefleet just as Crown 's frigate was about to capture the ship where Gustaf III was . As the Russians had only sent few prize crews in their hurry to force Swedish ships to surrender most of the Swedish ships which had surrendered raised their flags again or overpowered the prize crews and rejoined the Swedish archipelago fleet once the frigate squadron had been ordered to leave . The Swedish archipelago fleet lost four galleys to the shallows : the ' ' Ehrenpreuss ' ' , the ' ' Palmstierna ' ' , the ' ' Nerika ' ' . These ships were all ran aground at the Pensar islet , close to the second set of Russian ships and the Russian ship ' ' Noli Me Tangere ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nerika ' ' was able get escape while others were forced to struck their colors . Additionally galleys ' ' stergtland ' ' , ' ' Nordstjerneorden ' ' , ' ' Ekeblad ' ' and ' ' Dalarne ' ' were captured by the Russians while the Swedish were trying to avoid Russian frigate squadron blocking the coastal sea route . # Aftermath # The Swedish warships that survived the breakout headed into open seas , assembled at Vidskr skerry just south of Pitkpaasi , and then sailed to Sveaborg fortress near Helsinki , Finland for repairs . Chichagov was late in pursuing the Swedish navy , but pursued them to Sveaborg . The next day , Captain Crown captured the 62-gun ' ' Retvisan ' ' ( Justice in old Swedish spelling ) with the help of the 66-gun ' ' Izyaslav ' ' ( The Imperial Russian Navy would subsequently name other ships Retvisan ) . The Swedish battlefleet retired to Sveaborg for repairs while the Swedish archipelago fleet made for a strong defensive position at Svensksund , near Kotka . An impetuous Russian attack on the Swedish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Svensksund resulted in a disaster for the Russians , and both parties would sue for peace .

4 Keselo is a small medieval fortress just above the village of Omalo in Tusheti ( historic geographic area in eastern Georgia ) . The site is surrounded by the northern slopes of the Greater Caucasus Mountains . It is bordered in the north by Republic of Chechnya and Dagestan , in the east by the Georgian historic provinces Kakheti and Pshav-Khevsureti to the south . The population of the area is mainly ethnic Georgians called Tushs or Tushetians ( ) , However , there are some villages nearby which are populated by Daghestanis. # History # Traditionally Tush peoples abandoned their villages and used towers as temporary shelters during raids on their villages . Keselo was constructed during the Mongol invasion of Georgia in 1230s . It originally had 13 towers . The inhabitants of old Omalo used the towers to protect themselves from the invading Mongols and later raids by Daghestani tribes . By the 20th century , most of the towers were in ruins . However in 2003 , work began to rebuild five towers of the medieval fortress . The project was privately sponsored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia and later by the Keselo Foundation . The restoration was done in accordance with the medieval Tush techniques of constructing fortified towers . A monument was also erected in the nearby village of Dartlo and a tower in Khiso , on the road to Omalo , was also rebuilt . During the work , an array of archaeological artefacts , such as ancient rock art motifs and Bronze Age axes and jewellery , were discovered .

514 Claude Buddy Young ( January 5 , 1926 &amp;ndash ; September 5 , 1983 ) was an American football player . A native of Chicago , he was Illinois state champ in the 100-yard dash . The 5 ' 4 Claude Buddy Young , also known as the Bronze Bullet , had exceptional quickness and acceleration . He is one of the shortest men ever to play NFL football . As a track star at the University of Illinois , he won the National Collegiate Championships in the 100 and 220-yard dash , tied the world record for the 45 and 60-yard dashes ( 6.1 in the latter event ) , and was the Amateur Athletic Union 's 100-meter champion . # Early years # Young was as impressive on the gridiron as on the track . He received scholarship offers from several schools , including the University of Michigan , Drake University , Marquette University and the University of Illinois . He chose Illinois and established himself as a star immediately . In his first game for the Illini , he scampered 64 yards for a touchdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry , he ran for a 30-yard touchdown . In all , in his debut he gained 139 yards on 7 carries , an average of 19.7 yards . Before the season concluded , he scored 10 touchdowns equaling the Big Ten Conference record established by the immortal Red Grange in 1924 . These unusual early successes brought the freshman running back national attention . Not since the days when Red Grange was ripping up the sod ... for Bob Zuppke and the Illini has there been so much pigskin excitement on the University of Illinois Campus . Sportscaster Bill Stern called him The fastest thing in cleats and the runner of the year . Ray Eliot , Young 's coach , referred to him as The best running back I have ever seen . Only a freshman , Young was named to several All-America teams . # Military service # Football , like other aspects of American life , had to endure wartime hardships . Manpower difficulties forced NFL teams to reduce their rosters from 33 to 25 . Some colleges ended football programs for the duration . And most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wartime commitments . Young was no different . In late January 1945 , Young was drafted by the Navy . Initially he reported to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station , but was eventually transferred to the naval base at Fleet City , California . Like many star athletes , Young played football for a service team ; he did n't let the draft stop him from playing the game he loved . Coast service teams , one writer claimed , unquestionably played the toughest football extant during the war . The personnel of the league were 30 percent All-American , 30 percent professional and 40 percent better than the average college squad . In mid-December , the top two coast service teams met for the championship . In an earlier contest the Bluejackets , Buddy 's team , had prevailed 7-0 . The championship game was played in Los Angeles at Memorial Stadium before 65,000 fans . It was one of Buddy Young 's greatest games . After a scoreless first quarter , Young returned a kickoff for a 94 yard touchdown , he ran back another kickoff for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scampered 30 yards for a third . The Bluejackets won the game 45-28 to complete an unbeaten season . They challenged the unbeaten West Point team , but the cadets refused the invitation . Young 's performance won accolades from players , coaches , writers , and fans . Charlie O'Rourke still talks excitedly about the game and Young 's ability . An opponent stated that he had never seen his equal and Aldo Forte remarked : I 've seen the greatest in pro football . None can compare with Young . El Toro coach Dick Hanley , who had coached Northwestern , called Young the greatest college back I 've ever seen . Bluejackets Coach Bill Reinhart declared that he had never seen anything like Buddy Young . Sports columnist Slip Madigan also considered Young superior to Blanchard and Davis . And comedian Bob Hope observed : I 'd heard of black magic ... now I 've seen it ! Rumors circulated that once Young fulfilled his service obligation he would be drafted by the NFL or lured to UCLA to play for the Bruins . Neither proved true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Illini in the 1947 Rose Bowl , where he was named Co-Player of the Game , after Illinois hammered UCLA , 45-14 . World War II proved a major boon to sports integration . Not only did the war promote the ideals of democracy and fair play , it also gave blacks a chance to showcase their talents on college , semi-professional and service teams . In football , three of the most talented minority athletes during the war years were Bill Willis , Marion Motley and Young . Buddy was one of the first black men to play pro football ; he played on teams where he was typically one of two or three black players , and undoubtedly he had his rough spots , but his warm , bubbling personality carried him through , and made him immensely popular . # Professional career # # New York Yankees ( AAFC ) # Young played ten years in pro football .

Young was a threat at several positions : five times in his professional career , he eclipsed 1,000 all purpose yards , and in 1954 , he was selected to the NFL Pro Bowl team . Over his ten year professional career , NFL and AAFL , Young averaged 4.6 yards per carry as a running back , over 15 yards per reception as a receiver , and almost 28 yards per kickoff return , peaking at a remarkable 34.4 yards per return for the Colts in 1953 .

514 The Standing Buddha of the Tokyo National Museum is a remarkable example of Greco-Buddhist statuary . Comparable ones can be found in the Musee Guimet in France , and in the National Museum , New Delhi besides various other museums of South Asia . The statue is dated by the museum to the 1st or 2nd century CE. # Context # Some of the standing Buddhas ( as the one pictured ) were sculpted using the specific Greek technique of making the hands and sometimes the feet in marble to increase the realistic effect , and the rest of the body in another material . Foucher especially considered Hellenistic free-standing Buddhas as the most beautiful , and probably the most ancient of the Buddhas , assigning them to the 1st century BCE , and making them the starting point of the anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha ( The Buddhist art of Gandhara , Marshall , p101 ) . # Development # From another direction , Chinese historical sources and mural paintings in the Tarim Basin city of Dunhuang accurately describe the travels of the explorer and ambassador Zhang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BCE , and the same murals describe the Emperor Han Wudi ( 156-87 BCE ) worshiping Buddhist statues , explaining them as ' ' golden men brought in 120 BCE by a great Han general in his campaigns against the nomads . ' ' Although there is no other mention of Han Wudi worshiping the Buddha in Chinese historical literature , the murals would suggest that statues of the Buddha were already in existence during the 2nd century BCE , connecting them directly to the time of the Indo-Greeks . Later , the Chinese historical chronicle Hou Hanshu describes the enquiry about Buddhism made around 67 CE by the emperor Emperor Ming ( 58-75 CE ) . He sent an envoy to the Yuezhi in northwestern India , who brought back paintings and statues of the Buddha , confirming their existence before that date : : ' ' The Emperor , to discover the true doctrine , sent an envoy to Tianzhu ( Northwestern India ) to inquire about the Buddha 's doctrine , after which paintings and statues of the Buddha appeared in the Middle Kingdom . ' ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition also explains that Nagasena , also known as Menander 's Buddhist teacher , created in 43 BCE in the city of Pataliputra a statue of the Buddha , the Emerald Buddha , which was later brought to Thailand .

4 Haderslevhus ( or Hansborg ) is the name of a castle that once stood in the Danish city of Haderslev , until destroyed by a fire . # History # Like most of the medieval cities of trade , Haderslev had a royal castle , which was called Haderslevhus . The suffix hus ( meaning house ) was commonly used for castles in medieval Denmark ( Koldinghus , Tnderhus , lborghus , Riberhus etc . ) . The castle was first mentioned in sources dating back to 1326 , but it is it was most likely built in the second half of the 13th century , like most Danish city castles . These were home of the governor of the borough ( and later the county ) , who took care of the king 's ( or in Southern Jutland , the duke 's ) possessions in and around the city . In the city castle , the taxes , duties , and fines were paid . Haderslevhus was located in the eastern part of the city , which was surrounded by a moat at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he imposed the Reformation in Haderslev , in 1526 . When Hans the Elder was proclaimed duke of Slesvig and Holstein ( today Southern Jutland and Northern Germany ) , he took up residence in Haderslevhus , which now , in 1544 , was an old , and worn-out building . After a few years , the duke decided to build a new castle , called Hansburger . It was supposed to be a new and modern renaissance palace that suited him much better . As chief architect , he appointed Hercules von Oberberg - one of the most influential architects of the time . The western wing of the building was ready for use in 1562 and the duke moved in . Four years later , in 1566 , the southern wing with the chappelle was completed . After the completion of Hansborg , the old building was demolished , and the area on which it stood for centuries , was sold in bits to the staff of the new palace . A small part of the castle is preserved to this day . In the 1570s , Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hansborg , but he died in 1580 , and therefore did not see the completed castle . After the duke died , the Danish King Frederik the 2nd acquired parts of his lands , including Haderslev , and in 1580-1585 he finished the construction of the last two wings . The palace now stood as a whole - complete with four wings and two towers at the corners . In the area between the castle and the city , one could find stables , economic buildings , and residences for parts of the palace staff . The palace itself spanned over a 80x75m piece of ground - about the size of Kronborg , and a bit bigger than Snderborg Castle . Shortly after the completion of Hansborg , it was decided that the castle should be called by the original name , Haderslevhus -- presumably to follow the old systematic naming of castles in trade cities at the time . So , actually , the castle was only called Hansborg in the short period of time between 1562 to about 1590 . Otherwise , the castles has always been spoken of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle as headquarters in 1627-1629 , and the building was severely damaged . In 1629-1642 a lot of reconstruction took place , but the castle was invaded by Torstenson 's troops in 1643-1645 , and in 1644 , the castle caught fire , and burned to the ground . After this catastrophe , many of the bricks was used for the construction of the Danish Royal Library , and therefore a castle was never rebuilt . Haderslev had lost both of its castles .

10514 Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing ( RM-ODP ) is a reference model in computer science , which provides a co-ordinating framework for the standardization of open distributed processing ( ODP ) . It supports distribution , interworking , platform and technology independence , and portability , together with an enterprise architecture framework for the specification of ODP systems . RM-ODP , also named ' ' ITU-T Rec . X.901-X.904 ' ' and ' ' ISO/IEC 10746 ' ' , is a joint effort by the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) , the International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) and the Telecommunication Standardization Sector ( ITU-T ) . # Overview # The RM-ODP is a reference model based on precise concepts derived from current distributed processing developments and , as far as possible , on the use of formal description techniques for specification of the architecture . Many RM-ODP concepts , possibly under different names , have been around for a long time and have been rigorously described and explained in exact philosophy ( for example , in the works of Mario Bunge ) and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friedrich Hayek ) . Some of these conceptssuch as abstraction , composition , and emergencehave recently been provided with a solid mathematical foundation in category theory . RM-ODP has four fundamental elements : * an object modelling approach to system specification ; * the specification of a system in terms of separate but interrelated viewpoint specifications ; * the definition of a system infrastructure providing distribution transparencies for system applications ; and * a framework for assessing system conformance . The RM-ODP family of recommendations and international standards defines a system of interrelated essential concepts necessary to specify open distributed processing systems and provides a well-developed enterprise architecture framework for structuring the specifications for any large-scale systems including software systems . # History # Much of the preparatory work that led into the adoption of RM-ODP as an ISO standard was carried out by the Advanced Networked Systems Architecture ( ANSA ) project . This ran from 1984 until 1998 under the leadership of Andrew Herbert ( now MD of Microsoft Research in Cambridge ) , and involved a number of major computing and telecommunication companies . Parts 2 and 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 . Parts 1 and 4 were adopted in 1998. # RM-ODP Topics # # RM-ODP standards # RM-ODP consists of four basic ITU-T Recommendations and ISO/IEC International Standards : # Overview : Contains a motivational overview of ODP , giving scoping , justification and explanation of key concepts , and an outline of the ODP architecture . It contains explanatory material on how the RM-ODP is to be interpreted and applied by its users , who may include standard writers and architects of ODP systems . # Foundations : Contains the definition of the concepts and analytical framework for normalized description of ( arbitrary ) distributed processing systems . It introduces the principles of conformance to ODP standards and the way in which they are applied . In only 18 pages , this standard sets the basics of the whole model in a clear , precise and concise way . # Architecture : Contains the specification of the required characteristics that qualify distributed processing as open . These are the constraints to which ODP standards must conform . This recommendation also defines RM-ODP viewpoints , subdivisions of the specification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of information relevant to some particular area of concern . # Architectural Semantics : Contains a formalization of the ODP modeling concepts by interpreting many concepts in terms of the constructs of the different standardized formal description techniques . # Viewpoints modeling and the RM-ODP framework # Most complex system specifications are so extensive that no single individual can fully comprehend all aspects of the specifications . Furthermore , we all have different interests in a given system and different reasons for examining the system 's specifications . A business executive will ask different questions of a system make-up than would a system implementer . The concept of RM-ODP viewpoints framework , therefore , is to provide separate viewpoints into the specification of a given complex system . These viewpoints each satisfy an audience with interest in a particular set of aspects of the system . Associated with each viewpoint is a viewpoint language that optimizes the vocabulary and presentation for the audience of that viewpoint . Viewpoint modeling has become an effective approach for dealing with the inherent complexity of large distributed systems . Current software architectural practices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into several areas of concerns , each one focusing on a specific aspect of the system . Examples include the 4+1 view model , the Zachman Framework , TOGAF , DoDAF and , of course , RM-ODP . A viewpoint is a subdivision of the specification of a complete system , established to bring together those particular pieces of information relevant to some particular area of concern during the analysis or design of the system . Although separately specified , the viewpoints are not completely independent ; key items in each are identified as related to items in the other viewpoints . Moreover , each viewpoint substantially uses the same foundational concepts ( defined in Part 2 of RM-ODP ) . However , the viewpoints are sufficiently independent to simplify reasoning about the complete specification . The mutual consistency among the viewpoints is ensured by the architecture defined by RM-ODP , and the use of a common object model provides the glue that binds them all together . More specifically , the RM-ODP framework provides five generic and complementary viewpoints on the system and its environment : * The ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scope and policies for the system . It describes the business requirements and how to meet them . * The ' ' information viewpoint ' ' , which focuses on the semantics of the information and the information processing performed . It describes the information managed by the system and the structure and content type of the supporting data . * The ' ' computational viewpoint ' ' , which enables distribution through functional decomposition on the system into objects which interact at interfaces . It describes the functionality provided by the system and its functional decomposition . * The ' ' engineering viewpoint ' ' , which focuses on the mechanisms and functions required to support distributed interactions between objects in the system . It describes the distribution of processing performed by the system to manage the information and provide the functionality . * The ' ' technology viewpoint ' ' , which focuses on the choice of technology of the system . It describes the technologies chosen to provide the processing , functionality and presentation of information . # RM-ODP and UML # Currently there is growing interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no widely agreed approach to the structuring of such specifications . This adds to the cost of adopting the use of UML for system specification , hampers communication between system developers and makes it difficult to relate or merge system specifications where there is a need to integrate IT systems . Although the ODP reference model provides abstract languages for the relevant concepts , it does not prescribe particular notations to be used in the individual viewpoints . The viewpoint languages defined in the reference model are abstract languages in the sense that they define what concepts should be used , not how they should be represented . This lack of precise notations for expressing the different models involved in a multi-viewpoint specification of a system is a common feature for most enterprise architectural approaches , including the Zachman Framework , the 4+1 model , or the RM-ODP . These approaches were consciously defined in a notation- and representation-neutral manner to increase their use and flexibility . However , this makes more difficult , among other things , the development of industrial tools for modeling the viewpoint specifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possible derivation of implementations from the system specifications . In order to address these issues , ISO/IEC and the ITU-T started a joint project in 2004 : ITU-T Rec . X.906ISO/IEC 19793 : Information technology - Open distributed processing - Use of UML for ODP system specifications . This document ( usually referred to as ) defines use of the Unified Modeling Language 2 ( UML 2 ; ISO/IEC 19505 ) , for expressing the specifications of open distributed systems in terms of the viewpoint specifications defined by the RM-ODP . It defines a set of UML Profiles , one for each viewpoint language and one to express the correspondences between viewpoints , and an approach for structuring them according to the RM-ODP principles . The purpose of UML4ODP to allow ODP modelers to use the UML notation for expressing their ODP specifications in a standard graphical way ; to allow UML modelers to use the RM-ODP concepts and mechanisms to structure their large UML system specifications according to a mature and standard proposal ; and to allow UML tools to be used to process viewpoint specifications , thus facilitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large software systems . In addition , ITU-T Rec . X.906 ISO/IEC 19793 enables the seamless integration of the RM-ODP enterprise architecture framework with the Model-Driven Architecture ( MDA ) initiative from the OMG , and with the service-oriented architecture ( SOA ) . # Applications # In addition , there are several projects that have used or currently use RM-ODP for effectively structuring their systems specifications : * The COMBINE project * The Reference Architecture for Space Data Systems ( RASDS ) From the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems . * Interoperability Technology Association for Information Processing ( INTAP ) , Japan . * The Synapses European project . # See also # * Enterprise Architecture framework * Enterprise Collaboration Architecture * Enterprise Modelling Methodology/Open Distributed Processing ( EMM/ODP ) * Reference model * Triune Continuum Paradigm * View model * ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 # Notes and references #

19514 ' ' The Family Markowitz ' ' is a 1996 novel , made up of a series of linked short stories written by Allegra Goodman . # Plot summary # Centred around a middle-class American Jewish family , ' ' The Family Markowitz ' ' touches on themes ranging from religiosity to ageing and from homosexuality to intermarriage . The novel tells the story of four main characters : Rose Markowitz ( the matriarch ) , her sons Ed and Henry , and her daughter-in-law Sarah . Through these characters , the reader meets many other members of the family including Ed 's four children , Henry 's wife , and Rose 's stepdaughter. # Characters in ' ' The Family Markowitz ' ' # # Rose Markowitz # ' ' The Family Markowitz ' ' begins by introducing Rose , the matriarch of the Markowitz family .

Henry begins the novel as an employee in an art gallery in California . He is initially presented as a closeted gay man . When he becomes fed-up with the California gay scene , Henry moves to Oxford , England , to manage a Laura Ashley shop , collect antiques , and embrace a traditional European lifestyle .

39514 combatant2 = **6;178767;br Pathet Lao The Battle of Ban Dong was a major battle of the Vietnam War that took place in Laos , involving the North and South Vietnamese armies . The battle lasted from February 8 to March 20 , 1971 . Before Operation Lam Son 719 began , intelligence indicated that North Vietnam had permanently placed logistical units in the Ban Dong area , especially along the Ho Chi Minh Trail . The logistical units were supported by one regular division , with another one ready for rapid deployment . In order to capture Tchepone the district of Ban Dong had to be brought under South Vietnamese control . # Diversions # The initial objective of Lam Son 719 was to capture Ban Dong and the surrounding areas , establish firebases and then find and destroy the enemy . Once the first phase of the operation was completed , the 1st ARVN Infantry Division and its supporting units would move on Tchephone . Again , they would set up strong points , sweep the occupied areas and then find and destroy the enemy . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republic of Vietnam had a diversionery plan drawn up , the aim was to fool the North Vietnamese High Command in regards to South Vietnamese operations . During early February the 147th Marine Brigade , under the command of Colonel Hoang Tich Thong , was airlifted from Da Nang to Dong Ha . The arrival of a South Vietnamese brigade close to the DMZ created an impression that an assault was about to be launched against North Vietnam ; when the 147th Marines Brigade crossed the Dong Ha river using landing craft in an amphibious exercise , the North Vietnamese Army reacted by attacking the South Vietnamese Marines violently . A few days later the 147th Marine Brigade was moved to Khe Sanh as the main ARVN force were preparing for the main operation . # Ban Dong # On February 8 President Nguyen Van Thieu gave the order to attack , with the 1st Airborne Brigade and the 1st Armour Brigade launching an attack on Ban Dong .

Initially the ARVN encountered little resistance , but reconnaissance activities noticed increasing activities of North Vietnamese troops in the area . On March 18 , after heavy casualties were inflicted on the South Vietnamese on Hill 723 , the joint North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces launched a counterattack supported by armour . After some hard fighting , FSB 30 and 31 were overrun . Pressure from the North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire prevented South Vietnamese troops from being resupplied , as a result , ARVN morale collapsed . Taking advantage of the ARVN 's critical situation , the combined Communist forces launched deep thrust into South Vietnamese defensive formations . After nearly three days of fighting , the South Vietnamese took more casualties as the 1st Paratroop Brigade was virtually wiped out by the North Vietnamese Army .

As a young man in Utah Territory , Woolley served as a courier and bodyguard for polygamous leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) in hiding during the federal crusade against polygamy . His career as a religious leader in his own right commenced in the early twentieth century , when he began claiming to have been set apart to keep plural marriage alive by church president John Taylor in connection with the 1886 Revelation . Woolley 's distinctive teachings on authority , morality , and doctrine are thought to provide the theological foundation for nearly ninety percent of Mormon fundamentalist groups . # Early life # Woolley was the third child of Mormon pioneer John W. Woolley and his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop Edwin D. Woolley , a close friend of Brigham Young . According to LDS Church records , Woolley was baptized a member of the church by his father on October 18 , 1868 , aged eleven , and ordained an elder by John Lyon on March 10 , 1873 . Nicknamed Noisy , the boisterous young Woolley frequently dominated ward Elders Quorum discussions . Late in life , he would claim to have received his endowments and been ordained an apostle by Brigham Young on March 20 , 1870 , aged thirteen . On January 5 , 1883 , Woolley married Sarah Ann Roberts in the Endowment House on Temple Square . They had nine children together between 1883 and 1905 : seven sons and two daughters . Woolley served as a Mormon missionary in the Southern United States from October 31 , 1887 , to October 6 , 1889 . Shortly thereafter , he was called to the Seventieth Quorum of the Seventy in Centerville , Utah , and served a second four month mission to Indian Territory from December 6 , 1896 , to April 6 , 1897 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had allegedly taken place during his first mission , wherein he fell deathly ill and only recovered after the resurrected Jesus Christ , Joseph Smith , Brigham Young , and John Taylor intervened on his behalf . # Plural marriage # Between October 1886 and February 1887 , Woolley served as a mail carrier for LDS Church leaders hiding from state authorities during the crackdown on Mormon polygamy.Brian C. Hales , , Mormon History Association , 2003 . During this time , church authorities frequently stayed at the Woolley home in Centerville , Utah . On October 6 , 1912 , Woolley wrote the first known account of the reception of the 1886 Revelation , an enigmatic document in the handwriting of Church President John Taylor . The revelation ( first brought to public attention during the excommunication trial of John W. Taylor , the President 's son , an apostle who had refused to accept the cessation of polygamy ) declared firmly that the Lord had not revoked the New and Everlasting Covenant ( plural marriage ) nor will I , for it is everlasting . According to Woolley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurrected Joseph Smith , founder of the church , at his father 's home in September 1886 . Woolley frequently reiterated this account for the remainder of his life , adding additional details over time . The version which has assumed canonical status among Mormon fundamentalists was compiled by Joseph W. Musser in 1929 , and includes the claim that Smith 's appearance was followed by an eight hour meeting on September 27 , 1886 , at which President Taylor put five men ( Woolley and his father , George Q. Cannon , Samuel Bateman , and Charles Henry Wilcken ) under covenant to ensure that no year passed by without children being born in the principle of plural marriage . According to Woolley , these five men , together with Taylor himself and later Lorenzo Snow or Joseph F. Smith , comprised a seven man Council of Friends holding apostolic authority above that of the LDS Church . This doctrinal claim gave hierarchical structure to the nascent fundamentalist movement , until that time an informal association of LDS dissidents . Woolley 's father , the aged John W. Woolley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organization . The elder Woolley was excommunicated from the LDS Church for performing plural marriages in April 1914 . Woolley was excommunicated from the LDS Church in January 1924 for alleging that Church President Heber J. Grant and apostle James E. Talmage had taken plural wives in the recent past . Woolley variously claimed that he had learned of such behavior because he was employed by the United States Secret Service to spy on LDS Church leaders or because he had been commissioned by Brigham Young to learn of and keep track of activities pertaining to the battle for and against the fullness of the gospel , including Plural Marriage . The official reason for his excommunication was that he was found guilty of pernicious falsehood . Grant publicly denied Woolley 's claims in a General Conference of the church in April 1931. # Mormon fundamentalist leader # Most Mormon fundamentalists believe that , upon his father 's death on December 13 , 1928 , Woolley succeeded him as senior member of the Council of Friends , and thus President of the Priesthood or Prophet . Between March 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordained six new members to the Council , designating them apostles and patriarchs to all the world : J. Leslie Broadbent , John Y. Barlow , Joseph W. Musser , Charles F. Zitting , Dr. LeGrand Woolley , and Louis A. Kelsch , Jr . From at least December 1933 , when Lorin Woolley was critically ill , Leslie Broadbent was designated his Second Elder and successor . Woolley observed , Brother Leslie , you are to me as Oliver Cowdery was to the Prophet Joseph Smith , before Oliver Cowdery apostatized . Despite Woolley 's appointment , some contemporary fundamentalist groups , such as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints ( FLDS Church ) , believe that he was succeeded as Prophet by John Y. Barlow . Although Anderson finds evidence for only two marriages of Lorin Woolley , one to Sarah Ann Roberts in 1883 and another to Goulda Kmetzch in 1932 , Woolley himself claimed to have five wives living in April 1933 . Some of his followers , notably Lynn L. Bishop , have attempted to resolve this discrepancy by speculating that Woolley was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who otherwise appear to have remained single either until Woolley 's death or throughout their lives . Potential candidates in this regard include Alice May , Sarah Viola , Lucy , and Elnora Woolley , whom Bishop argues had married Lorin by at least 1915 . Bishop also notes the possibility of Woolley having wed an anonymous wife in the Yucatn Peninsula , where he claimed to have been divinely translated or teleported on at least one occasion

He played college football at Abilene Christian University . # Early years # After attending Littleton High School , he enrolled at Abilene Christian University without a scholarship . In 1973 as a junior , he led the nation 's small colleges in passing and total offense , with 3,167 yards and 28 touchdowns .

During that season he was named the backup quarterback to Roger Staubach , after having a strong training camp and the trade of Craig Morton to the New York Giants . He is best remembered for his performance in a Thanksgiving Day game in 1974 against the Washington Redskins . Longley then a rookie , came into the game for an injured Roger Staubach with the Cowboys trailing 16-3 in the third quarter , and facing elimination from the playoffs . After hitting Billy Joe Dupree for a 35-yard touchdown pass , he led the Cowboys on a 70-yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , with the Cowboys behind 23-17 and with only 28 seconds left with no time outs , Longley hit Drew Pearson down the middle for a 50-yard hail mary pass touchdown which gave the Cowboys a dramatic 24-23 come from behind victory . Because Longley had no expectation of playing in that game and was completely unprepared , Cowboys lineman Blaine Nye sarcastically called his winning effort the triumph of the uncluttered mind . The game was named the second-best in the history of Texas Stadium by ESPN in 2008 . After a training room incident in which he punched Roger Staubach during the 1976 preseason , the team suspended and eventually traded him to the San Diego Chargers for first and second draft choices , that the Cowboys would eventually use to draft Tony Dorsett. # San Diego Chargers # The San Diego Chargers traded for him with the intention of creating a competition with Dan Fouts , but decided to waive him the following year during the 1977 training camp . # Toronto Argonauts ( CFL ) # He spent part of the 1977 season with the Toronto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Saint Louis Cardinals # The Saint Louis Cardinals signed him in 1978 , but eventually waived him before the season started . # Hamilton Tiger-Cats ( CFL ) # After a year out of football , the Hamilton Tiger-Cats signed him in 1980 , but he could n't make the roster. # Roger Staubach incident # Unfortunately , less than two years after his Thanksgiving Day heroics , Longley , under pressure from Danny White for the back-up QB role , left the Cowboys in disgrace after he landed a blindside punch on Staubach during training camp in Thousand Oaks , California . The infamous sucker punch occurred after Longley and Staubach had fought over a negative remark Longley made about Staubach to fellow Cowboy teammates . Staubach was putting on his shoulder pads on the last day of training camp when Longley hit him in the face without warning and from behind , requiring several stitches to close the wound on Staubach 's face . Longley was immediately traded to the San Diego Chargers where he finished his career with little more success . Apparently , there is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouthing off about teammates , but Gil Brandt said the tiff between Staubach and Longley began with a simple game of boredom .

' Longley challenged Roger to a fight . Roger told him they were going to meet on another field after practice . ' Staubach and Longley took off their helmets and pads .

4 Berissa ( also spelled ' ' Berisa ' ' or ' ' Verissa ' ' ) is a Roman Catholic titular see in the former Roman province of Pontus Polemoniacus , in Asia Minor , which Kiepert and W. M. Ramsay have identified with the modern village of Baulus ( also known as ' ' Bolus ' ' ) , south-west of Tokat. # Ecclesiastical History # In the time of St. Basil it was included in the diocese of Ibora , as appears from letters LXXXVI and LXXXVII of the great bishop , but soon after became an independent bishopric in Armenia Prima , with Sebasteia as metropolis . This important change took place before 458 , when its bishop , Maxentius ( written wrongly Ausentius ) , subscribed with his colleagues of Armenia Prima the synodal letter to the Emperor Leo I ( Mansi , XII , 587-589 ) .

Berissa was a Latin bishopric as late as the fifteenth century , when Paul II appointed the Franciscan Libertus de Broehun to succeed the deceased bishop , John ( Wadding , Annales Minorum , VI , 708 ) .

514 origin = Stanmore , Middlesex Virginia Astley ( born 26 September 1959 ) is an English singer-songwriter most active during the 1980s and 1990s . From the start of her songwriting career in 1980 , Astley took her inspiration from many sources . Her classical training influenced her as did a desire to be experimental with her music . Although more popular in the Far East , most notably Japan , she remains a cult artist in her native England . # Early life # Virginia Astley was born in Watford in 1959 , the second daughter of composer Edwin Astley , noted for TV themes such as ' ' The Saint ' ' , and his wife Hazel Balbirnie , whom he married in 1945 . Virginia Astley 's family was from the Warrington area and lived in Grappenhall , where her elder sister Karen was born in 1947 . The family relocated to Stanmore in Middlesex because of Edwin 's work as a film and TV writer . In the early 1960s he was musical director at ITC Entertainment in Borehamwood , the company responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' ' Danger Man ' ' . In 1968 Karen became the wife of Pete Townshend of The Who . In the 1970s Virginia 's elder brother , Jon Astley , became a tape operator for Eric Clapton and worked his way up to his current activities as a remasterer and producer . # Music career # Virginia began learning piano at the age of six and flute at 14 . After leaving school , she studied at the Guildhall School Of Music . Her first professional appearance in public was as a busker outside South Kensington tube station . In 1980 she auditioned for a new band from Clapham , the Victims of Pleasure . Virginia , playing keyboards , worked with them for a short while playing in clubs and pubs around London . The band released three singles between 1980 and 1982 before splitting up . Afterward , Virginia wrote , arranged and performed music with Skids frontman Richard Jobson for the album ' ' The Ballad Of Etiquette ' ' . Their collaboration continued when Jobson moved to Belgian label Les Disques Du Crpuscule , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of The Original Sin ' ' . She also contributed as part of The Dream Makers ( in collaboration with filmmaker Jean Paul Goude ) for a cover version of La Chanson d'Helene ( Helen 's Song ) , showcasing an early example of her distinctive vocal style . It was during this early period that Virginia started to give serious consideration to releasing her own material ; however , nothing immediately came of these plans . Then in 1981 , she signed to the small UK label Why-Fi and recorded a series of songs . A school friend , Jo Wells ( Kissing the Pink ) and a university friend Nicky Holland both contributed as did Tony Butler , Mark Brzezicki and Peter Hope-Evans . Virginia then received an offer from another Why-Fi artist , Troy Tate , for a supporting band position with The Teardrop Explodes . In the nineties , finding that her musical style was popular in Japan , she went on to collaborate with Asian artists . # Ravishing Beauties ( band ) # Virginia recruited Nicky Holland and another university friend , Kate St. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined The Teardrops in Liverpool during the winter of 1981 for a series of dates at a small clubs and a UK tour in early 1982 . They also recorded with Echo &amp; the Bunnymen , Skids , and Siouxsie and the Banshees . Kate St. John and Nicky Holland went on to maintain solo careers in the 1990s at the time of Virginia 's reemergence in Japan . The Ravishing Beauties did not record as a band , but appeared on radio shows , including a John Peel Session on BBC Radio 1 in April 1982 . The Ravishing Beauties first played at Club Zoo in Liverpool and followed this with the support tour with The Teardrop Explodes . Virginia wrote most of the band 's songs , some of which appeared on her first solo project with Why-Fi . The band was short lived , with St. John first becoming a model and then eventually a member of The Dream Academy , while Holland did session work and joined Tears for Fears . # Solo work # One of the first musicians Astley recorded with was Richard Jobson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a musical backdrop for Jobson 's poetry . This work was released as ' ' The Ballad of Etiquette ' ' in late 1981 . Later , Astley went with Jobson to perform in Japan . She also worked on other people 's projects , including work for Les Disques Du Crpuscule label , playing piano and arranging music for Richard Jobson and Anna Domino . She also had a track on ' ' From Brussels with Love ' ' in 1982 . Sessions followed with Richard Jobson and Russell Webb for the final Skids album ' ' Joy ' ' , which featured Astley on flute and as a backing singer . Astley recorded a solo album , ' ' She Stood Up And Cried ' ' for Crpuscule but this was withdrawn , eventually being released three years later as ' ' Promise Nothing ' ' . She signed with Why-Fi in mid-1981 and recorded an EP called ' ' A Bao A Qu ' ' , the title taken from a Malayan legend featured in Jorge Luis Borges 's 1967 ' ' Book of Imaginary Beings ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Using a demo studio in Wapping called Elephant Studios , Astley recorded the song that was to place her in the indie top 10 ( #8 ) in 1983 : Love 's a Lonely Place to Be , a song of despair and anxiety in spite of its Christmas carol sound . The song would later form part of the 1986 LP ' ' Hope in a Darkened Heart ' ' . In 1982 Virginia also played piano on her brother-in-law Pete Townshend 's album ' ' All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes ' ' . The album ' ' From Gardens Where We Feel Secure ' ' was released in August 1983 and was recorded on Astley 's own label Happy Valley and distributed by Rough Trade , which has since reissued it . The album achieved a place in the top 5 of the indie chart ( #4 ) , but neither single nor album was listed in the mainstream charts . In 1983 Virginia established a more permanent lineup with string players Audrey Riley , Jocelyn Pook and Anne Stephenson , with guests such as drummer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Astley played keyboards on tour with Prefab Sprout around the time of their first album , and she also did sessions for their Kitchenware Records labelmates Martin Stephenson and the Daintees , Vic Godard and Zeke Manyika In 1984 Virginia signed to Arista but left to join Elektra Records UK . Darkness Has Reached its End and Tender were both recorded at this time . When Elektra UK folded she went to WEA where she subsequently recorded the album ' ' Hope in A Darkened Heart ' ' with Ryuichi Sakamoto producing in 1986 . The success of this album in Japan meant that Virginia was asked to sign to Nippon Columbia with whom she recorded a further two albums , ' ' All Shall Be Well ' ' in 1992 and ' ' Had I The Heavens ' ' in 1996 . The following year , the first track from the album , Some Small Hope was released , a collaboration with David Sylvian . Since then , Astley has guested on CDs by both Hideaki Matsuoka and the Silent Poets . Rough Trade , Locust and the London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included every member of her family.Plus the re-issued ' ' From Gardens Where We Feel Secure ' ' with a new cover in 2003 , and in 2006 she released her first album of new material in ten years . Entitled ' ' The Words Between Our Words ' ' . This mini album features Astley reciting her own poetry to a backing of harp music . In 2007 , she premiered a long poem Ecliptic , with flute , harp and birdsong . # Influences # Once Virginia Astley emerged into the music mainstream , the music press published a number of articles about her . She named her influences as poetry and classical music and paid only lip service to rock . She was also interested in synthesisers as her father had introduced her to them . Though her music was original , one can hear strands of Debussy , Satie and Vaughan Williams in there . Benjamin Britten was another influence , especially his use of the War Poets . # Discography # # With Victims of Pleasure # * When You 're Young ( 1980 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Rialto - 7 * Jack and Jill ( 1982 ) , Rialto - 7 # Solo # # #Albums# # * ' ' She Stood Up and Cried ' ' ( 1981 ) , Crpuscule withdrawn before commercial release , issued in 1984 as ' ' Promise Nothing ' ' . * ' ' From Gardens Where We Feel Secure ' ' ( 1983 ) , Rough Trade - UK Indie #4 * ' ' Hope in a Darkened Heart ' ' ( 1986 ) , WEA * ' ' All Shall Be Well ' ' ( 1992 ) , Nippon Columbia * ' ' Had I The Heavens ' ' ( 1996 ) , Nippon Columbia * ' ' The Words Between Our Words ' ' ( 2006 ) - online release credited to Virginia and her daughter Florence Astley * ' ' Maiden Newton Ecliptic ' ' ( 2007 ) , Artension # #Singles , EPs# # * ' ' 4 Bao A Qu ' ' ( 1982 ) , Why-Fi - 10-inch EP * Love 's a Lonely Place to Be ( 1983 ) , Why-Fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rough Trade UK Indie #27 * Tender ( 1985 ) , Elektra * Darkness Has Reached Its End ( 1985 ) , WEA * Le Song ( 1986 ) * Charm ( 1986 ) , WEA Japan * Some Small Hope ( 1987 ) , WEA with David Sylvian 
4 In music theory , a theoretical key or impossible key is a key and scale which exists in theory and practice , but whose corresponding key signature make its notation impractical . Such a key is one whose key signature would contain one or more double-flats or double-sharps . Double-flats and double-sharps are used in music as accidentals , but they are never placed in the key signature ( in music that uses equal temperament ) , due to notational convention and because reading the music would become unnecessarily difficult . For example , the key of D minor is not conventionally used in notated music , because its corresponding key signature would contain a B ( submediant ) . An equal-tempered scale of D minor comprises the same notes as the C minor scale . Under equal temperament the scales sound exactly the same ; such key pairs are said to be enharmonically equivalent . So the theoretical key of D minor is usually practically notated by a key signature of C minor . class= wikitable - The other option is to use either no key signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the B s. # Enharmonic equivalence # While a piece of Western music generally has a home key , a passage within it may modulate to another key , which is usually closely related to the home key ( in the Baroque and early Classical eras ) , that is , close to the original around the circle of fifths . When the key is near the top of the circle ( a key signature of zero or few accidentals ) , the notation of both keys is straightforward . But if the home key is near the bottom of the circle ( a key signature of many accidentals ) , and particularly if the new key is on the opposite side ( in the late Classical and Romantic eras ) , it becomes necessary to consider enharmonic equivalence . In each of the bottom three places on the circle of fifths the two enharmonic equivalents ' ' can ' ' be notated and so do not classify as ' theoretical keys ' : # The need to consider theoretical keys # But when a relative key ascends the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory suggests that double-sharps and double-flats would have to be incorporated into the notated key signature . The following six keys ( which are the parallel major/minor keys of those above ) would require one , two or three double-sharps or double-flats : For example , pieces in the major mode commonly modulate up a fifth to the dominant ; for a key with sharps in the signature this leads to a key whose key signature has an additional sharp . A piece in C which performs this modulation would lead to the theoretical key of G , requiring an eighth sharp , meaning an F in place of the F already present . In order to write that passage with a new key signature , it would become necessary to recast the new section using the enharmonically equivalent key signature of A major . However , such passages are usually notated with the use of accidentals , as in this example from Bach 's Well-Tempered Clavier , in G major ( the overall key is C major ) : # Tunings other than twelve-tone equal-temperament # In a different tuning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several keys do require a double-sharp or double-flat in the key signature , and no longer have conventional equivalents : where there are 19 tones in the scale , the key of B major ( 9 flats ) is equivalent to A major ( 10 sharps ) . In 17 tone equal temperament and 31 tone equal temperament , keys that are enharmonic in a 12 tone system ( for example , C and D minor ) may have to be notated completely differently

4 birthplace = Buenos Aires , Argentina deathplace = Buenos Aires , Argentina Mara Luisa Bemberg ( April 14 , 1922 &amp;ndash ; May 7 , 1995 ) was a Buenos Aires-born Argentine feminist , film writer , director and actress , one of the first Latin American women film directors , and a powerful presence in the intellectual Argentina of 1970-1990 . In her work , she specialized in portraying famous South American women and the Argentine upper class . Bemberg also focused on feminism , with regard to the gender debate and cinematic gaze . Bemberg is arguably Latin America 's foremost female director . # Early years # The daughter of Otto Eduardo Bemberg and Sofa Bengolea , she was born into one of the most powerful families in Argentina , as her great-grandfather , German Argentine immigrant Otto Bemberg , had founded the Quilmes Brewery , the country 's largest , in 1888 . Bemberg grew up in a patrician family . Bemberg never received a high school diploma or a college degree . She was privately tutored by a governess . On October 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Following their marriage and in the midst of the Juan Pern era , the couple moved to Spain , where they had four children before returning to Argentina . One of them , Carlos Miguens Bemberg , would become a well-known businessman . 10 years later she divorced Miguens . Her partner in subsequent years was film producer Oscar Kramer. # Artistic career # In 1949 , Bemberg became involved with the former Smart Theater and afterwards with the Astral Theater . In 1959 , she established and managed Buenos Aires 's ' ' Teatro Del Globo ' ' with her associate , Catalina Wolff . She was one of the founders of the Mar del Plata Film Festival and the Feminist Union in Argentina . Her original efforts to form feminist groups were muffled by the military regime that superseded Pern in the mid-50s . Bemberg was inspired by French novelist and art theorist Andr Malraux , who visited her aunt 's Villa Ocampo in 1959 , and particularly his belief that one must live what one believes . In 1970 , she wrote the script for Ral de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , a successful film on the Argentine upper class with Graciela Borges and Lautaro Mura , and in 1975 the script for Fernando Ayala 's ' ' Triangle of Four ' ' . After her film ' ' Seora de nadie ' ' was censored by the military regime , she went to New York to study acting from Lee Strasberg . Bemberg used that time to understand how to approach a film from an actor 's perspective . Bemberg decided to pursue directing because she was disappointed with how her semi-autobiographical screenplays were interpreted by male directors . She believed that Argentine men suffered from great insecurity and Latin American films portrayed women poorly , and wanted to change what she felt was an uninteresting image of women in Latin American cinema . She founded her own production company , GEA , with Lita Stantic and directed her first film , ' ' Momentos ' ' , which was self-financed , in 1981 . Among her films , she wrote and directed ' ' Seora de nadie ' ' in 1982 , ' ' Camila ' ' in 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lover ordered by Argentine military officer and politician Juan Manuel de Rosas and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ) , ' ' Miss Mary ' ' in 1986 ( featuring British actress Julie Christie ) , and ' ' Yo , la peor de todas ' ' in 1990 ( about the life of Juana Ins de la Cruz , with French actress Dominique Sanda , Argentine actor Hctor Alterio and Spanish actress Assumpta Serna ) . Bemberg 's films were widely popular due to their melodramatic elements , such as with ' ' Camila ' ' , and enjoyed much commercial success . Her last film was 1993 's ' ' De eso no se habla ' ' , starring Italian actor Marcello Mastroianni . At the end of her life , Bemberg was working on a script , based on the story ' ' El impostor ' ' by Silvina Ocampo , a distant relative of hers , which was made into a film in 1997 directed by her longtime collaborator Alejandro Maci . Throughout her career Bemberg worked with longtime producer Lita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London-based stage design firm . Before her death , she bequeathed her personal art collection to the National Museum of Fine Arts . She died of cancer in Buenos Aires on May 7 , 1995 , at age 73. # ' ' Camila ' ' # ' ' Camila ' ' was Bemberg 's first film to gain international recognition . Her longtime producer Lita Stantic brought her a copy of a novel by Enrique Molina based on the life of Argentine socialite Camila O'Gorman . Stantic wanted Bemberg to prove that she could tell a love story . Bemberg was interested in showing Camila as the active pursuer in her relationship and spurning the pillars of family , church and state , freed from what she thought was a role that historians had confined her to . Bemberg was only able to make the film after President Ral Alfonsn outlawed film censorship in 1982 . The film cost US$370,000 to make . # Themes # Scholar Bruce Williams has stated that all of Bemberg 's films show female protagonists transgressing the boundaries and limits of their societies . Her feminist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings . With respect to the formal aspects of her films , Bemberg set her own aesthetics , such as the woman 's look , which she considered was lacking in films and especially in Latin American films . In several interviews Bemberg said that she was inspired by New Zealand producer and director Jane Campion and in particular her movie ' ' The Piano ' ' . Eroticism , female sexuality and women were some of Campion 's themes that Bemberg was most interested in . In an interview Bemberg described why Campion 's films were so inspirational for her : In most films , eroticism for the most part is portrayed from a masculine viewpoint . They speak of their sexual prowess , conquests but--excuse me , I 'm going to be very crude--rarely do they mention their inadequacies , problems with erections , impotence . Of that they do n't speak . On the other hand , it 's my impression that if a woman does n't reach marriage as a virgin , well .. But now it seems to me women are beginning to speak out beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : observing events from a different angle . Film scholars have noted that Bemberg 's entire body of work contains autobiographical elements . Not all of Bemberg 's films were focused on historical events and when they did , Bemberg explains in an interview , she intended to situate the viewer in the period . What interests me is the human beings , not the meticulous and obsessive reconstruction of facsimiles of their surroundings . However , in Bemberg 's last film , ' ' De eso no se habla ' ' ( 1994 ) , although it carries her signature , there is a clear change of tone in this story about the love between a foreigner and a dwarf woman . In this film , she abandons the literal account and chooses the metaphor and the satire , within a customary representation masterly recreated . # Filmography # # Awards # Two of her films were featured at the Venice Film Festival .

4 Yuan Yong ( ) ( died May 17 , 528 ) , n Tuoba Yong ( ) , courtesy name Simu ( ) , formally Prince Wenmu of Gaoyang ( ) , was an imperial prince of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Wei . He was very powerful during the reign of his grandnephew Emperor Xiaoming , and by corrupt means grew very rich . This , however , drew resentment from the populace , and after Emperor Xiaoming 's death in 528 and the subsequent overthrowing of Emperor Xiaoming 's mother Empress Dowager Hu by the general Erzhu Rong , Erzhu had him and over 2,000 other officials slaughtered at Heyin ( , in modern Luoyang , Henan ) . # Background # It is not known when Tuoba Yong was born ; what is known is that he was the sixth of seven sons of Emperor Xianwen , and that his mother was Emperor Xianwen 's concubine Consort Han , who was also the mother of one of his older brothers , Tuoba Gan ( ) . Emperor Xianwen yielded the throne to Tuoba Yong 's oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequently in 476 , probably murdered by Tuoba Yong 's stepgrandmother , Empress Dowager Feng , who then proceeded to assume regency over Emperor Xiaowen . Emperor Xiaowen liked Tuoba Yong for his lack of inhibitions , and while Yuan Yong did not display much talent while young , he believed that Yuan Yong might show those talents later . In 485 , Tuoba Yong was created the Prince of Yingchuan . In 494 , when Emperor Xiaowen moved the capital from Pingcheng ( , in modern Datong , Shanxi ) , Tuoba Yong 's title was changed to the Prince of Gaoyang . In 496 , when Emperor Xiaowen changed the name of the imperial clan from Tuoba to Yuan , Tuoba Yong 's name was changed to Yuan Yong . Subsequently , when Emperor Xiaowen conducted his campaigns against rival Southern Qi , Yuan Yong was put in charge of the important Xiang Province ( , roughly modern Handan , Hebei ) , but he , unlike most of his other brothers , was not given any greater authority during Emperor Xiaowen 's reign . # During Emperor Xuanwu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly powerful , after Emperor Xiaowen 's death in 499 and succession by his oldest son Emperor Xuanwu , unlike his brothers Yuan Xi ( ) the Prince of Xianyang , Yuan Xie the Prince of Pengcheng , and Yuan Xiang ( ) the Prince of Beihai , each of whom received substantial powers . After Yuan Yong served a further stint as the governor of Ji Province ( , modern central Hebei ) , Emperor Xuanwu recalled him to the capital . He participated in Yuan Xiang 's corruption trial in 504 . Whenever Emperor Xuanwu visited Yuan Yong 's mansion , Emperor Xuanwu would pay proper respect to him as an uncle , rather than allowing Yuan Yong to bow to him as a subject to an emperor . # During Emperor Xiaoming 's reign # Emperor Xuanwu died suddenly in 515 . The officials Yu Zhong and Cui Guang ( ) quickly proclaimed Emperor Xuanwu 's young crown prince Yuan Xu emperor ( as Emperor Xiaoming ) and seized power away from Emperor Xuanwu 's wife Empress Gao , whose uncle Gao Zhao , who was also Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to counteract Gao Zhao , Yu and Cui forced Empress Gao to yield regent powers to Yuan Yong and Emperor Xiaowen 's cousin Yuan Cheng ( ) the Prince of Rencheng , and then , Yu and Yuan Yong ambushed Gao Zhao and killed him . Empress Gao was also removed and replaced as empress dowager by Emperor Xiaoming 's mother Consort Hu . Although Yuan Yong and Yuan Cheng were titular regents , real regency powers were in Yu 's hands , and Yu quickly grew exceedingly arrogant and autocratic . The officials Pei Zhi ( ) and Guo Zuo ( ) secretly suggested to Yuan Yong to have Yu 's power stripped . When Yu found out about this , he falsely accused Pei and Guo of crimes , and they were put to death . Yu also wanted to kill Yuan Yong , but Cui resisted , so Yuan Yong was only removed from his posts . Later in 515 , however , Empress Dowager Hu assumed regency powers and quickly stripped Yu of most of his posts , making Yu the governor of Ji Province . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts were reversed , and Yuan Yong accused him of crimes and asked that he be punished . However , Empress Dowager Hu , because Yu had saved her life before , refused to act against Yu , although she recalled Yuan Yong back to the administration to serve in high capacity . During Empress Dowager Hu 's regency , she tolerated officials ' corruption and wealth-gathering , and often added to the wealth-gathering herself by awarding them money and luxuries out of the imperial treasury . Yuan Yong became exceedingly rich at this time , and historians described his wealth as being so great as like a nation 's treasury , and he had 6,000 male servants and 500 female servants . While two other princes , Yuan Chen ( ) the Prince of Hejian and Yuan Rong ( ) the Prince of Zhangwu tried to compete with him , they could not , and it was commonly recognized that Yuan Yong was the richest official at the time . This type of corruption among high level officials had a corrosive effect on Northern Wei 's rule , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrarian revolts throughout the empire . In 520 , Empress Dowager Hu 's brother-in-law , the general Yuan Cha , along with the eunuch Liu Teng ( ) and the palace attendant Hou Gang ( ) , carried out a coup against her , putting her under house arrest . Yuan Cha , however , was respectful of Yuan Yong , and he remained in a position of power , although Yuan Cha was effectively the regent . In 525 , Yuan Yong plotted with both Empress Dowager Hu and Emperor Xiaoming to restore Empress Dowager Hu , and later that year she seized power back from Yuan Cha and forced Yuan Cha to commit suicide . Yuan Yong , as one who participated in her plan , continued in his position of power . # Death # In 528 , with Empress Dowager Hu and Emperor Xiaoming in a conflict after Emperor Xiaoming wanted to put Empress Dowager Hu 's lover Zheng Yan ( ) to death by conspiring with the general Erzhu Rong , Empress Dowager Hu poisoned Emperor Xiaoming and put the young child Yuan Zhao , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throne . Erzhu refused to recognize Yuan Zhao 's imperial authority and advanced on Luoyang , quickly capturing it . He made Yuan Xie 's son Yuan Ziyou emperor ( as Emperor Xiaozhuang ) and threw Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Zhao into the Yellow River to drown . Erzhu then believed that , in order to show his might , he needed to massacre the high level officials , whom the people viewed as corrupt . Under guise that they were needed to attend Emperor Xiaozhuang in sacrificing to heaven , he had them , led by Yuan Yong , report to Heyin , near Luoyang . Then , he had his cavalry surround them and massacre them . Erzhu would later regret this action , and he had Yuan Yong and the other officials killed buried with honor . # Notes # <references/>

4 Even before the outbreak of the American Civil War , the territory of Kansas had been the scene of fighting between anti-slavery and pro-slavery forces . Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state on January 29 , 1861 , three months before the opening battle of the war at Fort Sumter , and at the commencement of the war , the state 's government had no well-organized militia , no arms , accoutrements or supplies , nothing with which to meet the demands , except the united will of officials and citizens . During the years 1859 to 1860 , the military organizations had fallen into disuse or been entirely broken up . # Military activities # The first Kansas regiment was called on June 3 , 1861 , and the seventeenth , the last raised during the Civil War , July 28 , 1864 . The entire quota assigned to the Kansas was 16,654 , and the number raised was 20,097 , leaving a surplus of 3,443 to the credit of Kansas .

The Battle of Baxter Springs , sometimes called the Baxter Springs Massacre , was a minor battle in the War , fought on October 6 , 1863 , near the modern-day town of Baxter Springs , Kansas . On October 25 , 1864 , a series of three battles occurred , the first two in Linn County , Kansas , with the final in Vernon County , Missouri .

These deaths enraged Missourians . Whether they were the catalyst of Quantrill 's Raid is a subject of historical discussion . However , on August 21 , 1863 , William Quantrill led Quantrill 's Raid into Lawrence destroying much of the city and murdering over 150 unarmed men and boys . The Confederate partisans in Missouri rode to Lawrence ( a town long hated by Quantrill and many Southerners ) in response to the deaths of women and children .

4 # History # Venue was the listings magazine for the Bristol and Bath areas of the UK . It was founded in 1982 by journalists who had been working for another Bristol magazine , ' ' Out West ' ' , which had been consciously modelled on London 's Time Out magazine . Originally published fortnightly , ' ' Venue ' ' gained a reputation for the quality and authority of its coverage of the local arts and entertainments scene . It played a leading part in re-establishing Ashton Court Festival and was an early champion of the Bristol Sound in the early 1990s . It continued to play a significant role in nurturing and promoting local art , theatre , film and music until its closure in April 2012 . Venue 's last editor was the playwright Tom Wainwright . ' ' Venue ' ' also had a reputation for investigative reporting of local issues , including health , policing , local politics and environmental matters . ' ' Venue ' ' also featured humour and satire which many found attractive , but which was occasionally criticised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedian Mark Watson and comedy scriptwriter Stephen Merchant both worked for ' ' Venue ' ' when they were younger . Author and reviewer Kim Newman contributed regularly . Another author , Eugene Byrne , one of the magazine 's founders , remained involved with it as Consulting Editor until the magazine ceased publication . In 2000 the company was sold to Bristol United Press ( BUP ) , the company which runs the Bristol Evening Post and Western Daily Press newspapers . BUP in turn was owned by the Northcliffe Newspaper Group , part of the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust group . The takeover by BUP was controversial with many readers , advertisers and staff , particularly because the political outlook of the Daily Mail is the opposite of the values proclaimed by ' ' Venue ' ' . # Weekly Edition # In 2001 , Venue magazine started to publish weekly , and , trading as Venue Publishing , the company diversified further in the years after this . It produced a successful controlled circulation lifestyle monthly , ' ' Folio ' ' ( whose closure was announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its last published issue ) , as well as several annual guides including Eating Out West , Drinking Out West , Days Out West , a Student Guide for Bristol and Bath and a Festival Guide . Venue Publishing also undertook contract publishing , particularly for large local events such as the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta and the Bristol Harbour Festival . In 2005 , Venue Publishing established an in-house design agency , Bang , offering design services to external clients .

514 The 2010 FIBA World Championship , hosted by Turkey , was the international basketball competition contested by the men 's national teams . The tournament ran from August 28 to September 12 , 2010 . It was co-organized by the International Basketball Federation ( FIBA ) , Turkish Basketball Federation and the 2010 Organizing Committee . It was considered as prestigious a competition as the Olympic Basketball Tournament . For the third time ( after the 1986 and 2006 tournaments ) , the World Championship had 24 competing nations . As a result , the group stage games were played in four different cities , and the knockout round was hosted by Istanbul . The United States won the tournament for their fourth time after going undefeated in the Opening Round and beating host Turkey in the final . The draw for the Championship took place on December 15 , 2009 in Istanbul . Teams were drawn into four preliminary round groups of six teams each . Teams first played a round-robin schedule , with the top sixteen teams advancing to the knockout stage . # Bid # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joint bid from former Yugoslav republics Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Serbia , Montenegro , and Slovenia made their final presentation during the FIBA 's 20-member Central Board in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , on December 5 , 2004 . Previously , Australia and New Zealand , Italy , Russia and Puerto Rico announced their intention to bid from the tournament , but withdrew their bids prior to the votes . France won the first round of voting , but Turkey eventually won the right to host after the joint bidders were knocked out in the first round . The tournament was the first time that Turkey has hosted the event and marked the first World Championship held in Europe since the 1998 FIBA World Championship was held in Greece . # Venues # Below is a list of the venues which hosted games during the 2010 FIBA World Championship . Each preliminary round group was hosted in a single arena in Kayseri ( Group A ) , Istanbul ( Group B ) , Ankara ( Group C ) , and zmir ( Group D ) . The knockout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ankara Arena , completed in 2010 , and Kadir Has Arena , completed in 2008 , were built for the championships , while the other three arenas underwent renovations for the event . # Qualifying # Turkey automatically qualified as the host country , and the United States also received an automatic berth for winning the 2008 Olympic Men 's Basketball Tournament . Most other teams secured their places in continental qualifying tournaments ( three from Africa , three from Asia , two from Oceania , four from the Americas , and six from Europe ) . FIBA invited four wild card teams to fill out the twenty-four team field . # Wild cards # The four wild cards were determined by FIBA through criteria . For example , a team must have played in the Zone 's qualification tournament to receive recommendation . Also , in order for every team to have an opportunity for a wild card , a maximum of three teams from any Zone can be allotted a wild card entry . Once these requirements are satisfied , FIBA then looks at other important factors . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team , and government support for the team 's National Federation . As of 2009 , FIBA now requires that wild card candidates pay a late registration fee to be considered . Fourteen teams paid the 500,000 fee to apply for one of the four wild card spots . FIBA then whittled down the teams to eight semifinalists Cameroon , Germany , Great Britain , Korea , Lebanon , Lithuania , Nigeria , and Russia . On Saturday , December 12 , FIBA awarded Germany , Lebanon , Lithuania and Russia the four wild cards . # List of qualified teams # The following 24 teams qualified for the final tournament ( FIBA World Ranking at start of tournament in parentheses ) : ; FIBA Africa ( 3 ) * ( 12 ) * ( 41 ) * ( 43 ) ; FIBA Asia ( 3+1 ) * ( 9 ) * ( 21 ) * ( 38 ) * ( 24 ) ( Wild card ) ; FIBA Americas ( 4+1 ) * ( 1 ) * ( 14 ) * ( 19 ) * ( 10 ) * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) * ( 11 ) * ( 13 ) ; FIBA Europe ( 6+4 ) * ( t15 ) * ( t15 ) * ( 7 ) ( Wild card ) * ( 4 ) * ( 6 ) ( Wild card ) * ( 17 ) ( Wild card ) * ( 5 ) * ( 20 ) * ( 3 ) * ( 18 ) ( Host nation ) # Group Draw # The draw held on December 15 divided the qualified teams into four groups of six , groups A , B , C , and D , as listed for the preliminary round . Aside from the fact that those teams in the same line would not be in the same preliminary round groups , there were no other restrictions on how teams may be drawn . # Squads # At the start of tournament , all 24 participating countries had 12 players on their rosters . Final squads for the tournament were due on August 26 , two days before the start of competition . Angola and the United States were the only teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each had 11 domestic players ) . Slovenia was the only team composed entirely of individuals playing outside the domestic league . The Canada squad also consisted entirely of individuals playing outside the country , but at that time Canada had no professional league operating exclusively in the country ( a minor professional league was scheduled to begin play in 2011 ) . The National Basketball Association , based in the U.S. , has a Canadian team , and several minor leagues operate on both sides of the U.S.Canada border . Four Canadian squad members played in U.S.-based competitionstwo with U.S.-based NBA teams , and two for the same U.S. college team . Forty-one NBA players were selected to compete in the tournament , the most of any league . # Preparation matches # # Acropolis Tournament # Greece and Serbia both began the tournament shorthanded when each had two players suspended for their roles in a brawl at the World Championship tuneup Acropolis Tournament , held in mid-August . The two teams engaged in a chaotic brawl with 2:40 left when Greece 's Antonis Fotsis threatened Serbia 's Milo Teodosi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor and into the locker room tunnel ; the game was thus terminated with final score the score at the time of the interruption ( 7473 for Greece ) . Serbian center Nenad Krsti was arrested and held overnight for throwing a chair in the brawl . For their roles in the melee , Krsti was suspended for the first three games of the tournament , while Teodosi , and Greece 's Fotsis and Sofoklis Schortsanitis were suspended for the first two games . Both Greek coach Jonas Kazlauskas and Serbian coach Duan Ivkovi criticized FIBA for waiting until less than 48 hours before the tournament over a week after the brawl to announce the suspensions , citing the unfairness of playing shorthanded for the first games . Greece eventually won their first two games in spite of the suspensions , while Serbia won two of their first three games . # Bamberg Super Cup # # Preliminary round # The top four finishers in each of the four preliminary round groups advanced to the sixteen team , single-elimination knockout stage , where Group A teams would meet Group B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved the most successful in the first round , as nine of the ten teams advanced to the knockout stage ( only Germany did not progress ) .

The three African and four Asian teams struggled , with only Angola and China reaching the knockout stage after each finished fourth place in their group . There were few surprises in the early round ; each team that advanced to the knockout stage was ranked in the top 20 of the FIBA World Ranking at the time of the tournament . Defending champions Spain struggled early , losing two of their first three games before recovering to finish second in Group D. Argentina and the United States , the two top teams in the FIBA rankings , both cruised to the knockout phase , as the United States went 50 and Argentina went 41 , with their only loss coming to Number 5 ranked Serbia . # Tie-breaking procedure # At the end of the preliminary round , any ties will be broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be applied first to the last : #Game results between tied teams #Goal average between games of the tied teams #Goal average for all games of the tied teams #Drawing of lots # Group A ( Kayseri ) # # Group B ( Istanbul ) # # Group C ( Ankara ) # # Group D ( Izmir ) # # Final round ( Istanbul ) # # Championship bracket # # Consolation bracket # # Eighth-finals # # Quarterfinals # # 5th8th classification # # Semifinals # # Thirdplace game # # Final # # Statistical leaders # # Individual tournament highs # Points Rebounds Assists Blocks Steals Minutes # Individual game highs # class=wikitable !

4 Comprehensive high schools are the most popular form of public high schools in the United States which serve the needs of all students , as compared to the common practice in other nations in which examinations are used to sort students into different high schools for different populations . Some high schools specialize in University-preparatory school academic preparation , some in remedial instruction , and some in vocational instruction . The average comprehensive high school offers more than one course of specialization in its program . Comprehensive high schools generally offer a college preparatory course and one or more scientific or vocational courses . Numerous school districts in the United States also have schools tailored to high-performing students and other students who do not succeed best in a comprehensive environment . However , these schools may also have varying numbers of high-performing student classes . This can lead to unpreparedness in post-secondary education . # See also # * High school * Continuation high school * Alternative high school * Comprehensive school - the equivalent in the UK and elsewhere # References # *

4 ' ' Dearest Christian , I 'm So Very Sorry for Bringing You Here . Love , Dad ' ' is the fourth studio album by American musical duo P.M. Dawn . It was released on October 6 , 1998 , by Gee Street and V2 Records . The album 's title refers to bandmember Attrell Cordes 's newborn son , named Christian . # Critical reception # In a contemporary review , ' ' Rolling Stone ' ' magazine called ' ' Dearest Christian ' ' a bleak record that contains the duo 's smoothest work since 1993 's ' ' The Bliss Album ... ? ' ' and a masterfully romantic album with no stomach for rhapsodic lies . Keith Phipps of ' ' The A.V. Club ' ' wrote that the album confirms the group as one of the most extraordinarily novel acts around . Robert Christgau , writing in ' ' The Village Voice ' ' , felt that Prince Be composed better as an R&amp;B songwriter for the album than on ' ' Jesus Wept ' ' and stated , with a steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riff , he revives his spaced-out spirituality as music if not commodity , transfiguring his grumpy disillusion with melodies , vocal harmonies , and now also guitar parts , all lovingly designed to convince his son Christian to be here now . In a negative review , ' ' NME ' ' magazine found the music boring and described it as fluffy-smooth to the point of suffocation ; so unswervingly gushy it quickly drives you to distraction . In a retrospective review , Allmusic 's Ned Raggett said that some of the songs sound derivative of one another , but that the album contains beauty , ambition , good songs , rich production , and more , enough to justify its existence when so many of the band 's peers had run themselves into the ground . # Track listing # # Music for Carnivores <small> ( Attrell Cordes , Roy Phillips ) </small> 4:34 # Art Deco Halos <small> ( Cordes , Marc Bolan ) </small> 3:32 # Being So Not for You ( I Had No Right ) <small> ( Cordes , Clark Anderson ) </small> 5:26 # Misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Could Be Your Star <small> ( Cordes ) </small> 4:41 # Yang : As Private I 's <small> ( Cordes ) </small> 4:25 # Screaming at Me <small> ( Cordes ) </small> 4:53 # I Hate Myself for You <small> ( Cordes ) </small> 4:21 # No Further Damage <small> ( Cordes , J.

4 Wark on Tweed ( usually referred to simply as Wark ) is a village in the English county of Northumberland . It lies about south west of Berwick-upon-Tweed It is on the south bank of the River Tweed that can be considered the border between England and Scotland . # Landmarks # The ruins of Wark on Tweed castle , originally an early 12th century motte-and-bailey , lie at the west end of the village . The castle ( alternatively referred to as Carham Castle ) was strategically important in the wars between Scotland and England , as the border cuts south from the Tweed not far upstream . The view of Wark for the Scottish and English was therefore uncomfortably or conveniently , respectively , close to Roxburgh , and a good base for English advances into Tweedale . It was demolished and rebuilt on several occasions between the 12th and 16th centuries . It is one of a number of supposed locations for the garter incident behind the naming of the Order of the Garter. # Notable people # *Robert Story ( poet )

The hospital was the result of the successful lobbying efforts of 19th century social reformer , Dorothea Dix . A nine member board of trustees was empowered to appoint a superintendent , purchase land , and construct facilities near Harrisburg . This board of trustees received no compensation for their work . In 1848 , the name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $50,000 was appropriated to begin construction . Patients from all parts of the state would be accepted at the hospital , at the expense of the counties that they belonged ; or , if able they would pay for themselves at a cost of $2.50 per week . This cost included board and medical attention . Originally the hospital only had one building which housed the administration , staff , and patients . Built in 1851 , the Main Building was designed following the Kirkbride Plan which was a very popular building style during the late 19th century . The original capacity of the building was 250 patients , but was later expanded with the removal of dining rooms and the addition of the North and South Branch Buildings . A 130 acre farm was located adjacent to the hospital and provided work therapy for the patients and also enabled the hospital to be self-supporting , by growing its own food , and raising its own livestock . When the first patient was admitted on October 6 , 1851 , every poor district was charged a $2.00 weekly maintenance fee for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for private patients were scheduled to vary between $3.00 and $10.00 based upon ability to pay . In 1869 the Board of Public Charities was created to inspect all public and voluntary charitable institutions in the Commonwealth and to report to the legislature with recommendations concerning their operation . For four decades this unpaid Board and its small staff had no authority to correct the conditions it found within state institutions . Nonetheless , by persuasion and publicity they were able to improve the quality of care in public institutions . A major objective was the removal of the insane from almshouses to the Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital and other state hospitals . A Committee on Lunacy was created within the Board of Public charities in 1883 to oversee the operations of these mental institutions . The early 20th century was a time of great change for Harrisburg State Hospital . The Main Building had become old and was in need of replacement . Between the years 1893 and 1912 the hospital was rebuilt following the Cottage Plan , which became popular at the beginning of the 20th century . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 buildings . Designed and constructed by Pennsylvania architects Addison Hutton and John A. Dempwolf the campus and buildings were meant to represent an Italianate window . The buildings on the male and female sides of the campus mirrored each other until the addition of new buildings in the 1930s . In 1921 the name of the hospital was changed to the Harrisburg State Hospital . Also that year , the Board of Public Charities was abolished and the Department of Public Welfare was created to administer all state hospitals . With the completion of the new Cottage Plan buildings , the hospital had grown considerably larger . Its patient capacity was 2,019 , but at one time it held as many as 2,441 with 437 on parole . The hospital was self-sufficient with its own farm , power plant , and stores ; it became known as the City on the Hill . During war time there was a 50% shortage of attendants , at the lowest level of employment there were as few as one nurse to 166 patients . In June 1945 only 26 of the 92 authorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage resulted in widespread curtailment of services to both the public and patients . Up until 1955 certain administrative responsibilities , such as the selection of the hospital Superintendent and the enactment of rules and regulations governing the hospital were vested in the Board of Trustees of the Harrisburg State Hospital . In 1955 an amendment to the Administrative Code authorized the Department of Public Welfare to assume administrative responsibilities for the Harrisburg State Hospital , relegating its Board of Trustees to specific advisory duties . This act also provided for the appointment of a Commissioner of Mental Health in the Department of Public Welfare who assumed overall responsibility for Pennsylvania 's mental health program . Like other institutions Harrisburg State Hospitals patient population began to fall in the late 20th century . This was due to new medicines being developed and finally deinstitutionalization . The hospital was finally closed on January 27 , 2006 . Today ( 2008 ) the hospital sits on a 200 acre campus with stately buildings in a country setting , in Dauphin County , with a majority of its campus in Susquehanna Township .

514 The Hobart Devils is a defunct basketball team that competed in Australia 's National Basketball League ( NBL ) . Based in Hobart , Tasmania , the team was the only representative from the state of Tasmania for the majority of its tenure , but was one of three teams ( the Geelong Supercats and the Gold Coast Rollers being the other two ) that had their NBL licenses revoked by the league directors in 1996 due to financial difficulties . While not the first time teams had folded in the league , the sudden departure of the Devils , Supercats and Rollers signified that the NBL 's successful era ( between the late 1980s and early 1990s ) was truly over . The state of Tasmania has not fielded a side in the NBL since the departure of the Devils and the re-emergence of any Tasmanian sides in the near future seems unlikely .

During Devils home games the home court arena was often referred to as the Devils Den by local TV commentators . The Devils enjoyed their most successful , and only winning season in NBL competition , in 1987 notching a 14 win 12 loss league record . That team featured good chemistry and a high powered offense , it included key players Steve Carfino , Paul Stanley , Jerry Dennard , Wayne Burden , Peter Mann , Rick Hodges and was coached by American Dave Doc Adkins and led by club president , Tasmanian Wayne Monaghan .

4 The olive oropendola ( ' ' Psarocolius bifasciatus ' ' ) is the largest member of the Icterid family and rivals the Amazonian umbrellabird as the largest passerine bird in South America . It is sometimes placed in the genus ' ' Gymnostinops ' ' instead of ' ' Psarocolius ' ' . As suggested by its name , it is found widely but often in low densities throughout humid lowland forests of the Amazon Basin , with the notable exception of most of the Guiana Shield . It is sometimes split into two species , the western olive oropendola ( ' ' P. yuracares ' ' ) and the eastern Par oropendola ( ' ' P. bifasciatus ' ' ) , but the subspecies ' ' P. y. neivae ' ' is widely recognized as a hybrid swarm , and the vast majority of authorities consider them a single species . # Description # The sexes of this icterid are very different in size : the male is 52 cm ( 21 in ) long and weighs 550 g ( 1.2 lbs ) ; the smaller female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 260 g ( 9.2 oz ) . Confusingly , the name olive oropendola is usually used for this combined species , despite the fact that the nominate subspecies has no olive to its plumage , as its head and chest are black ( these are olive in ' ' P. b. yuracares ' ' ) . The back , wings and belly of this large oropendola are brown , the outer rectrices are yellow ( i.e. tail appears all yellow from below ) , the bare facial skin is pink , the eyes are brown , and the bill is black with an orange tip . The superficially similar green oropendola has an olive back and wing-coverts , lacks extensive bare facial-skin , has a pale bill with an orange tip , and blue eyes . # Behavior # The olive oropendola is a canopy bird that most often is seen flying high over the tops of the trees . Compared to other oropendolas it is a loner most frequently seen alone or in pairs , and drawing less attention to itself than its cousins , despite the greater size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other oropendolas . The breeding colonies are small , usually with fewer than five birds . The nest is a hanging woven ball fibers and vines , 60180 cm long , high in a tree . Relatively little is known about these bird 's breeding habits . The omnivorous diet appears to be fairly catholic . They may eat small vertebrates ( especially amphibians and reptiles ) , large insects , nectar , and fruit . They often travel great distances through the forests , except when lingering around their nesting colony . The song of the olive oropendola is a liquid , gurgling and expanding ' ' **26;23954;TOOLONG ' GLOOP ! ' ' , given as a displaying male falls forward on a perch and rustles his wings over the back . Nasal ' ' raap ' ' and ' ' whrup ' ' calls are given while in flight or when foraging . 
4 ' ' Love Is the Law ' ' is the last studio album released in 1983 by Toyah as a band before Toyah Willcox embarked on her solo career . The album reached #28 in the UK Albums Chart . It was first released on CD in 2005 , which contained five additional bonus tracks . # Background # Toyah said the making of the album was the happiest period of her life . ... In 1983 everything was going right . I was starring in a stage play called ' Trafford Tanzi ' , which won me especially huge critical acclaim , and I was about to star in a film , ' The Ebony Tower ' with Lord Laurence Olivier just as soon as the album was finished . Because my schedule was incredibly full , the band moved into my house in Finchley , London where we transformed my gym into a make-shift recording studio to pre-write and programme all the material in the daytime . I 'd then go to the theatre for five o'clock and meet the band at the Marquee Studios to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a killer timetable but I loved it with a passion , she remembered . ... I was surfing on adrenaline for almost six months and by the time I got to the recording studio at midnight each day I was literally ready to explode , thus the track ' I Explode ' , one of my all time favourites . Sometimes my head would be racing so much that the only way to get me to calm down was to give me a sleeping pill . This is not something I would readily admit , but it was the only way the producer could get me to sit long enough to finish a track and is the reason Rebel of Love and Martian Cowboy sound so relaxed for a Toyah song ! The phrase Love is the law is from ' ' The Book of the Law ' ' , the central sacred text of Thelema , written ( or received ) by Aleister Crowley . I was never a fan of what he represented , which was mainly dark , devious and debauched , but I thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most beautiful to ever be uttered because it crosses every social and tribal divide , she said. cite web # Track listing # # Original LP # # Broken Diamonds ( Willcox/Bogen ) # I Explode ( Willcox/Bogen ) # Rebel Of Love ( Willcox/Bogen ) # Rebel Run ( Willcox/Darlow ) # Martian Cowboy ( **29;4853;TOOLONG ) # Dreamscape ( Willcox/Bogen ) # Time Is Ours ( Willcox/Bogen ) # Love Is The Law ( **29;4884;TOOLONG ) # Remember ( Willcox/Bogen/Darlow ) # The Vow ( Willcox/Bogen/Spalding ) * # 2005 CD bonus tracks # **15;4915;ol <li> Be Proud , Be Loud ( Be Heard ) ( Willcox/Bogen ) </li> <li> Laughing With The Fools ( Willcox/Bogen ) </li> <li> To The Mountains High ( Willcox/Bogen ) </li> <li> Baptised In Fire ( Willcox ) </li> <li> Haunted ( Willcox/Darlow ) </li> </ol> # Personnel # * Toyah Willcox - vocals * Joel Bogen - guitar * Phil Spalding - bass on * Brad Lang - bass on and * * Simon Darlow - keyboards * Andy Duncan - drums and percussion # Production # * Producer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bogen * String arrangements on * : Denys Darlow * Engineers : Simon Hanhart , Phil Harding , Mark Wade * Assistant engineers : Andy Lovell , Mike Higgs , Mike Duffy , Rob Waldron # References #

8514 Although the U.S. Mint maintains that there is no widely accepted and standardized numismatic industry definition of first strike coins , First Strike coins definitely exist in the coin industry . Still , they are recent developments , having been first promoted in 2005 . The most frequently promoted First Strike coins are American Gold Eagle coins , American Silver Eagle coins , American Platinum Eagle coins , and the new American Gold Buffalo coins . One often seen definition of First Strike coins calls them the first coins struck from a new set of dies . Another calls them near-perfect specimens produced within the first few hundred strikings in an edition . The U.S. Mint 's production and distribution practices challenge both definitions . The U.S. Mint does not track the order in which it mints coins during their production and does not segregate or specifically identify the first coins minted from a set of dies . The Mint produces up to fifty percent of the projected sales of new coins weeks prior to their release . Further , the Mint does not necessarily ship coins in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it impossible for promoters of First Strike coins to know that the coins being promoted as First Strike are actually the first coins struck from a new set of dies . The numbering on the boxes of coins shipped from the Mint are for accounting and inventory purposes only and do not reflect the order in which the coins were minted . No U.S. Mint First Strike Program The U.S. Mint has no First Strike program for the minting and distribution of its coins . However , the Mint sometimes does first strikings of new coins , but the first strikings are ceremonial and usually consist of only two coins , which are not set aside but are put into the regular inventory of the new coins . It is probably from these ceremonial strikings that promoters came up the idea of First Strike coins . PCGS and NGC First Strike Coins The premier coin grading services that grade First Strike coins are Professional Coin Grading Service ( PCGS ) and NGC ( Numismatic Guaranty Corporation ) . These two firms ' positions on First Strike coins more clearly explain what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not discuss First Strike coins , but does post the U.S. Mint 's position . However , the NGC website designates as First Strike those coins that were shipped from the U.S. Mint within the first month of their official release . PCGS says that for coins to be labeled First Strike , they must be received within thirty days of commencement of shipping ( or have documentation that proves that the coins were shipped during the first thirty days of a coin 's production . ) NGC does not assert that the coins eligible to be labeled First Strike are among the first coins struck but are coins shipped within the first month of release . Further , NGC includes in the First Strike category coins of early or first release . A general term for these coins is first strikes . In reality , the NGC position on First Strike coins offers the best definition : coins of early or first release . While First Strike coins may be from the first strikings of a new set of dies , in reality there is no way for graders or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are promoting were from the first strikes of new dies . First Strike Not Trademarked Some websites maintain that PCGS trademarked First Strike . However , a search of the U.S. Patent Office 's website does not evidence that , and a search of the PGCS website did not find any claim of having trademarked First Strike . NGC asserts there is no trademark for First Strike and that it is a generic term in the coin industry .

Volquez signed with the Rangers in 2001 under the name of Julio Reyes . He went by Edison Volquez after 2003 , before adding an ' ' n ' ' to his first name in 2007. # Early life # Volquez grew up in the Dominican Republic and started playing baseball when he was 9 or 10 with the support of his parents .

Together with John Danks and Thomas Diamond , Volquez was one third of the DVD trio of Rangers pitching prospects . After spending four years in the Rangers ' minor league system , Volquez made his major league debut on August 30 , 2005 in a start against the Chicago White Sox . He lost all three major league games he started that season , as well as one of the three games in which he appeared as a reliever , and posted a 14.21 ERA . He spent the first five months of the 2006 season at Triple-A Oklahoma until he was recalled to the majors in September . This time , he fared better , winning one of his eight starts and posting a 7.29 ERA . The Rangers were dissatisfied with the results shown by one of their top pitching prospects , so in 2007 they tried an unconventional tactic . Volquez was demoted to the Rangers ' A-league affiliate , the Bakersfield Blaze , to work on his control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the minor league system until he reached the big leagues in September . This tactic had been used by Mark Connor , the Rangers ' pitching coach , once before .

39514 Charles L. Gaines ( born c. 1942 ) is an American writer and outdoorsman , notable for his works on fly fishing , his role in the development of paintball , and his photo-essay ' ' Pumping Iron ' ' , about the bodybuilding culture of the 1970s , which was later adapted into a documentary film of the same name . # Early life # Gaines was born in Jacksonville , Florida in 1942 , the son of Charles Latham Gaines and Margaret ( Shook ) Gaines . At the age of ten , he and his family moved to Birmingham , Alabama . As a teenager , Gaines took up bodybuilding . He briefly attended Washington and Lee University but left school to travel around the country . He later received his BA from Birmingham-Southern College and his MFA in writing from the University of Iowa .

They landed at Anakena beach and his people spread out across the island , sub-divided it between clans claiming descent from his sons , and lived for more than a thousand years in their isolated island home at the southeastern tip of the Polynesian Triangle . # History # Polynesians first came to Rapa Nui ( also called Easter Island ) sometime between 300 CE and 800 CE . These are the common elements of oral history that have been extracted from island legends . Linguistic , DNA and Pollen analysis all point to a Polynesian first settlement of the island at that time , but it is unlikely that other details can be verified . During this era the Polynesians were colonising islands across a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' led his people from Hiva ; linguistic analysis comparing Rapanui to other Polynesian languages suggests this was the Marquesas Islands . # Legend # Hau-Maka had a dream in which his spirit traveled to a far country , to help look for new land for King ' ' Hotu Matu'a ' ' . He traveled to the ' ' Mata ki te rangi ' ' ( ' Eyes that look to the sky ) . The island has also been called Te pito o te henua , which means the Center of the Earth . Both islands are commonly said to be Easter Island . When Hau-Maka woke , he told the King . The King then ordered seven men to travel to the island from Hiva , their mythical home , to investigate . They found the land and returned to Hiva . The king himself then traveled to the new island . # Theories and controversy # # Tuu ko Iho # Resemblance of the name to an early Mangarevan founder god ' ' Atu Motua ' ' ( Father Lord ) has made some historians suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1860s , along with adopting the Mangarevan language . The real founder would have been ' ' Tuu ko Iho ' ' , who became just a supporting character in the Hotu Matua centric legends . # Dates of the first settlements # There is considerable uncertainty about the accuracy of this legend as well as the date of settlement . Published literature suggests the island was settled around 300-400 CE , or at about the time of the arrival of the earliest settlers in Hawaii . Some scientists say that Easter Island was not inhabited until 700-800 CE . This date range is based on glottochronological calculations and on three radiocarbon dates from charcoal that appears to have been produced during forest clearance activities , while a recent study , with radiocarbon dates from what is thought to be very early material , proves the island was settled by 1200 CE . This seems to be supported by the latest information on island 's deforestation that could have started around the same time . Any earlier human activity seems to be insignificant or low impact . # South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out many cultural similarities between Easter Island and South American Indian cultures which he suggested might have resulted from some settlers arriving also from the continent . According to local legends , a group of long-eared unknown men referred to as ' ' hanau eepe ' ' had arrived on the island sometime after Polynesians , introducing the stone carving technology and attempting to enslave the local Polynesians . Some early accounts of the legend place ' ' hanau epe ' ' as the original residents and Polynesians as later immigrants coming from Oparo . After mutual suspicions erupted in a violent clash , the ' ' hanau eepe ' ' were overthrown and exterminated , leaving only one survivor . The first description of island 's demographics by Jacob Roggeveen in 1722 still claimed that the population consisted of two distinctive ethnic groups , one being clearly Polynesian and the other white with so lengthened earlobes that they could tie them behind their necks . Roggeveen also noted how some of the islanders were generally large in stature . Islanders ' tallness was also witnessed by the Spanish who visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 199 cm . The fact that sweet potatoes , a staple of the Polynesian diet , and several other domestic plants - up to 12 in Easter Island - are of South American origin indicates that there may have been some contact between the two cultures . Either Polynesians have traveled to South America ' ' and ' ' back , or South American balsa rafts have drifted to Polynesia , possibly unable to make a return trip because of their less developed navigational skills and more fragile boats , or both . Polynesian connections in South America have been noticed among the Mapuche Indians in central and southern Chile . The Polynesian name for the small islet of Sala y Gmez ( ' ' Manu Motu Motiro Hiva ' ' , Bird 's islet on the way to a far away land ) ' ' east ' ' of Easter Island has also been seen as a hint that South America was known before European contacts . Further complicating the situation is that the word ' ' Hiva ' ' ( far away land ) was also the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eastern origin for the first inhabitants was unanimous among the islanders in all early accounts . Mainstream archeology is skeptical about any non-Polynesian influence on the island 's prehistory , although the discussion has become political . DNA sequence analysis of Easter Island 's current inhabitants ( a tool not available in Heyerdahl 's time ) offers strong evidence of Polynesian origins . However , since few islanders survived the 19th century slave raids , epidemics and deportations ( perhaps only 0.25% of the peak population ) , this evidence depends on how representative the survivors were of the general Rapanui population .

4 ' ' Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative , Inc. ' ' , 356 U.S. 525 ( 1958 ) , decided on May 19 , 1958 , was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that refined the doctrine regarding in what instances courts were required to follow state law . # Background of the case # Electric power utility company Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative , Inc. , the defendant in this case , provided electric power to subscribers in rural South Carolina . James Earl Byrd , the plaintiff , was employed by R. H. Bouligny , Inc. , an independent contractor . Bouligny had a $334,300 contract with Blue Ridge to construct 24 miles of new power lines , the reconversion to higher capacities of about 88 miles of existing lines , and the construction of two new substations and a breaker station . Byrd touched a live wire and suffered injuries while connecting power lines to one of the new substations . He brought a claim against his employer , Bouligny , and collected workmen 's compensation , his guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byrd then proceeded to bring an action in diversity against Blue Ridge in the District Court for the Western District of South Carolina . Byrd was a resident of the state of North Carolina and Blue Ridge was a South Carolina corporation . Byrd sought damages for injuries allegedly caused by Blue Ridge 's negligence . At issue was South Carolina 's Workmen 's Compensation Act that held that the employees of subcontractors are considered employees of the contractor for the purposes of the Act if , but only if , they perform work that is part of the contractor 's trade or business . Additionally , the local judicial interpretation of the Act held that it was a question of law , not fact whether a workman was an employee under the statute , thus to be decided by a judge , not a jury . Byrd argued that the work that Bouligny , Inc. was performing ( building electric substations ) was not part of Blue Ridge 's trade or business . At trial the judge entered judgment for Byrd ( agreeing with the plaintiff that substations are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the substations was purely internal , and trade or business required work for someone else ) . The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and directed judgment for Blue Ridge . The Supreme Court granted cert . # The Court 's decision # The question is whether the cause of action brought by the plaintiff is covered by the South Carolina Workmen 's Compensation Act and therefore whether the plaintiff is barred from any other remedy against his employer in connection with the events at issue in this case . The Court , in a majority opinion by Justice William Brennan , first discussed whether the issue should be decided by a jury or by a court , as is the practice ( and common law ) in South Carolina . The Court notes that while in South Carolina the court decided the question , the rule is not bound up with the definitions and rights of the parties , being purely a practical consideration with irrelevant historic causes , a custom . The Court then addressed the outcome determinative test of York . The Court reasoned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal court would have to follow state practice . However , in addition to the outcome-determinative test of York the federal courts should consider any countervailing federal policies . In this case , following the state practice would disrupt the federal system of allocating functions between judges and juries and go against the influence - if not the command - of the Seventh Amendment ( that guarantees the right of a trial by jury in suits at common law ) . Thus the Court found that the possibility of a different outcome was less important than perverting the judge-jury function allocations in the American federal system . Brennan concluded that there is no certainty or even a strong possibility that a different outcome would necessarily result if the issue is decided by a jury , mentioning numerous powers federal judges have ( including making judgments notwithstanding the verdict. ) # Analysis # There was considerable difficulty in applying the Byrd test . that stemmed from the fact that there is no scale to say with assurance in a particular case that the federal interest asserted is more or less important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state court . C. Wright &amp; M. Kane , The Law of Federal Courts . The Byrd opinion exhibits a confusion that exceeds even that normally surrounding a balancing test , and lower courts understandably experienced considerable difficulty in applying it . J.

His father was a department store buyer . Lerman began attending the Carnegie Institute of Technology before graduating from high school and received his BS in five semesters . As a graduate student with Linus Pauling at the California Institute of Technology , Lerman discovered that antibodies have two binding sites . Later , perhaps his most important discovery was that certain molecules bind to DNA by intercalation . This discovery has shaped much of science 's understanding about how drugs and mutagens interact with DNA . Later , during a sabbatical at the University of Cambridge , Lerman had a chance to work with later Nobel prize winners Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick . Lerman led a productive research program at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Albany . Lerman 's lab crew included at least one Nobel prize winner , Sidney Altman , and another , Tom Maniatis , who also became one of the leading molecular biologists of his time . Lerman 's last major effort , begun with Stuart Fischer at SUNY , was the invention of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis ( DGGE ) , a technique used to separate DNA molecules . DGGE is widely used by scientists who wish to ascertain biodiversity in microbial communities . Dr. Lerman was also a senior member of one of the first biotechnology companies , the Genetics Institute . Dr. Lerman was a member of the National Academy of Sciences , USA. # References #

4 The synaptotropic hypothesis , also called the synaptotrophic hypothesis , is a neurobiological hypothesis of neuronal growth and synapse formation . The hypothesis was first formulated by J.E . Vaughn in 1988 , and remains a focus of current research efforts . The synaptotropic hypothesis proposes that input from a presynaptic to a postsynaptic cell ( and maturation of excitatory synaptic inputs ) eventually can change the course of synapse formation at dendritic and axonal arbors . This synapse formation is required for the development of neuronal structure in the functioning brain . # Dendritic Arbor Development # # Growth # Dendrites of central nervous system neurons grow by addition and retraction of thin branches . This process is highly dynamic . Only a small fraction of newly added branches are actually maintained to become long-lasting components of the arbor . This process suggests that the branches sample the environment to detect the appropriate cells with which to form synapses . As a result , the hypothesis predicts that growth will be directed into regions containing more presynaptic elements . This morphology can be stabilized by creating microtubule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new synapses begins with initial contact between cells via cell-cell adhesion . This contact often occurs between either axonal or dendritic filopodia , which are highly dynamic and rarely stabilize . Next , the adhesive contact is converted to a nascent synapse , which contains glutamatergic NMDA receptors , but not AMPA receptors . However , the activation of NMDARs by glutamate can trigger the recruitment of AMPARs from the postsynaptic density . They also have a relatively high concentration of dense-core vesicles , which are thought to deliver structural proteins to the presynaptic site . # Synapse Maturation # Maturation of glutamatergic synapses involves changes in the amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission , as well as in the NMDAR subunit composition . Further , it includes the assembly of the postsynaptic density , which is a protein-dense region with both structural and signaling functions . Synaptic vesicles are also recruited , resulting in an increase in the reliability of synaptic transmission . # Neuronal Architecture # Although neurons generally follow a basic morphological pattern ( consisting of the tree-like dendritic arbor , a cell body , and an axonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique to every neuron and are central to understanding their complex neural function . The synaptotropic hypothesis implies that function drives form , since the appropriateness of new synapses is constantly being tested by the filopodia in the first stages of dendritogenesis , thus determining the form of the neural architecture . # Modifications of the Hypothesis # Some interpret the synaptotropic hypothesis as saying that manipulations that increase synapse formation and maturation promote formation of larger dendritic arbors , while treatments that reduce synapse maturation result in smaller arbors . However , the opposite result has been found in different manipulations of the molecular pathways underlying synaptogeneis . A resulting modified version of the hypothesis has emerged in which graded levels of synaptic maturation produce corresponding levels of stabilization . This is a different way of viewing the synaptotropic hypothesis that still takes into account the molecular mechanisms of dendritogenesis and synaptogenesis. # Supporting Evidence # The synaptotropic hypothesis would predict that cell adhesion molecules that are important in synapse formation would also greatly affect dendritic arbor growth . This has been shown to be the case with cadherins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptors are expressed in individual ' ' Xenopus ' ' neurons , trafficking of AMPA receptors to nascent synapses is minimized in those cells . These cells , like normal neurons , extend and retract dendritic branches . In the normal cell , some of these branches would form synapses , which is not the case in the neurons expressing the peptide . As a result , these cells have minimal dendritic arbors . This is because without AMPA receptors , the neuron ca n't cause neighboring neurons to fire action potentials , therefore disallowing their synapses to strengthen . As described previously , the pattern of dendritic branching depends on the initial contact of filopodia with afferent axons . The hypothesis predicts that regions with numerous prospective presynaptic terminals will attract more growing dendrites . Researchers have used the developing mouse spinal cord to test this hypothesis . A computer-assisted three-dimensional reconstruction system has been used with Golgi 's method preparations of mouse spinal cords . The relative dendritic lengths and densities at various zones in the spinal cord indicate that dendritic growth is initially primarily towards the marginal zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this biased distribution is lost as synapses form in the intermediate zone . This study is consistent with predictions of the synaptotropic hypothesis of dendritic branching . # Dissenting Evidence # Evidence against the synaptotropic hypothesis comes from experiments with munc 18 knock-out mice , mice engineered to be missing the Munc 18-1 protein , without which the mice never release neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles . Despite this , the mice develop normal brains before dying immediately after birth . # Imaging Techniques # # Dynamic Morphometrics # Dynamic morphometrics technology involves new methods of labeling , imaging , and quantifying dendritogenesis . The transparent , externally developing vertebrate embryos of ' ' Xenopus laevis ' ' and zebrafish allow direct imaging of the organism in the critical stages of development while keeping the embryos intact . Individual brain neurons can be fluorescently labeled using single cell electroporation while leaving the rest of the brain unaltered . Also , two-photon microscopy allows in vivo time-lapse imaging to create high-resolution , 3D images of neurons deep within the living brain , again with minimal damage to the brain . New computer software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods comprise a new type of imaging technology that can monitor the process of dendritogenesis and can help give evidence to either dissent with or support the synaptotropic hypothesis . # Applications # Dynamic morphometrics and other imaging techniques have been used to observe both dendrite growth and synaptogenesistwo processes between which the relationship is not well understood . Non-spiny dendritic arbors expressing a fluorescent postsynaptic marker protein were imaged as they arborized ( in the zebrafish larvae ) , and this confirmed the role of newly extended dendritic filopodia in synaptogenesis , their maturation into dendritic branches , and the result , namely , growth and branching of the dendritic arbor . These findings support the model wherein synapse formation can direct dendrite arborization , a basic tenet of the synaptotropic hypothesis . 
4 Route 150 is a state highway in southern Connecticut running for 9.04 mi from the village of Northford , in the town of North Branford , through the center of Wallingford , to the village of Yalesville in Wallingford . # Route description # Route 150 begins at an intersection with Route 22 in North Branford and heads northwest into Wallingford . In Wallingford , it heads north , intersecting I-91 . It then continues north and northwest , briefly overlapping US 5 in central Wallingford . It continues to cross the Quinnipiac River and intersect Route 15 . Route 150 then turns north-northeast along the river , crossing it again , before overlapping Route 71 through the one-lane Yalesville Underpass . It then leaves Route 71 before ending at another intersection with US 5. # History # The road from Wallingford center to the village of Northford was known as State Highway 226 in the 1920s . Route 150 was commissioned in 1932 partly from the western half of old Highway 226 , running east&amp;ndash ; west from Cheshire to McKenzie Reservoir in eastern Wallingford along Wallingford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961 , the rest of old Highway 226 was incorporated into Route 150 , continuing south of East Wallingford along Northford Road to Route 17 in Northford . The following year , however , the section of Route 150 east of the current intersection with East Center Street ( modern SR 738 ) was shifted to the current route along Woodhouse Avenue , with the southern terminus set at Route 17 in Northford . The Yalesville Underpass , built in 1838 and believed to be the oldest skew arch underpass in North America , was incorporated into Route 150 also in 1962 , when the route was extended to its current northern terminus via a section of the old Hartford and New Haven Turnpike ( former SR 555 ) . In 1963 , the southern terminus was shifted slightly to its current location at Route 22 with the section beyond the current terminus transferred to Route 22. # Junction list # CTint CTint CTint CTint CTint CTint 
0514 Meru North District was one of the unconstitutionally created districts of Kenya , located in that country 's Eastern Province . In 1992 , it was split from the large Meru District , along with Meru Central District , Meru South District ( Nithi ) , and Tharaka District . Since the Supreme Court 's decision in September 2009 , Meru North is again part of Meru County . The area of Meru North District is the home of the Ameru ( Meru ) tribe , which is sometimes described as being related to other tribes living around the Mount Kenya region : the Kikuyu and the Embu people . The Ameru are generally called Bantu people who have been native to the Mt . Kenya area for many , many years -- well before colonization of Kenya by Great Britain in the 19th Century . The people are now predominantly Christian -- Methodist , Presbyterian , Roman Catholic , and other denominations , reflecting the work of missionaries -- with also minorities of Indian descent , who are mainly Hindus , and African/Arab descent , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British in ancestry . Meru is well known for its production of khat , known locally as ' ' miraa ' ' , and its supply to the rest of the country 's major towns . Because of the rich soils in the area , this plant thrives and most of the residents benefit from its sale . Trading in this commodity is a boon to other vendors , for example it stimulates the sale of banana leaves to ' ' miraa ' ' traders to protect the khat harvest from drying . The district headquarters was in the town of Maua . There were four constituencies in the district : *Igembe South Constituency *Igembe North Constituency *Tigania East Constituency *Tigania West Constituency

8514 Gao Cheng ( ) ( 521549 ) , courtesy name Zihui ( ) , formally Prince Wenxiang of Bohai ( ) , later further posthumously honored by Northern Qi as Emperor Wenxiang ( ) with the temple name Shizong ( ) , was the paramount official of the Chinese/Xianbei state Eastern Wei , a branch successor state of Northern Wei . He was Gao Huan 's oldest son , and because his father wielded actual power during Emperor Xiaojing 's reign , Gao Cheng also received increasingly great authority , and after his father 's death in 547 took over the rein of the state . He was considered capable but frivolous and arrogant , as well as lacking in sexual discretion . In 549 , he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing ( ) , and his younger brother Gao Yang took over the control over the Eastern Wei regime . # Background # Gao Cheng was born in 521 , when his father Gao Huan was still a courier of documents between the Northern Wei capital Luoyang and the old capital Pingcheng ( , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from a wealthy family , but Gao Huan 's own household was poor . In 525 , the ambitious Gao Huan joined the agrarian rebellion led by Du Luozhou ( ) , but subsequently became convinced that Du was not a successful leader , and sought to flee from Du 's camp with his associates Wei Jing ( ) , Duan Rong ( ) , and Cai Jun ( ) . ( Wei and Duan were also his brothers-in-law . ) Lady Lou and her children ( Gao Cheng and a daughter ) fled as well , riding a cow . During this flight , Gao Cheng repeatedly fell off the cow , and Gao Huan considered killing him with an arrow , but Duan repeatedly saved him . The next known incident involving Gao Cheng was in 531 , when Gao , then a Northern Wei general , rebelled against the members of Erzhu Rong 's clan ( who had dominated the political scene after they defeated Emperor Xiaozhuang in revenge of Emperor Xiaozhuang 's killing of Erzhu Rong ) , and when an agrarian rebel leader , Gao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huan 's , refused to follow Gao Huan , Gao Huan sent Gao Cheng to visit Gao Aocao and showing respect due a granduncle , persuading Gao Aocao of Gao Huan 's sincerity . # During Gao Huan 's lifetime # Gao Huan defeated the Erzhus in 532 and entered Luoyang victoriously , and he made Yuan Xiu the Prince of Pingyang emperor ( as Emperor Xiaowu ) . As a result of Gao Huan 's victory , the 11-year-old Gao Cheng received high ranking titles , even though he appeared to carry no actual responsibility by this point in either the imperial administration or his father 's army . With his father having been created the Prince of Bohai , Gao Cheng , as his oldest son , also carried the title the Heir Apparent of Bohai . In 534 , Emperor Xiaowu , in a dispute with Gao Huan over the control of power , fled to the domain of the independent general Yuwen Tai , leading to a split of Northern Wei , as Gao Huan then made Yuan Shanjian the Heir Apparent of Qinghe emperor ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's control became known as Eastern Wei , and the areas under Yuwen 's control became known as Western Wei . Gao Huan moved the Eastern Wei capital from Luoyang to Yecheng . In 535 , Gao Huan found out that Gao Cheng had been conducting an affair with Gao Huan 's concubine Lady Zheng Dache ( ) . In anger , he caned Gao Cheng 100 times and put him under arrest , and he seriously considered making Gao You ( ) , his son by his concubine Lady Erzhu Ying'e ( Erzhu Rong 's daughter ) heir apparent to replace Gao Cheng . Gao Cheng sought help from Gao Huan 's friend Sima Ziru ( ) , who persuaded Gao Huan to change his mind by reminding him the contributions that Gao Cheng 's mother Princess Lou had made , and also subsequently by forcing the witnesses to the affair between Gao Cheng and Lady Zheng to recant . Still , Princess Lou and Gao Cheng were forced to repeatedly bow and crawl on the ground to beg Gao Huan 's forgiveness , and Gao Huan allowed Gao Cheng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gao Cheng , who was then with his father at his military headquarters of Jinyang , requested permission to become in charge of the Eastern Wei imperial government at Yecheng . Gao Huan initially refused , but Gao Huan 's assistant Sun Qian ( ) spoke on Gao Cheng 's behalf , and finally Gao Huan agreed . Gao Cheng soon arrived at Yecheng and took over the imperial administration . He became known as a harsh but capable enforcer of laws , in comparison to his father 's policy of relaxed enforcement . He also abolished the seniority-based system of promotion that had caused the imperial administration to stagnate , seeking out capable individuals and promoting them quickly . Around this time , Gao Cheng also married Emperor Xiaojing 's sister the Princess Fengyi as his wife . In 540 , she bore him a son , Gao Xiaowan ( ) . The emperor personally went to his mansion to congratulate him , and the officials all sent expensive gifts . ( Gao Cheng initially declined , stating that Gao Xiaocheng was the emperor 's nephew , and therefore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) In 543 , the actions of Gao Cheng and his trusted assistant , Cui Xian ( ) , would lead to the rebellion of the general Gao Zhongmi ( ) . Gao Zhongmi had earlier married Cui 's sister as his wife , but later abandoned her , and this led to hatred between Gao Zhongmi and Cui . Cui therefore found many reasons to pick fault with selections of officials that Gao Zhongmi had made , and Gao Cheng agreed with Cui . Further , on one occasion , when Gao Cheng saw Gao Zhongmi 's new wife Li Changyi ( ) , he was stunned by her beauty and tried to rape her . Lady Li escaped , and informed Gao Zhongmi about the incident . Therefore , when Gao Zhongmi became the governor of Northern Yu Province ( , roughly modern Zhengzhou , Henan ) , he surrendered the capital of Northern Yu Province , the key garrison Hulao ( ) , to Western Wei . ( Gao Huan , blaming Cui for Gao Zhongmi 's rebellion , initially wanted to kill Cui or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaying the influence that he had on his father by this point , was able to persuade Gao Huan , through Gao Huan 's assistant Chen Yuanda ( ) , that punishing Cui would undermine Gao Cheng 's authority , and therefore Gao Huan never did punish Cui . ) In the ensuing battles over the control of the Hulao and Luoyang region , both Yuwen Tai and Gao Huan nearly died . After Eastern Wei forces finally captured Hulao later that year , and Lady Li was delivered to Yecheng , Gao Cheng made her one of his concubines . In 544 , Gao Huan , believing that the officials Sima Ziru , Sun Teng ( ) , Gao Yue ( , Gao Huan 's cousin ) , and Gao Longzhi ( ) , were becoming too powerful and too corrupt , transferred major portions of those officials ' responsibilities to Gao Cheng . Gao Cheng further showed off his authority by acting imperiously toward those officials . For example , when Sun once visited him and showed insufficient respect , he had his guards throw Sun on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed his assistant Cui Jishu ( , Cui Xian 's uncle ) as Emperor Xiaojing 's secretary , to keep watch on Emperor Xiaojing . Later in 544 , Gao Cheng , wanting to stamp out corruption within the imperial administration , empowered Cui Xian and Song Youdao ( ) to investigate high level officials for corruption . Cui and Song each made several accusations against high level officials , and Gao Cheng had , in particular , Sima Ziru stripped of all titles and offices , and Yuan Tan ( ) the Prince of Xianyang stripped of his offices . In order to show that Cui , in particular , was empowered to carry out investigations , Gao Cheng had Cui intentionally show disrespect to himself in public with impunity , so that the officials would be even more apprehensive of Cui . In late 546 , Gao Huan became seriously ill , and he summoned Gao Cheng back to Jinyang to entrust the matters to him . At that time , Gao Cheng was apprehensive that the general Hou Jing , who commanded the provinces south of the Yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of officials that he could trust , and specifically instructed him to make Murong Shaozong ( ) the commander of the army against Hou if Hou rebelled . Gao Huan died in spring 547 , but Gao Cheng , also pursuant to Gao Huan 's instructions , did not announce Gao Huan 's death in public ; rather , he returned to Yecheng , pretending that Gao Huan was still alive . # As regent # Also in spring 547 , Hou Jing , unsure whether Gao Huan was still alive but believing that Gao Huan had died , rebelled , first surrendering the 13 provinces he commanded to Western Wei , and then to Liang Dynasty . Gao Cheng initially sent Han Gui ( ) against Hou , and Han had some successes against Hou 's forces , but was forced to withdraw when Western Wei forces arrived , taking four of Hou 's provinces in exchange for supporting Hou . Subsequently , Hou broke with Western Wei , and Western Wei forces withdrew . Meanwhile , Emperor Wu of Liang commissioned his nephew Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gao Cheng , after finally revealing Gao Huan 's death , put Murong Shaozong in charge of the army . He also made peace overtures to Hou , promising to keep him in command of the southern provinces if he would submit . Hou refused . Meanwhile , Gao Cheng also had a threat from within . Gao Cheng , once Gao Huan died , began to show contempt for Emperor Xiaojing , and once , when Emperor Xiaojing rebuked him for public disrespect , Gao Cheng ordered Cui Jishu to punch Emperor Xiaojing three times . Emperor Xiaojing , fearful of what might come next , formed a conspiracy against Gao Cheng . In winter 547 , the plot was discovered , and Gao Cheng put the emperor under arrest and executed his coconspirators . Late in 547 , Murong Shaozong crushed Xiao Yuanming 's army at Hanshan ( , in modern Xuzhou , Jiangsu ) , capturing Xiao Yuanming . When Xiao Yuanming was delivered to Gao Cheng , Gao Cheng treatedly him with respect , intending to try to use Xiao Yuanming as a pawn against Hou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's army as well , and Hou fled to Liang , seizing the Liang border city of Shouyang ( , in modern Lu'an , Anhui ) as his base of operations . Gao Cheng then began negotiating peace with Liang 's Emperor Wu , intending to create instability in the relationship between Emperor Wu and Hou . Hou , eventually coming to believe that Emperor Wu would betray him and turn him over to Eastern Wu to exchange for Xiao Yuanming , rebelled in fall 548 , eventually capturing the Liang capital Jiankang and holding Emperor Wu and then his successor Emperor Jianwen of Liang as puppets . Once Hou did so , he made an overture of peace to Gao Cheng , but Gao Cheng did not respond . Meanwhile , Gao Cheng was trying to recapture the provinces that Western Wei had taken from Hou . Also in 548 , he sent Gao Yue and Murong Shaozong to siege Changshe ( , in modern Xuchang , Henan ) , but Changshe , defended by the Western Wei general Wang Sizheng ( ) , would not fall easily , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill Murong Shaozong and another major general , Liu Fengsheng ( ) . In summer 549 , Gao Cheng himself commanded reinforcements and arrived at Changshe . He intensified the siege , and soon , Changshe fell , and he captured Wang , whom he treated with respect . After Changshe fell , Western Wei forces also withdrew from the three other provinces that they had captured , and Eastern Wei by this time had recaptured all of the land that Hou had initially taken . # Death # Meanwhile , Gao Cheng was beginning to confer with his associates on how he could seize the throne . In fall 549 , he was in a meeting with Chen Yuankang , Cui Jishu , and Yang Yin , discussing the procedure for doing so . One of the attending servants was Lan Jing ( ) , a son of the Liang general Lan Qin ( ) , whom he had captured in battle and had repeatedly refused to release despite both Lan Qin 's and Lan Jing 's pleas to allow Lan Qin to ransom his son . During the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others at the meeting . When Lan Jing stepped out , Gao Cheng made the comment , Last night , I dreamed that this slave was using a sword to hit me .

4 Greeks Bearing Gifts is an episode of the British science fiction television series ' ' Torchwood ' ' . It is the seventh episode of the first series , which was broadcast on 26 November 2006. # Plot # The Torchwood team is called to a building site where a human skeleton and a rusted alien artifact have been discovered in the ground . Owen initially identifies the skeleton as a woman who died from a gunshot , having been buried for nearly two centuries . They return to the Hub , where Owen and Gwen flirt incessantly , infuriating Tosh . She leaves for a local bar , where she meets Mary , who claims to know about Torchwood and calls herself a Scavenger of alien artifacts . Mary gives Tosh a pendant that allows her to read minds ; Tosh is initially overwhelmed by all the collected thoughts at the bar , but Mary has Tosh focus only on her thoughts , revealing romantic intentions . Tosh accepts the gift , and promises to not tell Torchwood from whom she got the gift . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is able to read Owen and Gwen 's mind , both having dismissive and contemptuous thoughts about Tosh . She races home , only to find Mary there ; Tosh attempts to return the pendant but Mary insists it can be used for good . Mary convinces Tosh to read her mind again , reveals romantic intentions for Tosh . The two spend the night together . The next day , Tosh asks Mary her true identity but she remains coy , answering Philoctetes . Tosh wears the pendant in a crowded street , and though overwhelmed with the thoughts of everyone , identifies one man preparing to commit murder , and she is able to identify and stop him . Tosh returns to the Hub where Owen reveals he had misidentified the skeleton , and now knows it to be a man that died of an unidentified trauma . Tosh speaks to Jack about the name Philoctetes , which Jack recognizes as a reference to Greek mythology ; Philoctetes was an archer who was exiled on the island of Lemnos during the Trojan War . Tosh returns to Mary later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeleton . When Tosh is unable to provide her any answers , Mary convinces Tosh to ask the others at the Hub , using the pendant as they may be hiding information from her . Tosh finds Owen lacks any information on the artifact , while she is unable to read Jack 's mind . Meanwhile , Owen has discovered that the same trauma that inflicted the skeleton has been reported several times in the last few centuries , while Jack becomes aware of Tosh 's strange behavior . When Tosh returns to Mary , she reveals herself as an alien , an exiled dissident , and that the artifact is a transporter that can help her to leave the planet . Tosh offers Torchwood 's services to Mary , but she refuses , and instead asks Tosh to take her to Torchwood so she can retrieve the artifact herself . At the Hub , they find that Jack has deduced that Mary is an alien and the murderer of the skeleton and others through the century . Jack explains that the artifact is a transporter for a guard and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1812 , Mary was able to kill her guard and took the body of a human woman , killing others to keep her human form . Mary holds Tosh at knife point , demanding the artifact . Jack , now aware of Tosh 's telepathic abilities , instruct Tosh to remain still as he makes the trade with Mary . As soon as Mary takes the artifact , she and it disappear ; Jack explains he programmed the device to transport her directly to the center of the sun . Owen and Gwen apologize to Tosh for their behavior to her . Jack offers Tosh the pendant for herself , but she smashes it underfoot . Tosh tells Jack in private that attempting to read his mind produced only silence , like that of a dead man . # Continuity # * The officer is killed in 1812 ( per caption ) , and Toshiko calculates his skeleton has been there for 196 years , 11 to 11 1/2 months , placing the episode in 2009 with the concurrent ' ' Doctor Who ' ' timeline . This is in potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cardiff in 1941 and says he has made the city his home for sixty-six years ( he also explained that he was taken out to the countryside upon arrival in 1941 , so the 66 years ' ' could ' ' be counted from his subsequent return to the city ) . * A pair of 3-D glasses , originally used by the Tenth Doctor in Doomsday and seen in Small Worlds , makes another fleeting appearance . Also visible is a rifle used against the Daleks in Doomsday , and a replica of the Doctor 's sonic screwdriver can be seen on Toshiko 's desk . The Sycorax Leader 's staff and sword from ' ' Doctor Who ' ' episode The Christmas Invasion are visible next to the Doomsday Rifle . Presumably the sword was retrieved with the severed hand of the Doctor or from The Sycorax Leader with the staff . * A man of questionable mental state is said to be having visions of Cybermen. * Jack has asked Toshiko to prepare a list for UNIT , the first verbal mention of that organisation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack explains that UNIT wants Torchwood to handle a certain alien problem , and Jack wants Tosh to draw up a list of reasons why they can't. * Jack speaks to the Prime Minister on the telephone asking why documents listing Torchwood operations are being given to the opposition , believed to be Harold Saxon ( i.e. , the Master ) . This may explain how the Master knows about Jack in the ' ' Doctor Who ' ' episode The Sound of Drums , and how the Master is able to send the rest of the Torchwood team on what he describes as a wild goose chase in the same episode . * Some scan images of the Cyberwoman are in the autopsy room where the body they find is being held . * Toshiko now knows about the affair between Gwen and Owen , first seen at the end of Countrycide . * An alien of the same race as Mary appears in ' ' The Sarah Jane Adventures ' ' pilot episode Invasion of the Bane , albeit this time as a star poet . The episode clarifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are largely a peaceful race . Although this particular species has been referenced in the Torchwood novel ' ' Something in the Water ' ' as Arcateenians , the Sarah Jane website originally referred to this alien species as the Butterfly People . * Mary recites Toshiko 's biographical summary to her , stating that Toshiko was born in London in July 1975 , and that her grandfather had worked at Bletchley Park . Toshiko 's personnel record , shown in Exit Wounds , records her birth date as 18 September 1981 . Toshiko 's grandfather , a Japanese man , being able to work at Bletchley Park is inconsistent with both reality and her paranoia about being captured when transported to 1941 in Captain Jack Harkness . # Music # *The songs Spitting Games by Snow Patrol ( when Mary introduces herself to Toshiko , last heard in Everything Changes ) , Sing by Travis ( when Tosh tells Mary about alien cultures &amp; artefacts , last heard in Ghost Machine ) , Drag by Placebo ( when Mary tells Tosh about the pendant and tells her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( when Mary kisses Tosh in the cafe then asks about the object from the building site ) are featured in this episode . # Outside references # * The phrase Beware Greeks bearing gifts refers to the Trojan horse described in Virgil 's The Aeneid. * James Bond and the film ' ' Alien ' ' are referenced. * Jack makes a reference to the American television series ' ' Quincy , M.E. ' ' when Owen is first examining the skeleton at the building site ( Good job , Quincy ) . * Mary quotes the poem ' ' Kubla Khan ' ' by Samuel Taylor Coleridge . The historical Kublai Khan appeared in the First Doctor serial ' ' Marco Polo ' ' ( 1964 ) . * The overheard thought Six cigarettes today and all of them post-coital .. glorious . is a quote from ' ' Bridget Jones 's Diary ' ' . * When Tosh enters the autopsy room , Gwen sings a part of Dem Bones to Owen ( The leg bone 's connected to the .. hip bone ) after his prediction about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proven entirely false ( it is a male with unknown chest trauma , with only GSW ruled out ) . * Gwen teases Owen by calling him Amanda Burton , in reference to that actress 's role as a pathologist in the BBC drama series ' ' Silent Witness ' ' . She also imitates the sound played when contestants give an incorrect answer in the game show ' ' Family Fortunes ' ' . * There are at least five versions of the story of Philoctetes

4 The Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia ( ; also Statute of Sau , ' ' Estatut de Sau ' ' , after the location where the statute was first made ) is a constitutional law defining the region of Catalonia as an autonomous community within the Kingdom of Spain . It was promulgated on 18 September 1979 . It is one of seventeen such statutes granted , in various forms and capabilities , to the different autonomous communities of Spain since the Spanish transition to democracy of the 1970s . On June 18 , 2006 , a referendum altering the statute to expand the authority of the Catalan government was approved in a referendum , and became effective as of August 9 , 2006 . Catalonia first obtained a Statute of Autonomy in 1932 , during the Second Spanish Republic . This law was abolished by General Francisco Franco after the Spanish Civil War , largely because Catalonia had been a region opposed to the Nationalist forces , and during his rule Catalan culture , language , and self-rule were harshly suppressed . # Self-government under the statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self-government of Catalonia is politically organised .

4 Michael Thonet ( 2 July 1796 -- 3 March 1871 ) was a German-Austrian cabinet maker . Thonet was the son of master tanner Franz Anton Thonet of Boppard . Following a carpenter 's apprenticeship , Thonet set himself up as an independent cabinetmaker in 1819 . A year later , he married Anna Grahs , with whom he had seven sons and six daughters . Only five of the sons , however , survived early childhood . In the 1830s , Thonet began trying to make furniture out of glued and bent wooden slats . His first success was the ' ' Bopparder Schichtholzstuhl ' ' ( Boppard layerwood chair ) in 1836 . Thonet gained substantial independence by acquiring the ' ' Michelsmhle ' ' , the glue factory that made the glue for this process , in 1837 . However , his attempts to patent the technology failed in Germany ( 1840 ) as well as in Great Britain , France and Russia ( 1841 ) . Thonet 's essential breakthrough was his success in having light , strong wood bent into curved , graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled him to design entirely novel , elegant , lightweight , durable and comfortable furniture , which appealed strongly to fashion - a complete departure from the heavy , carved designs of the past - and whose aesthetic and functional appeal remains to this day . At the Koblenz trade fair of 1841 , Thonet met Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich , who was enthusiastic about Thonet 's furniture and invited him to the Vienna court . In the next year , Thonet was able to present his furniture , and his chairs in particular , to the Imperial Family . As the Boppard establishment got into financial difficulties , Thonet sold it and emigrated to Vienna with his family . There , he worked with his sons on the interior decoration of the Palais Liechtenstein for the Carl Leistler establishment . In 1849 he again founded an establishment of his own , the ' ' Gebrder Thonet ' ' . In 1850 he produced his ' ' Nr 1 ' ' chair . The World 's Fair in London 1851 saw him receive the bronze medal for his ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakthrough . At the next World 's Fair in Paris 1855 , he was awarded the silver medal as he continued to improve his production methods . In 1856 he was able to open up a new factory in Koryany , Moravia . Its extensive beech woods were of great significance to his enterprise . The 1859 chair ' ' Nr. 14 ' ' - better known as ' ' Konsumstuhl Nr. 14 ' ' , coffee shop chair no. 14 - is still called the chair of chairs with some 50 million produced up until 1930 . It yielded a gold medal for Thonet 's enterprise at the 1867 Paris World 's Fair . As Michael Thonet died 1871 in Vienna , the ' ' Fa . Gebrder Thonet ' ' had sales locations across Europe as well as Chicago and New York . Today , a museum in the factory in Frankenberg , Hesse showcases the firm 's history and the Thonet design .

4 East Timor Women Australia ( ETWA ) is a grassroots non-government organisation established to support women in East Timor . # East Timorese Tais # A key focus of support is in assisting women 's sustainable livelihoods in the handcrafts industry . ETWA partners with local organisations the Taibesi Cooperative and Cooperativa Tais Timor ( CTT ) . These organisations source tais , the traditional East Timorese weavings , from rural and urban weaving groups . The weaving of tais requires a great deal of skill with designs having a deeply embedded cultural meaning . Designs are passed down from mother to daughter with great variation across the country . Tais are woven on back-strap looms where a harness sits on the lower back providing tension . Traditionally tais were made from locally sourced and spun cotton although many weavers have incorporated imported cotton into their designs . Many East Timorese organisations such as CTT and Taibesi are also incorporating tais into other product design in order to access broader markets for their products . ETWA supports the handcrafts industry as a mechanism which allows women to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of domestic violence in East Timor economic empowerment may be one way to further strengthen women 's social role and opportunities . It also allows the many women widowed or orphaned under the Indonesian occupation with a means of supporting themselves while recognising their highly specialised skills and expertise . # The Organisation # ETWA is a member-based organisation that is run by volunteers with support by a part-time coordinator . It was established in 2004 by a group of community development students , some of whom were active in the Free East Timor movement before the 1999 referendum . As well as its Melbourne based office ETWA also has chapters active in the Dandenong Ranges , Gippsland and the Northern Territory . The organisation is self-funded by membership fees , donations and fundraising activities . # Activities # In addition to supporting CTT and the Taibesi Cooperative to find markets overseas ETWA undertakes other activities .

4 runtime = 32 minutes ' ' Aftermath ' ' is a 1994 Spanish horror short film written and directed by Nacho Cerd . Containing no spoken dialogue , ' ' Aftermath ' ' is the second installment in a trilogy of shorts by Cerd , preceded by 1990 's ' ' The Awakening ' ' , and followed by 1998 's ' ' Genesis ' ' . # Plot # A woman named Marta Arnau Marti dies in a car crash , after accidentally running over a dog . An orderly wheels Marta 's body into a morgue drawer , past a mourning couple , who a nurse gives a crucifix necklace . The orderly overhears two workers autopsying a pair of male bodies , looks in on them out of curiosity , and leaves when one of the morticians ( who is disturbingly enthused by his duties ) glares at him . The morticians complete their work on the dead men , and while one leaves , the other remains , and brings in Marta 's body . Aroused by Marta , the mortician locks himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brain , and caresses it with a knife , which he uses to mutilate Marta 's vagina , and cut open her torso . The mortician masturbates to orgasm while fondling Marta 's breasts and innards , then takes photographs of his handiwork . Unable to contain his lust any longer , the mortician engages in necrophilia , after setting his camera on automatic to record the event . Afterward , the mortician autopsies Marta , cleans up , and leaves . In his home , the pajama-clad mortician blends Marta 's stolen heart into a pulp , which he gives to his dog before proceeding to relax in his sitting room . As a baby 's cries emanate from the television , the scraps of newspaper the dog is eating the heart off of are shown to contain Marta 's obituary . # Cast # * Pep Tosar as Forense * Jordi Tarrida as Mdico #2 * ngel Tarris as Celador * Xevi Collellmir as Cadver Vin # Reception # Dread Central wrote , It is intense . It is unflinching . Yet , at its core it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in detail and composition as any other great film has ever been , while The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre stated that ' ' Aftermath ' ' is a beautifully shot sick movie with an ending that is as subtle as it is thought-provoking and raises this whole sickening work into the single most gut-wrenching and extreme expression of irony ever made . DVD Talk awarded four and a half out of five stars and wrote , The necrophilia in this movie is very disturbing . It is not just carnal ; it is filled with volatility and extreme violence . While nothing is shown outright , the implication is repellent enough . Indeed , one could argue that Cerd is making a larger point about defying death . But it 's a hard sell . Treating the departed as nothing more than a plaything for the fulfillment of one 's most twisted desires almost erases any grander theme . While the ending is quite unnerving , the rest of ' ' Aftermath ' ' is an equally uneasy ordeal . You may see nothing more in it than fetishism gone foul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloody Disgusting rated it four and half out of five stars and wrote , Aftermath , is definitely one of the most controversial films of the last couple of decades . Its ruthless and realistic depiction of grisly autopsies and a sinister surgeon with an inclination towards violent necrophilia has some of the hardest scenes to stomach in any horror movie , period . # Awards # ' ' Aftermath ' ' won in the category Best Short Film at the 1997 Fantasia Festival . # References # 
4 Etel Adnan ( born 24 February 1925 in Beirut , Lebanon ) is a Lebanese-American poet , essayist , and visual artist . In 2003 ' ' MELUS ' ' , the journal of the Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States , called Adnan arguably the most celebrated and accomplished Arab American author writing today . She currently lives between Paris , France and Sausalito , California . # Life # Etel Adnan was born in 1925 in Beirut , Lebanon . Adnan 's mother was a Christian Greek from Smyrna and her father was Muslim Syrian and a petty officer . Though she grew up speaking Greek and Turkish in a primarily Arabic-speaking society , she was educated at French convent schools and French became the language in which her early work was first written . She also studied English in her youth , and most of her later work has been first written in this language . At twenty-four Adnan traveled to Paris where she received a degree in philosophy from the Sorbonne . She then traveled to America where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berkeley and at Harvard University . From 1952 to 1978 , she taught philosophy of art at the Dominican University of California in San Rafael . She has also lectured at many universities throughout the United States . Adnan returned from America to Lebanon and worked as a journalist and cultural editor for ' ' Al-Safa ' ' , a French-language newspaper in Beirut , Lebanon . In addition , she also helped build the cultural section of the newspaper , occasionally contributing cartoons and illustrations . Her tenure at Al-Safa was most notable for her front-page editorials , commenting on the important political issues of the day . Caught between languages , in her youth Adnan first found her voice through painting rather than writing . ' ' MELUS ' ' calls Adnan 's life a study in displacement and alienation . In 1996 she recalled , Abstract art was the equivalent of poetic expression ; I did n't need to use words , but colors and lines . I did n't need to belong to a language-oriented culture but to an open form of expression . She has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ArabAmerican can not be confined to his or her fellow Arabs . Books have a life of their own and no one can determine their fate . The only thing we can strive for consciously is to be aware of the existence of a growing body of ArabAmerican literature , try to know it and make it known . In her later years Adnan began to openly identify as lesbian. # Written Works # # In English # * ' ' Sitt Marie Rose : A Novel ' ' ( 1978 ) **6;168959;br Written in French , the novel was translated into English in 1982 .

4 : ' ' Another Henry Hubbard was a New Hampshire politician . See Henry Hubbard . ' ' Henry Vincent Hubbard ( 1875 &amp;ndash ; 1947 ) was an American landscape architect and planner , famous for his unique teaching styles at Harvard University , and his many publications . He was one of the prime supporters for a national system of public parks . # Life and career # Hubbard was taught by Frederick Law Olmsted , Jr . at Harvard University . He was the first person to earn a degree in landscape architecture . He later joined the Olmsted Brothers Firm in Brookline , Massachusetts . While working for their firm , Hubbard went back to Harvard in 1906 to teach landscape architecture . During his thirty-three years of teaching , he focused on developing the profession of landscape architecture along with regional and city planning . Hubbard used real design problems in his classes , unlike the other professors . He also started a separate school in Harvard for city planning in 1929 . In 1917 , Hubbard wrote one of his own textbooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Design ' ' . Co-authored by Theodora Kimball ( his wife and colleague ) , this book became the standard text for landscape architecture for many years . It was considered the bible at Harvard for landscape architecture students . In his book , Hubbard divides the history of landscape architecture into humanized ( formal ) and naturalized ( informal ) styles . It also discusses the changes in European precedents and the use of classical formulae , and emphasizes that modern design is based on a typological and pictorial approach , called the Beaux Arts approach . Many landscape designers started to view this approach as confining and sometimes oblivious to the conditions of society and spatial context . One of Hubbard 's main influences was the German prince Hermann von Pckler-Muskau , and his estate of Muskau . In ' ' An Introduction to the Study of Landscape Design ' ' , Hubbard states that Pckler is important not only because of his extensive amount of work as a designer , but also because of his considerable amount of ideological writing on the topic of landscape design . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to later generations of American landscape architects . Hubbard was a member of the American Society of Landscape Architects . In 1910 , he founded and became the chief editor of their magazine , ' ' Landscape Architecture ' ' He also founded and became the chief editor of another magazine , ' ' City Planning Quarterly ' ' , in 1925 . Hubbard became the president of the ASLA from 1931 to 1935 . He spent twenty years as a planning consultant for the National Park Service , the Federal Housing Authority , and several cities . Hubbard was also an active member of the National Capitol Park and Planning Commission , the President 's Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership , and the American Academy in Rome . # The Book , ' ' An Introduction to the Study of Landscape Design ' ' # In this book , the Hubbards teach people how to completely understand the landscape design styles .

In addition to that , the authors generalized about three factors of development of individual styles which are their surroundings , designers characters and usages . Those lead the directions and reveal on their designs . Moreover , a strong individual style gives people an impressive image and usually becomes the core of that era . The Hubbards discussed the various styles of landscape design in this book . The Moorish style in Spainthe gardens are filled with fruit trees , flowers and water features and encircled by buildings which protect people from outside . The vegetation makes shadows and water can cool the temperature down . Those are necessary for the hot and dry weather in the Moorish gardens . The garden of the Alhambra and the Generaliffe at Granada are the examples of the Moorish style in Spain .

In 17th century of Europe , the style of Le Ntre led a new stream and was imitated by many countries . For example , Versailles . The Romantic landscape style this style is not as formal as the formers been discussed and uses less geometrical shapes and axes . The design shows a simple and natural form . The English cottage style this style is much different than others . No beautiful decoration , grand buildings and ornate water fountains , instead of those were small gardens , low buildings and natural environment .

4 St. Augustine 's College was an Australian Roman Catholic secondary college in Yarraville , Victoria . It was opened in 1942 , and manned and run by the Congregation of Christian Brothers . The school was particularly recognised in the city of Melbourne for the strength of its sporting teams , and the sportsmen it produced . For example , six members of the 1954 VFL premiership team ( the Footscray Bulldogs ) were old boys of St. Augustine 's , including Doug Reynolds and Ted Whitten . The school was closed in 1972 , later to be reopened as St. Augustines Primary school . Following the withdrawal of the Christian Brothers , the Avoca Street Campus was taken over by the Sisters of St Joseph who proceeded to operate the site as an extension of their Altona West school , Mount St Joseph 's .

Each committee has 12 matching subcommittees , each of which is tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills . This subcommittee has jurisdiction over the budget for the United States Department of Energy and Water Development . # Appropriations process # Traditionally , after a federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year has been passed , the appropriations subcommittees receive information about what the budget sets as their spending ceilings . This is called 302(b) allocations after section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 . That amount is separated into smaller amounts for each of the twelve Subcommittees . The federal budget does not become law and is not signed by the President . Instead , it is guide for the House and the Senate in making appropriations and tax decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has procedures in place for what to do without one . The House and Senate now consider appropriations bills simultaneously , although originally the House went first . The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June . Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall . # Appropriations bills # An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates ( gives to , sets aside for ) money to specific federal government departments , agencies , and programs . The money provides funding for operations , personnel , equipment , and activities . Regular appropriations bills are passed annually , with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year . The ' ' fiscal year ' ' is the accounting period of the federal government , which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year . There are three types of appropriations bills : regular appropriations bills , continuing resolutions , and supplemental appropriations bills . Regular appropriations bills are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be enacted into law by October 1 . If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the time , it can pass a continuing resolution , which continues the pre-existing appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year ( or with minor modifications ) for a set amount of time . The third type of appropriations bills are supplemental appropriations bills , which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated at the beginning of the fiscal year . Supplemental appropriations bills can be used for things like disaster relief . Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process . They are preceded in that process by the president 's budget proposal , congressional budget resolutions , and the 302(b) allocation . The U.S. Constitution ( Article I , section 9 , clause 7 ) states that No money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law .. This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations . The President , however , still has the power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @

4 The following is the Slovak Order of Battle in 1939 during the SlovakHungarian War . # Overview # The Slovak Army was newly born from the disorganized remnants of the former and well-equipped Czechoslovak Army and Air Force . Such was Slovakia 's lack of preparedness , that the motorised Hungarian columns initially met almost no resistance , reportedly surprising two companies of Slovaks in their beds. # The situation of the Slovak Army # Lieutenant-General Augustn Malr was responsible for the defence of the eastern border with Ruthenia . VI Corps , which he had inherited from the Czecho-Slovak Army , had already been seriously disrupted the previous autumn by the Vienna Award , which had obliged it to abandon its border fortifications and remove its headquarters from Koice to Preov . The Hungarian occupation of Ruthenia ( Carpatho-Ukraine ) , where the garrison , the 12th Division , had come under VI Corps ' jurisdiction , had further undermined it . As VI Corps had largely been based among unlreliable Hungarians and Ruthenes , it had a very high proportion of Czechs in its ranks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into eastern Slovakia over the period of March 14-18 , but it then dissolved itself virtually completely as its Czech officers and men headed for home . Similarly , the regiments of the VI Corps ' Slovak-based 11th and 17th Divisions , which should have had 2000-3000 men each , were only left with between 70 and 400 Slovaks apiece once all their Czechs had gone home . This left the eastern border virtually undefended . Therefore , Malr began to fill out his skeleton units with the reservists called up on March 15 . At the same time , Generals Jurech and Imro , in the west of the country began to form units to support Malr as Slovak officers and conscripts began to return from Bohemia and Moravia , but their move to the east was delayed because roads and railways became crowded with Czech troops being repatriated in the opposite direction . The whole repatriation and reinforcement operation had to be organised by the various inexperienced and desperately overstretched Slovak staffs , especially that of Malr in Preov . There was often bad feelings on both sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be roundly abused at the station by a Slovak officer , who assumed from his rank that he must be a Czech . Some Czech troops sabotaged their equipment rather than let the Slovaks have it . Malr did manage to persuade a number of Czech officers to stay on temporarily to help Slovakia against the Hungarians , but the general confusion could not be adequately sorted out during the very brief period of hostilities with Hungary . These factors also prevented the remains of the Czechoslovak 3rd Rapid Division , which was based in the far west of the country from being deployed to good effect in the east . Its 3rd Tank Regiment was left with only 10 out of 60 officers and 222 out of 821 other ranks when all the Czech soldiers went home . This was a decisive disadvantage , because the regiment 's 70 LT vz. 34 and LT vz. 35 light tanks , 30 KD/Praga Tanik vz. 33 tankettes , 3 OA vz. 27 and 10 OA vz. 30 armoured cars were more than a match for the five obsolete Fiat 3000B light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armoured cars of the Hungarian invasion force . The only armour Malr had available in Eastern Slovakia were the 8 OA vz. 30 armoured cars and nine LT vz. 35 light tanks which the Czechs had evacuated from Carpatho-Ukraine to Humene and Preov . However , once in Slovakia their embittered Czech crews had sabotaged all of them . As a result , none of them were immediately available when the fighting started on March 23. # VI Corps # ' ' Commander-in-Chief : Lieutenant-General Augustn Malr ' ' : * 16th Infantry Regiment ' ' ( partially ) ' ' : * 20th Infantry Regiment : * 37th Infantry Regiment ' ' ( partially ) ' ' : * 12th Artillery Regiment ' ' ( partially ) ' ' : * 112th Artillery Regiment ' ' ( partially ) ' ' : * Armoured Car Platoon ' ' ( 9 OA vz. 30 armoured cars ) ' ' : * Tank Platoon ' ' ( 3 LT vz. 35 light tanks ) ' ' # Air Force # : * 45th Flight ' ' ( based in Spisk Nov Ves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * 49th Flight ' ' ( based in Spisk Nov Ves with 10 Avia B-534 fighter aircraft ) ' ' : * 12th Flight ' ' ( based in Spisk Nov Ves with 10 Letov -28 tactical reconnaissance aircraft and Aero AP-32 tactical reconnaissance aircraft ) ' ' : * 13th Flight ' ' ( based in Spisk Nov Ves with 10 Letov -28 tactical reconnaissance aircraft and AP-32 tactical reconnaissance aircraft ) ' ' # Notes # <references/> # Sources # * Axworthy , Mark W.A.

4 The Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( CPRD ) is the new English NHS observational and interventional research service , jointly funded by the NHS National Institute for Health Research ( NIHR ) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) . CPRD will be working closely with the extensive primary care , topic specific and comprehensive NIHR research networks and with the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care . # History # # Value Added Information Medical Products # The programme that would develop into the current organisation was initially developed by an Essex general practitioner , Dr Alan Dean , to facilitate day-to-day management of his own general practice , in collaboration with IT staff at the BATA shoe factory in East Tilbury near to his practice . Early programmers included a Czech programmer Yan Boda . In 2007 , GPRD announced a strategic alliance with IMS Health , which incorporated GPRD and the IMS Disease Analyzer , resulting in the most comprehensive longitudinal anonymized patient-level data in Europe . Together , these two resources encompassed medical treatment information for nearly 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and IMS enabled pharmaceutical and biotech companies , as well as governments , payers , providers and the financial and healthcare supply sectors , to make critical decisions about the impact of medicines in clinical practice across different healthcare systems . GPRD could be linked to external disease registries on an individual patient level . Registries included the hospital episode statistics , death certificates , the national cancer registry and MINAP ( cardiovascular disease ) . # Launch of the CPRD # Following the announcement by the chancellor on the Plan for Growth , a commissioned study entitled the Research Capability Programme was initiated with the aim of assessing the available research capabilities of the UK and future potential growth areas in this sector . An opportunity was identified for the collaboration of the Department of Health and the MHRA in creating a joint research service , based upon consolidating and expanding existing independent services . The new service , known as the CPRD has been developed to meet the expectations and criteria outlined by the Plan for Growth . On 29 March 2012 , the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Research ( NIHR ) launched the Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( CPRD ) . On the launch of CPRD , Sir Kent Woods , Chief Executive of the MHRA said , The Clinical Practice Research Datalink will provide new data and research services that will improve the health of patients and also make the UK a world leader in life sciences research . David Willetts , Minister for Universities and Science , said , The UK is a world leader in life sciences , but both the research base and industry tell us that we could make better use of data in order to drive medical breakthroughs . The Clinical Practice Research Datalink will provide researchers with access to safeguarded data that respects patient confidentiality . This will give valuable insights into serious health conditions and ultimately help reduce the time it takes to develop new treatments . The GPRD became part of the data services provision from CPRD . At its launch in April 2012 , CPRD was established as the new , England-wide NHS observational and interventional research service . It has built on the research developments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( HRSS ) previously managed by the NIHR Research Capability Program . *The GPRD was a large primary care database , containing anonymised primary care data and links to a number of NHS and other data sources .

Further access and partnerships have been established to include data sets from other European countries . The linking of anonomysed primary care data with large data registries and related data sets means the CPRD can offer a huge array of data and information for the inclusion in medical research studies . This will include areas such as ; prescription drugs uses and effect , long term patient treatment strategy , long term health benefit studies , epidemic and pandemic studies and demographic health and welfare studies . # Research Services # The CPRD has a range of research experience and expertise including : * Pharmacoepidemiology * Pharmacoeconomics * Research Guidance * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * Data verification services The CPRD provides consulting services for a range of research activities .

4 el = 1,500 V DC overhead catenary The is a railway line operated by the Odakyu Electric Railway in Japan . The line runs in the southwestern portion of Greater Tokyo , from Shin-Yurigaoka Station to Karakida Station . Used for commuter service by the residents of Tama New Town , the largest New Town in Japan , rapid trains are often on the line , through to the terminus of the operator Shinjuku on the main line ( Odawara Line ) or downtown via Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line . ' ' Tama Express ' ' trains terminate at Toride Station in Toride , Ibaraki , on the opposite side of Tokyo . A Limited express service is also provided in the evening , with Odakyu Romancecar EMUs. # History # This line was built as a part of Tokyo Line 9 , linked with Chiyoda Line and Odawara Line , as described in Transport Policy Council Report No. 18 in 2000 from the Ministry of Transport ( present Ministry of Land , Infrastructure and Transport ( MILT ) . Odakyu started service on the first section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It expanded to Tama Center , the central station of Tama New Town , on April 23 , 1975 . This section was constructed by the national Japan Railway Construction Corporation , since renamed the Japan Railway Construction , Transport and Technology Agency ( JRTT ) , while Odakyu operated it and paid for the organization . On March 27 , 1990 , Odakyu opened Karakida station . The line was constructed on double track , but Odakyu could not take a large part of the transport between Tokyo and Tama New Town . Delay of the quadrupling of the main Odawara Line due to long standing land acquisition conflicts prevented operating extra trains that were to connect the new town and the terminus of Shinjuku . Rapid train service on the Tama Line began in 2000 , and succeeded in increasing the number of passengers , shorting transit time . # Rapid service # ; ( LE ) : Down from Shinjuku , only in evenings , none to Shinjuku .

The building is the part of a new generation of skyscrapers in San Francisco 's downtown built on Mission Street since 2000 , including The Paramount , the St. Regis Museum Tower , Millennium Tower , 101 Second Street , and JP MorganChase Building . # History # The tower was originally approved by the Planning Commission on April 5 , 2001 to rise 137.5 m and 30 stories . A revised plan , adding three stories and raising the height to 147 m , was approved on December 13 , 2001 .

In October 2009 , Intellectual Property law firm Novak Druce + Quigg moved into the 34th floor penthouse of the building . As of summer 2008 , close to half of the building 's office space has been leased , with the possibility of more tenants moving in . In 2010 , Deloitte signed a 15-year lease to occupy 10 floors of the building , becoming the anchor tenant , and taking up most of the remaining space . # Design # 555 Mission Street is 147 m with 33 above ground office floors on a site located on Mission Street . There are two basement levels containing 180 parking spaces in a below-grade parking garage . The entire building is split into three zones , which are referred to as Low Rise , Mid Rise , and High Rise .

9514 Antnio Dacosta ( 3 November 1914 in Angra do Herosmo , Azores , Portugal &amp;ndash ; 2 December 1990 , Paris , France ) was a Portuguese painter , poet and art critic and a pioneer of the surrealistic movement in Portugal . # Early life # Although he had no formal art training , Dacosta drew and painted from an early age . He completed his studies at the Angra high school and in 1935 left the Azores to attend the Escola de Belas Artes ( School of Fine Arts ) in Lisbon . Strongly opposed to the Salazar dictatorship in Portugal and horrified by the violence of the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent Nationalist victory , his painting took a menacing and surrealistic turn . He displayed his first paintings at Casa Repe in 1940 along with Antnio Pedro and an English sculptor , Pamela Boden . He also showed at the annual national Salon of Modern Art where he won the Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso Prize in 1942 . He became one of the forerunners of the surrealistic movement in Portugal . Many of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studio where he was working . The remaining paintings are owned by private collectors or Portuguese museums . Throughout the 1940s he wrote art criticism for Portuguese newspapers and illustrated books for several contemporary Portuguese authors . # Paris # In 1947 , the French government awarded him a grant to spend a year in Paris , where he stayed for the rest of his life . For the first time , he was in direct contact with original masterpieces as well as the works of contemporary international artists . Post-war creativity was a revelation to him and he began to doubt the importance of his own work . He progressively stopped painting but nonetheless in 1948 sent two paintings to the Surrealist Group Show in Lisbon . In 1952 , his first successful one-man show ( 17 Paintings 1940 1950 ) was held at the Galeria de Maro in Lisbon . By 1953 , he was no longer painting . He became a reporter for a Brazilian newspaper O Estado , writing about the Paris art scene ( theatre , literature and art exhibitions ) . These articles ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later published in book-form Dacosta em Paris by Assirio &amp; Alvim ( 1999 ) . Dacosta is today considered a pioneer of Portuguese surrealist art . In the 1950s , many Portuguese artists , including Ren Bertholo , travelled to Paris in search of new ideas and Dacosta became a valuable inspiration for them and a source of information about Parisian artistic life . # Return to Painting # In 1969 Dacosta attended a retrospective of his works from 1939 to 1948 at the Galeria Buchholz in Lisbon and in 1978 his paintings were included in ' ' Portuguese Art since 1910 ' ' at the Royal Academy of London , a show that he visited with his friend and fellow-artist , Jlio Pomar . Rediscovering his earlier works at this show ( he owned none of them ) perhaps gave him an impetus to return to painting . In 1971 he moved with his wife , Miriam Rewald , the gallerist , and two young children to Janville , a small town south of Paris , where he started making little objects , things , as he liked to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Manuel Alves , he timidly acquired painting material . Although he never tried to show his work publicly , word got around as he occasionally showed a new drawing or object to visitors . In the mid-1970s he stopped sending his articles to Brazil and , thanks to a grant from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation , became free to paint . His surrealism disappeared and gave way to a completely new style , devoid of the uneasiness and aura of danger in his earlier works . He also began to utilise pagan-religious images from his childhood in the Azores . A peaceful and mystical element entered his paintings , a very personal style - figurative but not representative . In 1983 a one man show at Galeria 111 in Lisbon revealed his recent paintings , which were all sold to private and public collections . This success encouraged Dacosta to create more work . He was awarded the national art prize by the Portuguese art critics association in 1984 and honoured with the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit by Portuguese President , Mrio Soares , in 1988. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lisbon ( catalogue text by Fernando Lemos ) *1968 : Foundation Calouste Gulbenkian , Paris . *1969 : Retrospective 1939-1948 , Galeria Buchholz , Lisbon ( catalogue text by Rui Mrio Gonalves ) . *1978 : ' ' Portuguese Art since 1910 ' ' , Royal Academy , London . *1983 : Galeria 111 , Lisbon ( catalogue text by Rui Mrio Gonalves ) *1984 : Galeria Zen , Porto ( catalogue text by Rui Mrio Goncalves ) *1985 : Portuguese pavilion , Biennale of 1985 , So Paulo , Brazil . *1988 : Foundation Calouste Gulbenkian , Paris . *1988 : Centro de arte moderna , Lisbon and Casa de Serralves Museum , Porto ( catalogue texts by Fernando de Azevedo , Maria Helena de Freitas , Rui Mrio Gonalves , Jlio Pomar and Jos Sommer Ribeiro ) . *1995 : Sala Nobre da Secretaria Regional da Educao e Cultura Angra do Herosmo , Azores ( catalogue text by Ruth Rosengarten ) . *1997 : ' ' Antnio Dacosta : peintre et pote portugais ' ' , Maison de la Posie , Paris . *1997 : ' ' Antnio Dacosta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . *1999 : Bermuda National Gallery and New Bedford Museum of Art ( catalogue text by Ruth Rosengarten ) *2006 : Casa de Serralves Museum , Porto . *2007 : ' ' Antnio Dacosta : Scne Ouverte ' ' , Foundation Calouste Gulbenkian , Paris ( catalogue texts by Joo Pedro Garcia , Jos-Luis Porfrio and Alain Tapi ) . # Final Years # He was commissioned to decorate a wall in the new building of the Azorean Government in Horta . He spent several months in Horta , installing a series of fifty-four heads in bas-relief representing Azorean citizens . A monument designed by Dacosta was built and inaugurated in the Azores by the Sala Nobre da Secretaria Regional da Educao e Cultura Angra do Herosmo in 1995 . He began a series of drawings to decorate the walls of Cais do Sodr , a new subway station in Lisbon . However due to increasing bad health painting became difficult and the commission was completed under the auspices of his friend and fellow artist Pedro Morais and inaugurated in 1998 .

He served for over 40 years in the post of porter of the Capuchin friary in Alttting , through which work he gained a widespread reputation for his wisdom and holiness . He has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church . # Life # # Early life # Born 22 December 1818 , <ref> </REF> he was baptized with the name of John , the son of Bartholomus Birndorfer and Gertrude Niedermayer , and was born on the family farm in Bad Griesbach , now a part of the town of Parzham , then in the Kingdom of Bavaria , now part of Germany . He was the ninth son in a peasant family . From his earliest years , the young Hansel ( a diminutive of John ) gave indications of his future sanctity by his modesty and love of solitude . His devotion was noticeable especially when he prayed in church , the distant location of which was no hindrance to his visiting it frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Blessed Virgin , and each day fervently recited the Rosary . On feast days he frequently made a journey to some remote shrine of the Blessed Mother .

John spent his early years on the family farm , losing his mother when he was 14 . At the age of 31 , after his father 's death , he decided to leave the secular world . After disposing of his inheritance , he was admitted , first as a tertiary , then , two years later , as a lay brother among the Capuchin Franciscan friars . <ref> SQPN </REF> Upon entering the novitiate , he was given the name Conrad by which he was known for the remainder of his life . # Brother Porter # Immediately after his profession he was sent to the Friary of St. Ann , in the city of Alttting .

His spare moments during the day were spent in a nook near the door where it was possible for him to see and adore the Blessed Sacrament . During the night he would deprive himself of several hours of sleep , to devote the time to prayer either in the oratory of the friars or in the church . It was generally believed that he never took any rest , but continually occupied himself in work and exercises of devotion .

Four years later , the same pope , approving additional miracles which had been performed , solemnly inscribed his name in the list of saints

82514 Christopher Hugh Sykes FRSL ( 17 November 1907 &amp;ndash ; 8 December 1986 ) was an English author . Born into a well-off north-of-England landowning family , he was the second son of the diplomat Sir Mark Sykes ( 18791919 ) . His uncle , also Christopher Sykes , was , for a time , a close friend of Edward VII . Educated at Downside School and the University of Oxford ( Christ Church ) , Sykes was , for a time in his youth , in the Foreign Office , including a stint as an attach(192829) in the British Embassy in Berlin , where Harold Nicolson was then Counsellor . This was followed by a year ( 193031 ) at the British Legation in Teheran . An early hero was Aubrey Herbert , remembered now as the man who inspired John Buchan 's classic thriller , ' ' Greenmantle ' ' . Though Sykes thought of making politics his career , his stammer and also his artistic and imaginative disposition indicated that political life was not for him . At the School of Oriental Studies in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling in Central Asia during 1933-34 with Robert Byron , who later wrote ' ' The Road to Oxiana ' ' recounting their long expedition in what was then an almost unexplored country . On their return to England , Sykes and Byron wrote a novel together under the name of Richard Waughburton , Innocence and Design , published in 1935 . A little later , Sykes and Cyril Connolly planned a book jointly with the title of ' ' The Little Voice ' ' . In common with other projects of Connolly 's , the book never got beyond the planning stages . Sykes published in 1936 a biography of the German Arabist Wilhelm Wassmus ; he did not , during later years , include this volume in his list of his publications . A memoir of Byron , killed at sea in 1941 , was included in Sykes ' bestselling book , ' ' Four Studies in Loyalty ' ' . When war broke out in 1939 , Sykes was commissioned in the 7th battalion of the Green Howards . Eventually , he was posted to GHC in Cairo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel , ' ' High Minded Murder ' ' ( 1944 ) , something of a ' ' roman clef ' ' , set in wartime Cairo . Following that , he was posted to Teheran before being transferred to the Special Air Service . In this capacity he undertook extremely hazardous work with the French Resistance : an experience which , like his friendship with Byron , was depicted in ' ' Four Studies in Loyalty ' ' , this time in that book 's last chapter . Nowadays Sykes is especially remembered for his biography of his friend , Evelyn Waugh ( the two were both Catholics , but with the notable difference mentioned by Waugh 's son Auberon when reviewing Sykes 's book in the November 1975 issue of ' ' Books and Bookmen ' ' that whereas Waugh converted to Roman Catholicism in his twenties , Sykes was a cradle Catholic ) and , to a lesser extent , for his classic history of the British Mandate of Palestine , ' ' Crossroads to Israel ' ' ( 1965 ) . He also wrote several books of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the Lawrence of Judea ( a phrase that Wingate deplored ) ; Lady Astor , who , born in Virginia , was one of the first women to sit in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom ; and Adam von Trott zu Solz , executed following his part in the failed 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler . After 1945 Sykes worked for many years in BBC Radio , as well as writing for several British and American periodicals , including ' ' The New Republic ' ' , ' ' The Spectator ' ' , ' ' Books and Bookmen ' ' , ' ' The Observer ' ' and the short-lived ' ' English Review Magazine ' ' . He was invested as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature . # Marriage and family # He married Camilla Georgiana Russell , daughter of Sir Thomas Wentworth Russell ( Russell Pasha ) and Evelyn Dorothea Temple Moore , on 25 October 1936 .

95514 A square-up was a common feature of exploitation films in the 1940s and 1950s . With the exception of most burlesque features during the 1950s , the films would begin with a written message about what social or moral issue the film was planning to address . For instance , ' ' She Shoulda Said No ! ' ' contained a square-up concerning youth drug abuse , and ' ' Child Bride ' ' the issue of child marriage . The first square-up has been traced to Eureka Productions 's 1912 film ' ' The Evil Art ( or ) Gambling Exposed ' ' . The general reasoning for the square-up was an expression of regret for presenting the subject of the film followed by a statement with the desire that the film will help in efforts to combat the subject . Often , these justifications were created with the intent to work around the production code , giving the films educational or social value as opposed to being simply exploitation features , but also served the purpose of warming up the audience for the upcoming film contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David F. Friedman has explained that , in some cities , the police would not allow a full screening of a film with nudity or other objectionable content . Following the announcement to the now-upset crowd , the edited film was shown , and , after the film was over , a second reel with the excised material was shown . Coming from the carnival term squaring a beef , these square-up reels became typical . In some cases , such as ' ' The Girls of Loma-Loma ' ' , the entire film became a short square-up reel .

4 The Bay County Library System , in Bay County , Michigan , was established on January 1 , 1974 after the county electorate approved a 0.7 million dollar tax levy for five years . The Library System brought together three libraries ( The Bay City Public Library and its Broadway Branch , The Sage Library , and The Pinconning Library ) which previously were funded separately and independently by the cities of Bay City and Pinconning . These branches , together with the Auburn Area Branch Library ( established in September 1973 ) , the South Side Branch Library ( formerly the Broadway Branch ) , and the Bookmobile ( which began operation in March 1975 ) would comprise the six service outlets of the Library System . In 2000 , Bay County voters approved a millage increase and bond issue to support capital improvements to the system , including new buildings for the Bay City and Pinconning branches and additions and renovations to the Auburn , Sage , and Southside branches Renovations to the Auburn and Sage branches were completed in the winter and spring of 2004 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October 2004 . In December 2005 the Bay City Branch was replaced by the new Alice and Jack Wirt Public Library . In 2006 , voters twice failed to pass the operating millage required the provided 60 percent of the system 's operating funds . As a result , the Bay County Library Board voted to close the South Side and Sage branch libraries , suspend Bookmobile service , and open the Auburn , Pinconning , and Wirt branches for restricted hours . . The closure of Sage Library suspended its run as the oldest continuously operating library in the state of Michigan . Renovations to the South Side Branch are currently on hold pending resolution of the library 's current operating funding situation In 2007 , voters passed a reduced millage that allowed the Library System to once again open Sage and allow for more hours and services at all branches . 
4514 Empress Shen Miaorong ( ) was an empress of the Chinese Chen Dynasty . Her husband was Emperor Wen ( Chen Qian ) , a nephew of the founding Emperor Wu ( Chen Baxian ) . # Early life # Shen Miaorong was from Wuxing Commandery ( , roughly modern Huzhou , Zhejiang ) as was her husband 's clan .

4 Rlinda Kett is a fictional character from the ' Saga of Seven Suns ' series of novels by Kevin J. Anderson . # Biography # Rlinda Kett was a trader and was once the head of a group of five trader ships that were reduced to four with the capture of the ' ' Great Expectations ' ' by Roamer pirate Rand Sorengaard and the execution of the captain Gabriel Mesta . Kett was on board the EDF capital ship in the Yreka system when the pirates were brought to justice , one of her five ex-husbands and trader ship captains Branson Roberts serving as the bait that drew out the Roamers . Although she hated Rand Sorengaard and his comrades Kett still thought the punishment handed out by Kurt Lanyan was too harsh . Before the onset of the war against the hydrogues Rlinda Kett travelled to Theroc to talk with the commercially minded Sarein about the possibility of trade between the Therons and the Terran Hanseatic League . Kett 's desire to tap into the market for Theron food and textiles was nearly ruined by Sarein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green priests however Rlinda did still acquire a large cargo of Theron goods . These items were largely bought up by the then Prime Designate Jora'h and consequently other Ildirans after Rlinda transported them as well as the green priests Otema and Nira to Ildira . Rlinda 's fleet was further reduced to the single ship ' ' Voracious Curiosity ' ' when the rest of her ships were commandeered by the EDF for the war against the hydrogues . With the restriction of ekti by the Terran Hanseatic League , Rlinda was also confined to a landing field on the Moon despite her inability to pay the fee . However , Rlinda did receive a message from her favourite ex-husband informing her he was deserting the EDF and fleeing to Crenna . Basil Wenceslas spared Rlinda Kett a continued stay on the Moon as he needed someone to take his agent Davlin Lotze to Rheindic Co to search for the missing xenoarchaeologists Louis and Margaret Colicos . This assignment required Rlinda to pick up Lotze at the former Ildiran world of Crenna , where she was reunited with Branson Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co Rlinda trekked around with Davlin Lotze for a while until the exosociologist stepped through a reactivated Klikiss transportal and vanished . Although concerned for Davlin Lotze , Rlinda Kett did not travel through the portal herself but instead stayed on Rheindic Co to wait for Lotze 's return . This decision likely saved Lotze 's life as he did return to Rheindic Co some days later , and the pair set off back to Earth so that Davlin could report the transportal system and its colonisation potential to Basil Wenceslas . Due to the colonisation initiative that was started because of Davlin Lotze 's discovery , Rlinda Kett was employed to transport heavy machinery too big to be transferred through the Klikiss portals to old Klikiss worlds . After talking to Basil Wenceslas Rlinda also got Branson Roberts involved in the initiative - despite General Kurt Lanyan 's belief that all deserters were traitors - and the Chairman promised not to report the man to the General but said that he could not protect him if he was found out . While carrying machinery to Corribus , Rlinda Kett and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested their assistance in evacuating the population of Crenna . The trio succeeded in this mission although they were not warmly received back on Relleker . Rlinda stayed on the planet for a while before taking a shipload of refugees back to Earth , and consequently discovering that Branson Roberts - who had departed Relleker earlier to complete the delivery to Corribus - had been arrested for desertion . Rlinda failed to defend Branson Roberts despite her best efforts but did fly off from Mars on board the ' ' Voracious Curiosity ' ' with Branson Roberts after Davlin Lotze succeeded in freeing the pilot . Chased by EDF remoras , Rlinda took her ship to a far flung star system after witnessing the destruction of ' ' Blind Faith ' ' which had been piloted by Davlin Lotze but was tracked to the area by EDF forces . To escape capture Rlinda dived into the atmosphere of the system 's gas giant and circle the world only to be captured by Roamers from one of the icy moons of the gas giant . # Appearances/ Sources # * Hidden Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suns

4 ' ' Peevyhouse v. Garland Coal &amp; Mining Co. ' ' , 382 P.2d 109 ( Okl. 1962 ) , is a US contract law case decided by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma . It concerns the question of when specific performance of a contractual obligation will be granted and the measure of expectation damages . # Facts # Willie and Lucille Peevyhouse owned a farm containing coal deposits . In November 1954 , they entered into a contract with Garland Coal &amp; Mining Co . They gave Garland a five year lease to strip mine the coal , in return for a royalty , and the promise that the land would be restored once they were done . In the lease agreement was the following : # 7d Lessee agrees to leave the creek crossing the above premises in such a condition that it will not interfere with the crossings to be made in pits as set out in 7b. # # 7f Lessee further agrees to leave no shale or dirt on the high wall of said pits . # Coal mining can often work through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cheaper . To restore the land the overburden must be shifted back , in this case at a cost of $29,000 . When there were recurrent floods , Garland refused to put the land back . The Peevyhouses sued . The jury returned a verdict for the Peevyhouses for $5,000 and Garland appealed again . # Judgment # The Supreme Court of Oklahoma found that , while the coal company breached its contract with the Peevyhouses , Garland did not have to fix the property nor pay for the work necessary to restore the land , but instead could just pay the Peevyhouses for the difference in land value . The land , while destroyed , had only lost $300 in value . The Court found that to pay the Peevyhouses to restore their land would be an economic waste , since the $25,000 in labor would result only in a $300 improvement of the land . Justice Jackson gave the leading judgment . Briefly stated , the facts are as follows : plaintiffs owned a farm containing coal deposits , and in November 1954 , leased the premises to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes . A strip-mining operation was contemplated in which the coal would be taken from pits on the surface of the ground , instead of from underground mine shafts . In addition to the usual covenants found in a coal mining lease , defendant specifically agreed to perform certain restorative and remedial work at the end of the lease period . It is unnecessary to set out the details of the work to be done , other than to say that it would involve the moving of many thousands of cubic yards of dirt , at a cost estimated by expert witnesses at about $29,000.00 . However , plaintiffs sued for only $25,000.00 . During the trial , it was stipulated that all covenants and agreements in the lease contract had been fully carried out by both parties , except the remedial work mentioned above ; defendant conceded that this work had not been done . Plaintiffs introduced expert testimony as to the amount and nature of the work to be done . Over plaintiffs ' objections , defendant thereafter introduced expert testimony as to the diminution in value of plaintiffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance as agreed in the contractthat is , the difference between the present value of the farm , and what its value would have been if defendant had done what it agreed to ... The jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs for $5,000.00 Only a fraction of the cost of performance , but more than the total value of the farm even after the remedial work is done . On appeal , the issue is sharply drawn . Plaintiffs contend that the true measure of damages in this case is what it will cost plaintiffs to obtain performance of the work that was not done because of defendant 's default . Defendant argues that the measure of damages is the cost of performance limited , however , to the total difference in the market value before and after the work was performed . ... If the remedial work were done said Justice Jackson , Peevyhouse 's farm 's market value increase only $300 . We therefore hold that where , in a coal mining lease , lessee agrees to perform certain remedial work on the premises concerned at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performed by both parties except that the remedial work is not done , the measure of damages in an action by lessor against lessee for damages for breach of contact is ordinarily the reasonable cost of performance of the work ; however , where the contract provision breached was merely incidental to the main purpose in view , and where the economic benefit which would result to lessor by full performance of the work is grossly disproportionate to the cost of performance , the damages which lessor may recover are limited to the diminution in value resulting to the premises because of the non-performance . Under the most liberal view of the evidence herein , the diminution in value resulting to the premises because of non-performance of the remedial work was $300.00 .. It thus appears that the judgment was clearly excessive , and that the amount for which judgment should have been rendered is definitely and satisfactorily shown by the record . Justices Welch , Davison , Halley and Johnson concurred . Chief Justice Williams , Blackbird VCJ , Berry J and Irwin J dissented . Justice Irwin 's dissent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question could have been reasonably approximated when the contract was negotiated and executed , and there are no conditions now existing which could not have been reasonably anticipated by the parties . Therefore , defendant had knowledge , when it prevailed upon the plaintiffs to execute the lease , that the cost of performance might be disproportionate to the value or benefits received by plaintiff for the performance ... In the instant action defendant has made no attempt to even substantially perform . The contract in question is not immoral , is not tainted with fraud , and was not entered into through mistake or accident and is not contrary to public policy . It is clear and unambiguous and the parties understood the terms thereof , and the approximate cost of fulfilling the obligations could have been approximately ascertained . There are no conditions existing now which could not have been reasonably anticipated when the contract was negotiated and executed . The defendant could have performed the contract if it desired . It has accepted and reaped the benefits of its contract and now urges that plaintiffs under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my opinion , the plaintiffs were entitled to specific performance of the contract and since defendant has failed to perform , the proper measure of damages should be the cost of performance . # Addendum # According to Swan , Reiter and Bala , Two of the judges who sided with the majority in Peevyhouse were later involved in a serious bribery scandal . There is some suggestion that counsel for Garland Coal could have improperly influenced some of the judges in other cases , but there is no suggestion that a bribe affected the outcome in Peevyhouse , a case of relatively little financial consequence to Garland Coal . # Controversy # The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit determined in ' ' Rock Island Improvement Co. v. Helmerich &amp; Payne , Inc. , ' ' 698 F.2d 1075 ( 10th Cir. 1984 ) that the Oklahoma Supreme Court relied on an Oklahoma statute providing that no person can recover a greater amount in damages for a breach of an obligation than he would have gained by the full performance thereof on both sides , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land Reclamation Act of 1967 , declaring it the policy of Oklahoma to provide , after mining operations are completed , for the reclamation and conservation of land subjected to surface disturbance by open cut mining . Therefore , reasoned the Tenth Circuit , We are convinced that the Oklahoma Supreme Court would no longer apply the rule it established in Peevyhouse in 1963 . Relying on ' ' Rock Island ' ' , the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma in ' ' Davis v. Shell Oil Co. ' ' ( 795 F.Supp. 381 ) asserted as fact that courts in Oklahoma do not follow ' ' Peevyhouse ' ' . However , in a rebuke to both Federal Courts , the Oklahoma Supreme Court sharply reasserted the ' ' Peevyhouse ' ' rule in ' ' Schneberger v. Apache Corp. , ' ' 890 P.2d 847 ( Okla. 1994 ) , declaring whatever the rationale , the essence of the ' ' Peevyhouse ' ' holding--to award diminution in value rather , than cost of performance , has been consistently adhered to .. and it @ @ @ @ @ @

However , on her accession to the throne Queen Mary removed the house from the possession of Princess Elizabeth and restored it to Tunstall , together with his see , as it had become apparent Tunstall no longer had a London residence . Mary 's predecessor , Lady Jane Grey , the Nine Days Queen of England , was married at Durham House on May 21 or 25 , 1553 to Guilford Dudley . Upon her accession , Elizabeth seized possession of Durham House again , and deprived Tunstall of his see ; she kept possession of the residence until 1583 , when she granted it to Sir Walter Raleigh . Raleigh spent 2,000 on repairs and lived there until Elizabeth 's death . John Aubrey said that he well remembered the room which Raleigh used as his study ; it was in a little turret that looked over the Thames and had a view of Westminster , Whitehall Palace , and the Surrey hills . It was in Durham House that Raleigh hosted Manteo and Wanchese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the New World . In 1584 Sir Walter Raleigh had dispatched the first of a number of expeditions to Roanoke island to explore and eventually settle the new land of Virginia . Early encounters with the natives were friendly , and , despite the difficulties in communication , the explorers were able to persuade two of the savages , being lustie men , whose names were Wanchese and Manteo to accompany them on the return voyage to London , Once safely delivered to England , the two Indians quickly made a sensation at the royal court . Raleigh 's priority however was not publicity but rather intelligence about his new land of Virginia , and he restricted access to the exotic newcomers , assigning the brilliant scientist Thomas Harriot the job of deciphering and learning the Carolina Algonquian language , using a phonetic alphabet of his own invention in order to effect the translation . Upon Elizabeth 's death and Raleigh 's resultant loss of influence at court , Tobias Matthew , then bishop of Durham , reclaimed Durham House for the see and offered it for use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved the move . # Decline # Neither Matthew nor any of his successors resided at Durham House , and it became dilapidated as a result . The stables were demolished for construction of the New Exchange , a market which was occupied by milliners and seamstresses in shops along upper and lower tiers on each side of a central alley . In the 1630s it was the setting for the Durham House Group , including Richard Neile , William Laud and other high church Anglicans . The best portion of the house was tenanted by Thomas Coventry , 1st Baron Coventry Lord Keeper Coventry , who died there in 1640 . What remained of the house was subsequently obtained by Philip Herbert , 5th Earl of Pembroke . He rented it from the see for 200 per year and intended to build a fine house on the site , which was never realised . Instead , he constructed on the site Durham Street , which ran through the old remains down to the River Thames and the upper portion of which survives at its junction with the Strand .

514 David Aspden served one term as the 45th mayor of Barrie , Ontario from 2006 2010 . Aspden defeated incumbent Mayor Robert J. Hamilton in the 2006 municipal election by a margin of 14,616 to 12,175 votes .

4 * Kingdom of Poland * Duchy of Pomerania * Kalmar Union * Holy Roman Empire * King of Denmark * King of Norway * King of Sweden * Duke of Pomerania * Duke of Pomerelia * Prince of Rgen The House of Griffins or House of Pomerania ( ; ) , also known as ' ' House of Greifen ' ' ; was a dynasty of dukes ruling the Duchy of Pomerania from the 12th century until 1637 . The name Griffins was used by the dynasty after the 15th century and had been taken from the ducal coat of arms . Wartislaw I ( around 1091 died August 9 , 1135 ) was the first historical ruler of the Duchy of Pomerania and the founder of the Griffin dynasty . The most prominent Griffin was Eric of Pomerania , who became king of the Kalmar Union in 1397 , thus ruling Denmark , Sweden and Norway . Another Griffin , The last Griffin duke of Pomerania was Bogislaw XIV , who died during the Thirty Years ' War , which led to the division of Pomerania between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Duke Bogislaw XIII and the last Griffin died in 1660. # Name of the Dynasty # The dynasty is known by two names , Pomerania , after their primary fief , and Griffin , after their coat of arms , which had depicted a griffin since the late 12th century : The first verifiable use of the griffin as the dynasty 's heraldic emblem occurred in a seal of Casimir II , Duke of Pomerania , which showed the imaginary beast within a shield , and was attached to a document dated 1194 . The name ' ' Pomerania ' ' comes from Slavic ' ' po more ' ' , which means ' ' Land at the Sea ' ' . # Origins and branches # The origins of the Griffins are not clear . Most theories derive them from either local Slavic nobility or a cadet branch of Polish house of Piasts . Medieval Polish chronicler Jan Dugosz connected them with Polish noble family of wiebodzice from the south province of Poland named the Lesser Poland , who also used a griffin as their coat-of-arms . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings from Sorbs mythology called ' ' Gryphus ' ' or ' ' Baltus ' ' . The first known members of the Griffins were the brothers Wartislaw I and Ratibor I. Wartislaw would be the ancestor of the line of dukes that ruled the Duchy of Pomerania until 1630 ; Ratibor would be the ancestor of the Ratiborides branch of the Griffins , that was to rule the lands of Schlawe-Stolp until the line went extinct and the area was incorporated in the Duchy of Pomerania . The first known member of the Swantiborides branch of the Griffins , notable for as castellans of Pomeranian cities , was Wartislaw ( II ) Swantiboriz. # Wartislaw I to Bogislaw IV and Otto I # #Wartislaw I ( between 1134 and 1148 ) @2Bogislaw I ( * about 1130 ; 1187 ) ( I ) Walburgis ( 1177 ) , daughter of Valdemar I of Denmark ; **6;280473;br ( II ) Anastasia , daughter of Mieszko III of Poland and Eudoxia of Kiev @2# ( I ) Ratibor ( * 1160 ; 1183 ) Salome , daughter of Mieszko III of Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

4 Donna Sancha of Aragon ( 1478 in Gaeta 1506 in Naples ) , or Sancia of Aragon , was an illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso II of Naples and his mistress Trogia Gazzela . In 1494 , she was married to Gioffre Borgia , youngest son of Pope Alexander VI . Upon her marriage , she and her new husband were created Prince and Princess of Squillace , a province in the south of Italy . Allegedly , Sancha had affairs with both of her husband Gioffre 's older brothers : Juan Borgia , 2nd Duke of Gandia also known as Giovanni Borgia and Cesare Borgia . Her affair with Juan Borgia is sometimes said to be the reason for Cesare 's alleged murder of Juan in 1497 . Sancha 's brother , Alfonso of Aragon , married the Pope 's daughter , Lucrezia Borgia , who was sister to Cesare , Juan , and Gioffre . Sancha 's life among the Borgias became a turbulent one after Cesare made an advantageous marriage with a French princess , Charlotte d'Albret , in order to secure French support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct conflict with those of the Italian states . Sancha 's home city of Naples was no exception , and it had long been nervous about militant French interests . Her brother Alfonso was brutally murdered in 1500 by Cesare , who was jealous of his influence over Lucrezia . Sancha herself , now a political embarrassment , was imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome until the death of Pope Alexander in 1503 .

4 Thermometric titration is one of a number of instrumental titration techniques where endpoints can be located accurately and precisely without a subjective interpretation on the part of the analyst as to their location . Enthalpy change is arguably the most fundamental and universal property of chemical reactions , so the observation of temperature change is a natural choice in monitoring their progress . It is not a new technique , with possibly the first recognizable thermometric titration method reported early in the 20th century ( Bell and Cowell , 1913 ) . In spite of its attractive features , and in spite of the considerable research that has been conducted in the field and a large body of applications that have been developed ; it has been until now an under-utilized technique in the critical area of industrial process and quality control . Automated potentiometric titration systems have pre-dominated in this area since the 1970s . With the advent of cheap computers able to handle the powerful thermometric titration software , development has now reached the stage where easy to use automated thermometric titration systems can in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications of thermometric titrimetry discussed on this page are by no means exhaustive . The reader is referred to the bibliography for further reading on the subject . # Comparison between potentiometric and thermometric titrations. # Potentiometric titrimetry has been the predominant automated titrimetric technique since the 1970s , so it is worthwhile considering the basic differences between it and thermometric titrimetry . **25;578;TOOLONG titrations rely on a free energy change in the reaction system . Measurement of a free energy dependent term is necessary . : ' ' G ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> = - ' ' RT ' ' ln ' ' K ' ' ( 1 ) Where : : G <sup> 0 </sup> = change on free energy : ' ' R ' ' = universal gas constant : ' ' T ' ' = temperature in kelvins ( K ) or degrees Rankine ( R ) : ' ' K ' ' = equilibrium constant at temperature ' ' T ' ' : ln is the natural logarithm function In order for a reaction to be amenable to potentiometric titrimetry , the free energy change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant inflection ( or kink ) in the titration curve where sensor response is plotted against the amount of titrant delivered . However , free energy is just one of three related parameters in describing any chemical reaction : : ' ' H ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> = ' ' G ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> + ' ' T ' ' ' ' S ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> ( 2 ) where : : ' ' H ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> = change in enthalpy : ' ' G ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> = change in free energy : ' ' S ' ' <sup> 0 </sup> = change in entropy : ' ' T ' ' = temperature in K For any reaction where the free energy is not opposed by the entropy change , the enthalpy change will be significantly greater than the free energy . Thus a titration based on a change in temperature ( which permits observation of the enthalpy change ) will show a greater inflection than will curves obtained from sensors reacting to free energy changes alone . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added at a known constant rate to a titrand until the completion of the reaction is indicated by a change in temperature . The endpoint is determined by an inflection in the curve generated by the output of a temperature measuring device . Consider the titration reaction : : ' ' a ' ' A + ' ' b ' ' B = ' ' p ' ' P ( 3 ) Where : : A = the titrant , and ' ' a ' ' = the corresponding number of moles reacting : B = the analyte , and ' ' b ' ' = the corresponding number of moles reacting : P = the product , and ' ' p ' ' = the corresponding number of moles produced At completion , the reaction produces a molar heat of reaction ' ' H ' ' <sub> r </sub> which is shown as a measurable temperature change ' ' T ' ' . In an ideal system , where no losses or gains of heat due to environmental influences are involved , the progress of the reaction is observed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether ' ' H ' ' <sub> r </sub> is negative ( indicating an exothermic reaction ) or positive ( indicating an endothermic reaction ) . In this context , environmental influences may include : *Heat losses or gains from outside the system via the vessel walls and cover ; *Differences in the temperature between the titrant and the titrand ; *Evaporative losses from the surface of the rapidly mixed fluid ; *Heats of solution when the titrant solvent is mixed with the analyte solvent ; *Heat introduced by the mechanical action of stirring ( minor influence ) ; and *Heat produced by the thermistor itself ( very minor influence ) . If the equilibrium for the reaction lies far to the right ( i.e. a stoichiometric equilibrium has been achieved ) , then when all analyte has been reacted by the titrant continuing addition of titrant will be revealed by a sharp break in the temperature/volume curve . Figures 1a and 1b illustrate idealized examples . The shape of experimentally obtained thermometric titration plots will vary from such idealized examples , and some of the environmental influences listed above may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This can be due to insensitivity of the sensor or where thermal equilibrium at the endpoint is slow to occur . It can also occur where the reaction between titrant and titrand does not proceed to stoichiometric completion . The determinant of the degree to which a reaction will proceed to completion is the free energy change . If this is favourable , then the reaction will proceed to be completion and be essentially stoichiometric . In this case , the sharpness of the endpoint is dependent on the magnitude of the enthalpy change . If it is unfavourable , the endpoint will be rounded regardless of the magnitude of the enthalpy change . Reactions where non-stoichiometric equilibria are evident can be used to obtain satisfactory results using a thermometric titration approach . If the portions of the titration curve both prior to and after the endpoint are reasonably linear , then the intersection of tangents to these lines will accurately locate the endpoint . This is illustrated in Figure 2 . Consider the reaction for the equation ' ' a ' ' A + ' ' b ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-stoichiometric at equilibrium . Let A represent the titrant , and B the titrand . At the beginning of the titration , the titrand B is strongly in excess , and the reaction is pushed towards completion . Under these conditions , for a constant rate of titrant addition the temperature increase is constant and the curve is essentially linear until the endpoint is approached . In a similar manner , when the titrant is in excess past the endpoint , a linear temperature response can also be anticipated . Thus intersection of tangents will reveal the true endpoint . An actual thermometric titration plot for the determination of a strong base with a strong acid is illustrated in Figure 3 . The most practical sensor for measuring temperature change in titrating solutions has been found to be the thermistor . Thermistors are small solid state devices which exhibit relatively large changes in electrical resistance for small changes in temperature . They are manufactured from sintered mixed metal oxides , with lead wires enabling connection to electrical circuitry . The thermistor is encapsulated in a suitable electrically insulating medium with satisfactory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermistors used for chemical analysis the encapsulating medium is glass , although thermistors encapsulated in epoxy resin may be used in circumstances where either chemical attack ( e.g. , by acidic fluoride-containing solutions ) or severe mechanical stress is anticipated . The thermistor is supported by suitable electronic circuitry to maximize sensitivity to minute changes in solution temperature . The circuitry in the Metrohm 859 Titrotherm thermometric titration interface moldule is capable of resolving temperature changes as low as 10 <sup> 5 </sup> K. A critical element in modern automated thermometric titrimetry is the ability to locate the endpoint with a high degree of reproducibility . It is clearly impractical and insufficient for modern demands of accuracy and precision to estimate the inflection by intersection of tangents . This is done conveniently by derivatization of the temperature curve . The second derivative essentially locates the intersection of tangents to the temperature curve immediately pre- and post- the breakpoint . Thermistors respond quickly to small changes in temperature such as temperature gradients in the mixed titration solution , and thus the signal can exhibit a small amount of noise . Prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filter ) the temperature curve in order to obtain sharp , symmetrical second derivative peaks which will accurately locate the correct inflection point . This is illustrated in Figure 5 . The degree of digital smoothing is optimized for each determination , and is stored as a method parameter for application every time a titration for that particular analysis is run . Because enthalpy change is a universal characteristic of chemical reactions , thermometric endpoint sensing can be applied to a wide range of titration types , e.g. * Acid/base * Redox * Complexometric ( EDTA ) and * Precipitation Further , since the sensor is not required to interact with the titration solution electrochemically , titrations in non-conducting media can be performed , as can titrations using reactions for which no convenient or cost-effective potentiometric sensor is available . Thermometric titrations generally demand rapid reaction kinetics in order to obtain sharp reproducible endpoints . Where reaction kinetics are slow , and direct titrations between titrant and titrand are not possible , indirect or back-titrations often can be devised to solve the problem . Catalytically enhanced endpoints can be used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small and endpoints would not be detected satisfactorily by the titration software . The suitability of a particular chemical reaction as a candidate for a thermometric titration procedure can generally be predicted on the basis of the estimated amount of analyte present in the sample and the enthalpy of the reaction . However , other parameters such as the kinetics of the reaction , the sample matrix itself , heats of dilution and losses of heat to the environment can affect the outcome . A properly designed experimental program is the most reliable way of determining the viability of a thermometric titration approach . Successful applications for thermometric titrations are generally where titrant-titrand reaction kinetics are fast , and chemical equilibria are stoichiometric or nearly so . # Thermometric titration determinations may be recommended where # * The analyst wishes to simplify the conduct of a variety of titrations by using one sensor for all . For example , a laboratory might conduct routinely acid/base , redox , complexometric , sulfate and chloride titrations . A single thermometric sensor in conjunction with an autosampler will enable all titrations to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titration sensors . After preparation of the samples and placing in the carousel , the analyst assigns the appropriate thermometric method to the beaker position in the carousel . * The titration environment is considered unsuitable for conventional titration sensors . For example , glass membrane pH electrodes must be kept adequately hydrated for proper operation . The use of such electrodes in substantially non-aqueous media as in the determination of trace acids in lipids and lubricating oils can lead to loss of performance as the membrane fouls and dehydrates , and/or if the reference junction is partly or completely blocked . It is often necessary to keep a number of electrodes cycling through a rejuvenation program in order to keep up with an analytical workload . Thermometric sensors have no electrochemical interaction with the titrating solution , and therefore can be used on a continuous basis with essentially no maintenance . Similarly , the potentiometric titration of sulfate with barium chloride in various industrial samples can lead to rapid degradation of the indicating barium ion selective electrode. * A thermometric titration methodology which can not be emulated using other types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by other techniques . Examples are the determination of fluoride by titration with boric acid , the analysis of orthophosphate by titration with magnesium ions , and the direct titration of aluminium with fluoride ions # Apparatus and setup for automated thermometric titrimetry # A suitable setup for automated thermometric titrimetry comprises the following : * Precision fluid dispensing devices burettes for adding titrants and dosing of other reagents * Thermistor-based thermometric sensor * Titration vessel * Stirring device , capable of highly efficient stirring of vessel contents without splashing * Computer with thermometric titration operating system * Thermometric titration interface module this regulates the data flow between the burettes , sensors and the computer Figure 6 illustrates a modern automated thermometric titration system based on the Metrohm 859 Titrotherm interface module with Thermoprobe sensor , Metrohm 800 Dosino dispensing devices and a computer running the operational software . Figure 7 is a schematic of the relationship between components in automated thermometric titration system . A = dosing device B = thermometric sensor C = stirring device D = thermometric titration interface module E = computer # Types of thermometric titration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groupings , namely : * Acid-base tritration * Redox titration * Precipitation titration * Complexometric titration Because the sensor does not interact electrically or electrochemically with the solution , electrical conductance of the titrating medium is not a pre-requisite for a determination . Titrations may be carried out in completely non-conducting , non-polar media if required . Further , titrations may be carried out in turbid solutions or even suspensions of solids , and titrations where precipitates are reaction products can be contemplated . The range of possible thermometric titration applications far exceeds the actual experience of this writer , and the reader will be referred to the appropriate literature in some instances . # Acid-base titrations # # # Determination of fully dissociated acids and bases . # # The heat of neutralization of a fully dissociated acid with a fully dissociated base is approximately 56kJ/mol . The reaction is thus strongly exothermic , and is an excellent basis for a wide range of analysis in industry . An advantage for the industrial analyst is that the use of stronger titrants ( 1 to 2 mol/L ) permits a reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often be directly and accurately dispensed into the titration vessel prior to titration. # # Titration of weak acids # # Weakly dissociated acids yield sharp thermometric endpoints when titrated with a strong base . For instance , bicarbonate can be unequivocally determined in the company of carbonate by titrating with hydroxyl ( <sup> 0 </sup> H <sub> r </sub> =-40.9 kJ/mol ) . # Titration of acid mixtures # Mixtures of complex acids can be resolved by thermometric titration with standard NaOH in aqueous solution . In a mixture of nitric , acetic and phosphoric acids used in the fabrication of semi-conductors , three endpoints could be predicted on the basis of the dissociation constants of the acids : The key to determine the amount of each acid present in the mixture is the ability to obtain an accurate value for the amount of phosphoric acid present , as revealed by titration of the third proton of H <sub> 3 </sub> PO <sub> 4 </sub> . Figure 10 illustrates a titration plot of this mixture , showing 3 sharp endpoints . # Titration of complex alkaline solutions # The thermometric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the production of alumina from bauxite is accomplished in an automated two titration sequence . This is an adaptation of a classic thermometric titration application ( VanDalen and Ward , 1973 ) . In the first titration , tartrate solution is added to an aliquot of liquor to complex aluminate , releasing one mole of hydroxyl for each mole of aluminate present . This is titrated acidimetrically along with free hydroxyl present and the carbonate content ( as a second endpoint ) . The second titration is preceded by the automatic addition of fluoride solution . The alumina-tartrate complex is broken in favour of the formation of an aluminium fluoride complex and the concomitant release of three moles of hydroxyl for each mole of aluminium present , which are then titrated acidimetrically . The whole determination can be completed in less than 5 minutes . # Non-aqueous acid-base titrations # Non-aqueous acid-base titrations can be carried out advantageously by thermometric means . Acid leach solutions from some copper mines can contain large quantities of Fe(III) as well as Cu(II) . The free acid ( sulfuric acid ) content of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titrimetry can determine the free acid content with modest amounts of Fe(III) , in some solutions the Fe(III) content is so high as to cause serious interference . Complexation with necessarily large amounts of oxalate is undesirable due to the toxicity of the reagent . A thermometric titration was devised by diluting the aliquot with propan-2-ol and titration with standard KOH in propan-2-ol . Most of the metal content precipitated prior to the commencement of the titration , and a clear , sharp endpoint for the sulfuric acid content was obtained . # Catalyzed endpoint thermometric acid-base titrations # The determination of trace acids in organic matrices is a common analytical task assigned to titrimetry . Examples are Total Acid Number ( TAN ) in mineral and lubricating oils and Free Fatty Acids ( FFA ) in edible fats and oils . Automated potentiometric titration procedures have been granted standard method status , for example by ASTM for TAN and AOAC for FFA . The methodology is similar in both instances . The sample is dissolved in a suitable solvent mixture ; say a hydrocarbon and an alcohol which also must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to enhance the electrical conductivity of the solution . The trace acids are titrated with standard base in an alcohol . The sample environment is essentially hostile to the pH electrode used to sense the titration . The electrode must be taken out of service on a regular basis to rehydrate the glass sensing membrane , which is also in danger of fouling by the oily sample solution . A recent thermometric titrimetric procedure for the determination of FFA developed by Cameiro ' ' et al . ' ' ( 2002 ) has been shown to be particularly amenable to automation . It is fast , highly precise , and results agree very well with those obtained by the official AOAC method . The temperature change for the titration of very weak acids such as oleic acid by 0.1 mol/L KOH in propan-2-ol is too small to yield an accurate endpoint . In this procedure , a small amount of paraformaldehyde as a fine powder is added to the titrand before the titration . At the endpoint , the first excess of hydroxyl ions catalyzes the depolymerization of paraformaldehyde . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The titration plot is illustrated in Figure 13 . The speed of this titration coupled with its precision and accuracy makes it ideal for the analysis of FFA in biodiesel feedstocks and product . # Redox titrations # # Titrations with permanganate and dichromate # Redox reactions are normally strongly exothermic , and can make excellent candidates for thermometric titrations . In the classical determination of ferrous ion with permanganate , the reaction enthalpy is more than double that of a strong acid/strong base titration : <sup> 0 </sup> ' ' H ' ' <sub> r </sub> = 123.9 kJ/mol of Fe . The determination of hydrogen peroxide by permanganate titration is even more strongly exothermic at <sup> 0 </sup> ' ' H ' ' <sub> r </sub> = 149.6 kJ/mol H <sub> 2 </sub> O <sub> 2 </sub> # Titrations with thiosulfate # In the determination of hypochlorite ( for example in commercial bleach formulations ) , a direct titration with thiosulfate can be employed without recourse to an iodometric finish . : ClO <sup> </sup> + H <sub> 2 </sub> O + 2e <sup> </sup> &amp;harr ; Cl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 </sub> O <sub> 3 </sub> <sup> 2 </sup> &amp;harr ; S <sub> 4 </sub> O <sub> 6 </sub> <sup> 2 </sup> + 2e <sup> </sup> </u> : 2S <sub> 2 </sub> O <sub> 3 </sub> <sup> 2 </sup> +ClO <sup> </sup> +H <sub> 2 </sub> O &amp;harr ; S <sub> 4 </sub> O <sub> 6 </sub> <sup> 2 </sup> +Cl <sup> </sup> +2OH <sup> </sup> Thermometric iodometric titrations employing thiosulfate as a titrant are also practical , for example in the determination of Cu(II) . In this instance , it has been found advantageous to incorporate the potassium iodide reagent with the thiosulfate titrant in such proportions that iodine is released into solution just prior to its reduction by thiosulfate . This minimizes iodine losses during the course of the titration. # Titrations with hypochlorite # While relatively unstable and requiring frequent standardization , sodium hypochlorite has been used in a very rapid thermometric titration method for the determination of ammonium ion . This is an alternative to the classical approach of ammonia distillation from basic solution and consequent acid-base titration . The thermometric titration is carried out in bicarbonate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . # Complexometric ( EDTA ) titrations # Thermometric titrations employing sodium salts of **27;605;TOOLONG acid ( EDTA ) have been demonstrated for the determination of a range of metal ions . Reaction enthalpies are modest , so titrations are normally carried out with titrant concentrations of 1 mol/L . This necessitates the use of the tetra-sodium salt of EDTA rather than the more common di-sodium salt which is saturated at a concentration of only approximately 0.25 mol/L . An excellent application is the sequential determination of calcium and magnesium . Although calcium reacts exothermically with EDTA ( heat of chelation -23.4 kJ/mol ) , magnesium reacts endothermically with a heat of chelation of +20.1 kJ/mol . This is illustrated in the titration plot of EDTA with calcium and magnesium in sea water ( Figure 18 ) . Following the solution temperature curve , the breakpoint for the calcium content ( red-tagged endpoint ) is followed by a region of modest temperature rise due to competition between the heats of dilution of the titrant with the solution , and the endothermic reaction of Mg <sup> 2+ </sup> and EDTA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( blue-tagged endpoint ) by EDTA is revealed by upswing in temperature caused purely by the heat of dilution . Direct EDTA titrations with metal ions are possible when reaction kinetics are fast , for example zinc , copper , calcium and magnesium . However , with slower reaction kinetics such as those exhibited by cobalt and nickel , back-titrations are used . Titrations for cobalt and nickel are carried out in an ammoniacal environment ; buffered with ammonia:ammonium chloride solution . An excess of EDTA is added , and is back-titrated with Cu(II) solution . It is postulated that the breakpoint is revealed by the difference in reaction enthalpies between the formation of the Cu-EDTA complex , and that for the formation of the Cu-amine complex . A catalyzed endpoint procedure to determine trace amounts of metal ions in solution ( down to approximately 10 mg/L ) employs 0.01 mol/L EDTA . This has been applied to the determination of low level Cu(II) in specialized plating baths , and to the determination of total hardness in water . The reaction enthalpies of EDTA with most metal ions are often quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed with commensurately high amounts of titrand in order to obtain sharp , reproducible endpoints . Using a catalytically indicated endpoint , very low EDTA titrant concentrations can be used . A back-titration is used . An excess of EDTA solution is added . The excess of EDTA is back-titrated with a suitable metal ion such as Mn <sup> 2+ </sup> or Cu <sup> 2+ </sup> . At the endpoint , the first excess of metal ion catalyzes a strongly exothermic reaction between a polyhdric phenol ( such as resorcinol ) and hydrogen peroxide. # Precipitation titrations # Thermometric titrimetry is particularly suited to the determination of a range of analytes where a precipitate is formed by reaction with the titrant . In some cases , an alternative to traditional potentiometric titration practice can be offered . In other cases , reaction chemistries may be employed for which there is no satisfactory equivalent in potentiometric titrimetry. # Titrations with silver nitrate # Thermometric titrations of silver nitrate with halides and cyanide are all possible . The reaction of silver nitrate with chloride is strongly exothermic . For instance , the reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a high 61.2 kJ/mol . This permits convenient determination of chloride with commonly available standard 0.1 mol/L AgNO <sub> 3 </sub> . Endpoints are very sharp , and with care , chloride concentrations down to 15 mg/L can be analyzed . Bromide and chloride may be determined in admixture. # Titration of sulfate # Sulfate may be rapidly and easily titrated thermometrically using standard solutions of Ba <sup> 2+ </sup> as titrant . Industrially , the procedure has been applied to the determination of sulfate in brine ( including electrolysis brines ) , in nickel refining solutions and particularly for sulfate in wet process phosphoric acid , where it has proven to be quite popular . The procedure can also be used to assist in the analysis of complex acid mixtures containing sulfuric acid where resorting to titration in non-aqueous media is not feasible . The reaction enthalpy for the formation of barium sulfate is a modest 18.8 kJ/mol . This can place a restriction on the lower limit of sulfate in a sample which can be analyzed. # Titration of aluminium with fluoride # Thermometric titrimetry offers a rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution . A solution of aluminium is conditioned with acetate buffer and an excess of sodium and potassium ions . Titration with sodium or potassium fluoride yields the exothermic precipitation of an insoluble alumino-fluoride salt . : Al <sup> 3+ </sup> + Na <sup> + </sup> + 2K <sup> + </sup> + 6F <sup> </sup> K <sub> 2 </sub> NaAlF <sub> 6 </sub> Because 6 mole of fluoride react with one mole of aluminium , the titration is particularly precise , and a coefficient of variance ( CV ) of 0.03 has been achieved in the analysis of alum . When aluminium ion ( say as aluminium nitrate ) is employed as the titrant , fluoride can be determined using the same chemistry . This titration is useful in the determination of fluoride in complex acid mixtures used as etchants in the semi-conductor industry . # Titration of total orthophosphate # Orthophosphate ion can be conveniently thermometrically titrated with magnesium ions in the presence of ammonium ion . An aliquot of sample is buffered to approximately pH10 with an NH <sub> 3 </sub> /NH <sub> 4 </sub> Cl solution . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 </sub> <sup> + </sup> + PO <sub> 4 </sub> <sup> 3- </sup> MgNH <sub> 4 </sub> PO <sub> 4 </sub> Is exothermic . CVs of under 0.1 have been achieved in test applications . The procedure is suitable for the determination of orthophosphate in fertilizers and other products . # Titration of nickel # Nickel can be titrated thermometrically using di-sodium dimethylglyoximate as titrant . The chemistry is analogous to the classic gravimetric procedure , but the time taken for a determination can be reduced from many hours to a few minutes . Potential interferences need to be considered . # Titration of anionic and cationic surfactants # Anionic and cationic surfactants can be determined thermometrically by titrating one type against the other . For instance , benzalkonium chloride ( a quaternary type cationic surfactant ) may be determined in cleaners and algaecides for swimming pools and spas by titrating with a standard solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate . Alternatively , anionic surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate can be titrated with cetyl pyridinium chloride . # Titration of non-ionic surfactants # When an excess of Ba <sup> 2+ </sup> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxide derivative type , a pseudo-cationic complex is formed . This may be titrated with standard sodium tetraphenylborate . Two moles tetraphenylborate react with one mole of the Ba <sup> 2+ </sup> / non-ionic surfactant complex . # Miscellaneous aqueous titrations # # Titration of fluoride with boric acid # Acidic solutions of fluoride ( including hydrofluoric acid ) can be determined by a simple thermometric titration with boric acid . : B(OH) <sub> 3 </sub> + 3F <sup> </sup> + 3H <sup> + </sup> BF <sub> 3 </sub> + 3H <sub> 2 </sub> O The titration plot illustrated in Figure 19 shows that the endpoint is quite rounded , suggesting that the reaction might not proceed to stoichiometric equilibrium . However , since the regions of the temperature curve immediately before and after the endpoint are quite linear , the second derivative of this curve ( representing the intersection of tangents ) will accurately locate the endpoint . Indeed , excellent precision can be obtained with this titration , with a CV of less than 0.1. # Determination of formaldehyde # Formaldehyde can be determined in electroless copper plating solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and titrating the liberated hydroxyl ion with standard acid . : H <sub> 2 </sub> C=O + HSO <sub> 3 </sub> <sup> </sup> + H <sub> 2 </sub> O HO-CH <sub> 2 </sub> -SO <sub> 3 </sub> <sup> </sup> + OH <sup> </sup> # References # #J .

4 Barnstaple Castle stood near what is now the centre of the town of Barnstaple , Devon ( . When it was built , it was on the western side of the fortified town and commanded a good view of both the town and its important river crossings . A wooden castle was built by Geoffrey de Mowbray , Bishop of Coutances in the 11th century , clearing houses to make room for it . Juhel of Totnes ( Judhael ) later lived in the castle and established a priory just outside its walls . The castle 's first stone buildings were probably erected by Henry de Tracey , a strong supporter of King Stephen . In 1228 , the Sheriff of Devon had the walls of the castle reduced to a height of 10ft m . By the time of the death of the last Henry de Tracey in 1274 , the castle was beginning to decay . The fabric of the castle was used in the construction of other buildings and by 1326 the castle was a ruin . The remaining walls blew down in a storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # Notes #

4 Cricot 2 was a Polish experimental theatre company based in Krakw . It was founded in 1955 by the renown theatre director , professional painter and assemblage artist , avangarde set designer and art theorist Tadeusz Kantor , with artwork in the collections of the National Museum in Krakw and Warsaw . Productions were initially based on dramas by Witkacy , but later plays were genuine creations of Tadeusz Kantor himself . # Background # Cricot 2 played in Poland and abroad . The greatest popularity and recognition Cricot 2 received for its original production of the ' ' Dead Class ' ' ( ' ' Umara klasa ' ' ) of 1975 ; a new theatrical format invented by Kantor . It was dubbed the Theatre of Death , a kind of spiritualist sance , evoking sensory images , words and sounds deformed by the passing of time . Based on his personal memories and experiences of the Holocaust , Kantor tried to capture the collective memory of the Polish-Jewish tragedy of mid twentieth century . Kantor created his own unique visual cannon and theatrical ambience impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon thereafter , his last production called ' ' Dzi s moje urodziny ' ' ( Today is my Birthday ) has been completed and performed by the actors without his presence and the company ceased operations , even though the discussions whether or not to continue without him were split .

It follows the adventures of a present-day , multinational exploration team traveling on the Ancient spaceship ' ' Destiny ' ' over 700 million light years distant from the Milky Way Galaxy . They evacuated there and are now trying to figure out a way to return to Earth , while simultaneously trying to explore and to survive in their unknown area of the universe . The series , created by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper , premiered in the United States on Syfy on October 2 , 2009 . The series featured an ensemble cast and was primarily filmed in and around Vancouver , BC , Canada . A second season of 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first 10 episodes of the second season were aired in the United States beginning on September 28 , 2010 , and the final 10 were shown beginning on March 7 , 2011 . Syfy announced on December 16 , 2010 that it would not be picking up ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' for a third season . The second season of ' ' SGU ' ' ended as a semi-cliffhanger . To resolve this , a movie was planned ; however , due to timing constraints , ' ' Stargate ' ' writer and executive producer Brad Wright announced on April 17 , 2011 that the ' ' SGU ' ' movie had been cancelled . # Premise # The Stargate program has founded Icarus base on a remote planet whose Stargate is powered by large naquadria deposits throughout the core . The team , led by Dr. Nicholas Rush , postulate that the power from that core could allow them to use a 9-chevron code to dial into the Stargate , allowing them access to locations far remote from their galaxy , but lack the means to translate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly . Dr. Rush designs a video game used across Earth to find brilliant minds to interpret the puzzle , which Eli Wallace , a young mathematics genius , is able to solve . Eli is reluctantly brought to Icarus base along with a contingent of guests of honor aboard the ' ' Hammond ' ' , a Daedalus-class starship battlecruiser ; the guests include Senator Armstrong , who funds the Icarus Project , and his daughter Chloe . They are introduced to the base 's military staff , led by Colonel Everett Young , Colonel David Telford , First Lieutenants Matthew Scott and Tamara Johansen , and Master Sergeant Ronald Greer . Dr. Rush and Eli work together to discover the means to dial the ninth chevron , just as the base is attacked by members of the Lucian Alliance . Colonel Telford aids in an aerial assault of the ships with the ' ' Hammond ' ' , while the base starts dialing Earth into the Stargate , finding that the planet 's power core is about to explode . Dr. Rush realizes that the explosion would follow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stargate with the ninth chevron , successfully opening a wormhole . The surviving Icarus Base members flee through the wormhole before the planet explodes . They find themselves aboard an old abandoned spacecraft made by the Ancients , which Dr. Rush finds was named ' ' Destiny ' ' . The eighty-some survivors begin to assure the safety of their team , during which Senator Armstrong sacrifices himself to seal an air leak in one of ' ' Destiny ' ' s shuttles . As the rest of the team works to make the ship hospitable , Dr. Rush , Eli , and other scientific members of Icarus Base start to understand the function of ' ' Destiny ' ' ; they are not able to directly control the ship , and find that it will drop out of faster-than-light travel to allow its Stargate to connect to a number of nearby worlds for a fixed period of time before it continues ; it fuels itself by diving into the outermost layer of a nearby star and collecting energy from it ; the first time the ' ' Destiny ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they understood why it happened . The crew is able to remain in contact with Earth via a set of Ancient communication stones that Colonel Young brought , and are told to continue the Stargate mission of exploring that galaxy , while searching for a way to return home . # Cast # * Robert Carlyle as Nicholas Rush The ship 's brilliant Machiavellian scientist whom producer Joseph Mallozzi had first mentioned in his blog in mid-November 2008 as Dr. David Rush . The ship 's crew believe Rush to be losing his mind , but he does things for a reason . Carlyle explained in an interview that after Rush lost his wife to cancer , he became driven by the opportunity to explore the galaxy . Mallozzi rectified casting reports in mid-December 2008 that Rush is not the leader of the unplanned expedition . That honor falls to Colonel Everett Young . For now . But things could have a way of changing on board a ship manned by a disparate group with very different agendas .. . Although a confirmed main character , Rush was not included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended the character to be very different from any previous main characters in the ' ' Stargate ' ' franchise , somebody who is not the hero , not the villain , and more of a very flawed and complex person . About a year before being cast , Scottish actor Robert Carlyle wanted to try something new in his career and approached television companies in Los Angeles . They offered him several parts , but ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' had the greatest appeal to him as suddenly a drama was opening up in space , and in the past that was something that was slightly missing from the genre . He was aware of the success of the ' ' Stargate ' ' franchise and had seen quite a bit of ' ' SG-1 ' ' , plus a bunch of ' ' Atlantis ' ' . Carlyle accepted the role because of Wright and Cooper 's take on the drama and direction of the show , and he was more than prepared to play the character for possibly many years . Carlyle kept his Scottish accent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the initial character breakdown as a handsome , capable , former SG team leader in his 40s who holds the rank of Colonel . He is like the Jack O'Neill of ten years ago yet has sharper edges . At the beginning of ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' , he has been married for approximately five years and is the temporary commander of a secret off-world base . Young is Rush 's nemesis on the ship . * Brian J. Smith as Matthew Scott A 26-year-old skilled and well-trained Airman and junior SGC member holding the rank of First Lieutenant . He is mentally unprepared for the urgency of the situation aboard the ship . He was named Jared Nash in the initial casting call . Before being cast , Brian J. Smith had been working as a stage actor in New York for a year and a half . Smith taped his ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' audition and was invited to a screen test in Los Angeles . He received the news of being cast a few days after the screen test . He prepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the ' ' Stargate ' ' TV series before being cast , but caught up with much of ' ' SG-1 ' ' afterwards . * Elyse Levesque as Chloe Armstrong She is a stunning and sexy daughter of a US Senator , 23 years old , whose character is tested after her father 's tragic death and the dire circumstances of being trapped on a spaceship . Her father ( played by Christopher McDonald ) had political oversight over the Stargate project trying to dial the ninth chevron . Before the producers settled on the final name , the character was named Chloe Carpenter and Chloe Walker . Levesque 's wonderfully nuanced audition convinced the producers to cast her , as she demonstrated an impressive range in two very different and demanding scenes . * David Blue as Eli Wallace Named Eli Hitchcock in the casting call , Eli Wallace is a total slacker in his early twenties and an utter genius in mathematics , computers and other fields . He is a social outcast with an acerbic sense of humor , and lacks confidence in his intelligence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ' ' Good Will Hunting ' ' with a little Jack Black thrown in . He was the main source of comic relief in the show . David Blue , a self-declared fan of the science fiction series , has seen all ' ' SG-1 ' ' and ' ' Atlantis ' ' episodes . * Alaina Huffman as Tamara Johansen Named Tamara Jon in the character breakdown , she is an SGC medic in her mid-twenties with off-world experience and the rank of First Lieutenant . Friends call her T.J. She finds herself the most medically experienced person aboard the ship after the death of the Icarus Base doctor in the pilot episode Air ( according to co-creator Robert C. Cooper ) . She has a modest background , yet is beautiful , tough , smart and capable , but also has a secretive past with another member of the ' ' Destiny ' ' s new crew . At the beginning of the series , she is overwhelmed by the lack of medical knowledge , experience , medicines , and supplies aboard the ship . Mallozzi considered Huffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly , we would 've been crazy not to cast her . * Jamil Walker Smith as Ronald Greer In early casting documents named Ron Psycho Stasiak , Ronald Greer is a big , strong , silent Marine with a mysterious past who lacks control over his temper in non-combat situations . The character breakdown compares him to Eric Bana 's character Hoot in ' ' Black Hawk Down ' ' . His rank is Master Sergeant . * Ming-Na as Camile Wray Camile Wray is the first openly gay character in the Stargate franchise . She is the IOA representative on ' ' Destiny ' ' and supports civilian leadership on the ship . Ming-Na was credited as a regular character in the first two episodes . She was downgraded to a recurring character from then on until the episode Justice , in which she returned and continued as a regular character . # Production # # Conception # ' ' Stargate ' ' producers Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper conceived ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' as a completely separate , third entity in the live-action ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantis ' ' , which was created as a spin-off from the first series ' ' Stargate SG-1 ' ' . They wanted to produce a stylistically and totally different TV series with a more mature and fresh story approach so as not to get too repetitive . Wright and Cooper originally planned to write the pilot script for ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' during the summer of 2007 , making a 2008 premiere possible . Since their ambitions with the previous live-action ' ' Stargate ' ' series were often restricted by the low budget and risked coming across as silly , they pitched the show as an expensive series to the Sci Fi Channel ( now Syfy ) in the last quarter of 2007 . Although the pitch was well-received , the project was put on hold because of the on-going work on ' ' Stargate Atlantis ' ' and ' ' Stargate : Continuum ' ' , and the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike . The series was given the official greenlight for a 2009 debut by Syfy on August 22 , 2008 , shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been announced . Joseph Mallozzi explained that a new series would have lower salaries and licensing fees than a new sixth season of ' ' Atlantis ' ' would have had . MGM co-funded the project . According to co-star Robert Carlyle , each episode had a budget of $2 million US dollars . Brad Wright pitched the series and its first five episodes to the ' ' Stargate Atlantis ' ' writers and producers in mid-September 2008 . Wright , Cooper , and Carl Binder produce the show , while Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie serve as writers and consultant producers . ' ' Stargate Atlantis ' ' writers Martin Gero and Alan McCullough contribute scripts , but are not part of the regular writer staff . New writers were initially sought for freelance scripts and possible staff positions . Author John Scalzi was hired as a creative consultant , a background rather than foreground sort of job . Most of the ' ' Stargate Atlantis ' ' crew , such as stunt coordinator James Bamford and composer Joel Goldsmith , have moved over to ' ' Universe ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulars ( created for casting calls ) leaked on the internet on September 17 , 2008 . Joseph Mallozzi explained the largely negative initial fan reaction as a passionate response to the preceding cancellation announcement of ' ' Atlantis ' ' . Brad Wright dismissed negative comments as a sole reaction to the wording of the network ; character breakdowns are written to aid casting directors and agents in the selection process , and always sound shallow , and if they 're written to appear ' deep ' it 's just ridiculous . Robert C. Cooper replied to concerns of young age that the ' ' SG-1 ' ' cast was also quite young in their first season . The producers were looking for people who are a little more identifiable and contemporary , with an everyman on the street point of view after being challenged by the situation . Martin Gero considered ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' as an ensemble show , more than the previous two ' ' Stargate ' ' live-action series were . Auditions were held in Los Angeles . The producers were looking for well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast either new faces , or people you 've seen in other stuff but maybe are n't as aware of . BAFTA and Screen Actors Guild Award-winning actor Robert Carlyle was the first announced series regular in mid-December 2008 . The casting of Louis Ferreira , David Blue , Brian J. Smith , and Jamil Walker Smith as series regulars was announced in mid-January 2009 . The casting of Alaina Huffman and Elyse Levesque was announced in late February 2009 , along with other actors whose status as regular or recurring cast has not been established . The cast is American ( Blue , B. Smith , J. Smith , Ming-Na ) , Canadian ( Ferreira , Levesque , and Huffman ) and British ( Carlyle ) . # Writing and filming # The writers started drafting stories for the first season in mid-November 2008 . The United States Air Force and Marine Corps reviewed the scripts .

Air ( Part 3 ) was filmed in and around Alamogordo , New Mexico from late April through early May 2009 . ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' will show computer-generated worlds filmed in digital sets . ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' will have a markedly different shooting style for more reality and immediacy with inspiration from ' ' Cloverfield ' ' , as if a documentary crew were to ride along on this adventure to outer space . # Pre-broadcast marketing # Sci Fi Wire published concept art of the ' ' Destiny ' ' in October 2008 . The first promotional picture of the cast ( out of costume and in casual clothing ) was released on March 20 , 2009 . The same day , Syfy began airing thirty-second trailers of ' ' Universe ' ' , showing various clips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ' ' SGU ' ' Stargate with the first visual effects . MGM revealed its revamped ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' website on July 8 with an interactive virtual set tour of the ' ' Destiny ' ' , interviews with the cast , character profiles and videos . Joseph Mallozzi began posting concept art and behind-the-scenes photos of the ' ' SGU ' ' set on his blog afterwards . Brad Wright , Robert C. Cooper and most members of the main cast appeared at an ' ' SGU ' ' panel at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 24 , 2009 . Behind-the-scenes material is shot for future online and DVD use . # Premise and themes # ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' is set on the spaceship ' ' Destiny ' ' , which was launched by the race known as the Ancients from the Milky Way galaxy several million years ago . Several ships were sent ahead of it to seed the universe with Stargates . The Ancients had planned on using the Stargate aboard Destiny to board that ship when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned the project after looking into ascension amongst other things . In order to reach this ship , an address would have to be dialed consisting of nine chevrons , a possibility that had been unknown in the previous ' ' Stargate ' ' series , due to energy constraints . The series begins when a team of soldiers and scientists from present-day Earth escape through the Stargate and arrive on the ' ' Destiny ' ' after their base is attacked . Many of its primary systems are damaged or failing , and they are unable to return to Earth or even maneuver the ship . However , the ' ' Destiny ' ' periodically stops to dial the Stargate to planets with necessary supplies to repair the ship , and sustain human life . The writers have discussed the possibility that each season represents a voyage of the ' ' Destiny ' ' through a different galaxy . ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' is intended to appeal to both veteran fans and newcomers , being firmly entrenched in established ' ' Stargate ' ' mythology without relying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stargate ' ' themes of adventure and exploration , but focuses mostly on the people aboard the ship . ' ' SGU ' ' is also more serialized than its predecessors , although the writers attempted to resolve each character story within the episode . There was a conscious effort to avoid making ' ' SGU ' ' too serialized , with the serialization stemming mainly from character development . The industry described the show with the buzzwords dark and edgy . According to Robert C. Cooper , the essence of the story is that sort of fear and terror of a tragedy combined with the sense that there is hope for us in the basic ways in which human beings survive . The planned increased levels of drama are balanced with humor to avoid pretentiousness . The differences between good and evil are meant to be less apparent , as the ship is populated with flawed and unprepared characters who are not supposed to go there . According to Brad Wright , the show should hopefully explore the truly alien , and avoid the rubber faced English-speaking ones .

Robert Carlyle won Best Performance by an Actor in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role for the first season episode Human at the 2010 Gemini Awards . # Critical reception # Metacritic summarizes the response as generally favorable reviews for SGU 's first season , but with several critics showing reservation . ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' was well received by several major media publishers upon airing of the pilot episode . Mike Hale from ' ' The New York Times ' ' was generally positive towards the pilot episodes , saying the ' ' Stargate ' ' franchise was catching up with the long-running ' ' Star Trek ' ' franchise . Hale also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Stargate ' ' . ' ' The Boston Globe ' ' reviewer Joanna Weiss also reacted positively towards the pilot episodes , saying it felt like early ' ' Lost ' ' , while the story arc followed the patterns of ' ' Battlestar Galactica ' ' . Mark Wilson from About.com gave the episode four-and-a-half stars out of 5 , saying ' ' Universe ' ' accomplishes what ' ' Stargate Atlantis ' ' was not able to , and said it was exceptionally well made compared to other shows . The ' ' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ' ' both praised the show , calling it intriguing , for not abandoning its premise as ' ' Star Trek : Voyager ' ' did and criticized it by pointing out that the characters spend far too much time wandering a desert planet in Air ( Part 3 ) . ' ' The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ' ' summarized their review by saying that , given time , ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' may become worth watching if it develops its characters and continues to mine its premise for stories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Daily News ' ' gave the episodes four out of five stars , saying that Eli 's not the only one playing a high-stakes game here . Among reviewers who were negative towards the new installments was Maureen Ryan from the ' ' Chicago Tribune ' ' . The reviewer wrote that the gloomy , underwhelming ' ' Universe ' ' seems to have ditched many of the elements that the previous Stargate shows had , notably camaraderie and a sense of adventure , without adding much in the way of narrative suspense or complexity . The only characters she felt were worth following were Eli Wallace and Nicholas Rush . Vince Horiuchi from ' ' The Salt Lake Tribune ' ' , while not overall positive to the series , said the cast and characters were a little more likable and interesting than previous entries in the ' ' Stargate ' ' franchise . Reviewer Laura Freis from ' ' Variety ' ' concluded her review with Sure , ' ' SGU ' ' is grittier , darker and psychologically deeper than previous versions . But so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the show , she called Robert Carlyle an excellent actor . ' ' The Hollywood Reporter ' ' noted a lack of intelligent and surprising stories and was overall negative towards ' ' Stargate Universe ' ' , and even more so on the previous ' ' Stargate ' ' franchise releases . The show has also been criticized for its similarities to the reimagined ' ' Battlestar Galactica ' ' . In its second season , SGU had declined in viewership ratings .

4 George Baptist ( 7 January 1808 &amp;ndash ; 11 May 1875 ) was a logging contractor , born in Scotland and emigrated to Canada in 1832 . Baptist first lived in Dorchester County , Quebec where he found employment in the sawmills there . These were owned by Sir John Caldwell and gave him valuable experience for his future endeavours . In 1846 , he bought a sawmill in the Saint-Maurice region ; which had been owned by Edward Greive , a member of the 2nd Parliament of the Province of Canada . Greive had died in 1845 and the mill was abandoned . Shortly after his purchase , the government became heavily involved in the timber industry . By 1852 , a commission led by tienne Parent was proposing a policy of crown lands grants . Trois-Rivires became the centre of this increased activity and George Baptist one of the important businessmen . Baptist brought innovation and prosperity to the lumber industry and it made him a prime example of the bourgeois class of Trois-Rivires.

4 Chaubunagungamaug Reservation in Webster , Massachusetts , was established in the 1680s for the group of Nipmuc Indians now known as the Webster/Dudley Band of Chaubunagungamaug Nipmuck . For two centuries ( the 1680s until the 1890s ) , this reservation supported a community of Nipmuck . From the 1890s until the mid-1970s the Nipmuck presence on this land consisted of the Morse family and their immediate relatives . From 1978 through the mid-1990s , the Chaubunagungamaug Band , as an organization , appears to have consisted , essentially , only of the extended Morse family . Together with the Hassanamisco Nipmuc of Grafton , Massachusetts and other families and individuals who identified as Nipmuc Indian , this group received recognition from the Massachusetts Commission on Indian Affairs in 1979 . Although the Nipmuck are recognized by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , in 2004 the Bureau of Indian Affairs decided that the Chaubunagungamaug Nipmuc group does not meet four of the seven mandatory requirements for U.S. Federal Government acknowledgment as a nation . 
4 el = No The StavneLeangen Line ( ) is a 5.8km sp=us railway line between Stavne and Leangen in Trondheim , Norway . The line provides an alternative connection between the Dovre Line and Nordland Line , allowing trains to bypass Trondheim Central Station . The line includes the Stavne Bridge over the river of Nidelva , Lerkendal Station and the 2.7km sp=us long Tyholt Tunnel . Construction of the line started during the Second World War by the ' ' Wehrmacht ' ' , the German military occupying Norway , in an attempt to make the railway in Trondheim resistant to sabotage . Because of the long construction time of the tunnel , tracks were laid in the city streets , but neither route was completed before the end of the war . Construction was placed on hold and the StavneLeangen Line did not open until 2 June 1957 . At first it was primarily used by freight trains , but since 1988 , passenger services have been provided . TOC # Route # The StavneLeangen Line is 5.8 km and acts as a connection between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line ) in Trondheim . It is single track and standard gauge , is not electrified and has no passing loops . It is equipped with centralized traffic control ( CTC ) , has eight bridges , two tunnels and no level crossings . The line is owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration . To the southwest , the line connects to the Dovre Line at Stavne . There are two forks , laid triangularly , one each from the north and south . On the Dovre Line 's side of the triangle is the closed Stavne Station . The track from the north branches off just after passing Marienborg Station . The station is built in such a way that trains on the Dovre Line use the one track and trains on the StavneLeangen Line use the other track . The StavneLeangen Line 's northern switch is located 547.82 km from Oslo Central Station , and 2.82 km from Trondheim Central Station . The southern fork merges with the northern fork 1.79 km after the northern fork branches from the mainline .

The line continues through the 2785m sp=us long Tyholt Tunnel , which starts 270 m after Lerkendal Station . The line merges with the Nordland Line at Leangen Station , which is located 3.49 km from Trondheim Central Station . # History # During the German occupation of Norway as part of the Second World War , the ' ' Wehrmacht ' ' wanted a railway route past Trondheim which was guarded against sabotage . They decided that the best way to do this was to build a tunnel under the neighborhood of Tyholt . However , construction of the tunnel took much longer than expected , so instead ' ' Wehrmach ' ' started laying railway tracks in the streets in Trondheim . They planned that the railway would branch from the Dovre Line at Skansen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross Nidelva on Bakke Bridge and then run up Innherredsveien before reaching the Merker Line at Lademoen Station . However , by German capitulation on 8 May 1945 , construction of the railway had only reached Sndre gate . The Norwegian State Railways regained interest in the line during the 1950s and resumed construction . The line was officially opened on 1 June 1957 and revenue traffic started the following day . The line was originally only used for freight trains , although it was occasionally used by passenger trains , especially when there was maintenance work on bridges . The line received CTC on 11 January 1976 . Lerkendal Station was opened on 1 December 1988 , and with the establishment of the Trndelag Commuter Rail in 1993 , the station started being used for scheduled commuter rail services . Ownership of the line passed to the Norwegian National Rail Administration from 1 December 1996 . Marienborg Station opened in 1999 , and from 2001 , all commuter trains operating to and from Steinkjer had Lerkendal Station as their southern terminus . In 2002 , NSB launched a now abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the proposal , trains would have operated along the Dovre Line from Melhus Station and then run to Lerkendal before continuing onwards to Lademoen and running in a loop back to the central station . The services was proposed to be operated as part of the commuter rail system . It would have required investments of 120 million Norwegian krone , including a connection for trains to be able to run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line , and investments to noise insulate the Tyholt Tunnel . In a 2005 report , SINTEF recommended that if such a service should be introduced , it should have four services per hour and operated with light rail rolling stock as a circle line with a tail southwards to Heimdal or Melhus . The report further commented that the new connection at Lademoen would have a 3.6-percent gradient , which would be too steep for mainline trains .

4 ' ' A Walk Around the Hotel Courtyard , Acatln ' ' is a 1985 painting by British artist David Hockney . Hockney painted ' ' A Walk Around the Hotel Courtyard ' ' after discovering a hotel courtyard in Mexico , when car trouble forced him to stop on the way while driving to Mexico City . The painting is one of his more hotly coloured works , being mostly red , with green and yellow , and is done in reverse perspective . The oil on two canvases or a diptych measures 183x610 centimeters overall . It is owned by the Benesse Corporation and is currently on display at Benesse House and Art Site , a contemporary art museum and hotel at the art village of Noashima , Japan . # The studies # The courtyard inspired a set of drawings , later a series of lithographs and finally the painting . In these works , at first the perspective is conventional , and concentrates on the central well , observing points of view from walking the courtyard . The lithograph , ' ' Hotel Acatln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the final work . # The painting # In the painting the detail of the columns is gone , the painter has vanished , but the viewer is presented with a space where distance is abolished . There is cubism , scientific objectivity is gone , and plurality of space is emphasized . Reverse perspective is used to produce an all-seeing experience leading to a visionary feeling . Like a frame around paintings which decorate an altar , it seems to amalgamate real space with the world of the miracle . In his review of the show , ' ' Espace/Paysage ' ' , Galerie Sud , Centre Georges Pompidou , in Paris , Joe Lockard observed that the space of the landscape in Hockneys other paintings is successfully extended to an interior . He says , Hockney attempts and achieves panoramic interior compositions that distinguish his vivid experimentalism . The painting followed Hockneys Mexican exhibition , ' ' Hockney Paints the Stage ' ' in 1984.

514 Fashion in 15th-century Europe was characterized by a series of extremes and extravagances , from the voluminous gowns called houppelandes with their sweeping floor-length sleeves to the revealing doublets and hose of Renaissance Italy . Hats , hoods , and other headdresses assumed increasing importance , and were swagged , draped , jewelled , and feathered . As Europe continued to grow more prosperous , the urban middle classes , skilled workers , began to wear more complex clothes that followed , at a distance , the fashions set by the elites . It is in this time period that we begin to see fashion take on a temporal aspect . People could now be dated by their clothes , and being in out of date clothing became a new social concern . National variations in clothing seem on the whole to have increased over the 15th century . # General trends # # Dominance of the Burgundian court # With England and France mired in the Hundred Years War and its aftermath and then the English Wars of the Roses through most of the 15th century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glittering court of the Duchy of Burgundy , especially under the fashion-conscious power-broker Philip the Good ( ruled 14191469 ) . Having added Holland and Flanders to their dominion , the Dukes of Burgundy had access to the latest fabrics of Italy and the East and to English wool exports through the great trading cities of Bruges and Antwerp . Purchases of fabrics through Italian merchants like the two cousins Giovanni Arnolfini amounted to a noticeable proportion of all government expenditure . Especially in Florence , where sumptuary laws prevented the citizens from wearing the most luxurious cloths on which the city 's fortunes were built , the materials of men 's clothing in particular often appear plain in paintings , but contemporaries who understood the difference in grades of cloth very well would have appreciated the beauty and great expense of a very fine grade . # Fabrics and furs 1400-1500 # Wool was the most popular fabric for all classes by far , followed by linen and hemp . Wool fabrics were available in a wide range of qualities , from rough undyed cloth to fine , dense broadcloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English economy and was exported throughout Europe . Wool fabrics were dyed in rich colours , notably reds , greens , golds , and blues , although the actual blue colour achievable with dyeing with woad ( and less frequently indigo ) could not match the characteristic rich lapis lazuli pigment blues depicted in contemporary illuminated manuscripts such as the ' ' Trs Riches Heures du duc de Berry ' ' . Silk-weaving was well established around the Mediterranean by the beginning of the 15th century , and figured silks , often silk velvets with silver-gilt wefts , are increasingly seen in Italian dress and in the dress of the wealthy throughout Europe . Stately floral designs featuring a pomegranate or artichoke motif had reached Europe from China in the 14th century and became a dominant design in the Ottoman silk-producing cities of Istanbul and Bursa , and spread to silk weavers in Florence , Genoa , Venice , Valencia and Seville in this period . Fur was worn , mostly as a lining layer , by those who could afford it . The grey and white squirrel furs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of style except at court , first for men and then for women ; the new fashionable furs were dark brown sable and marten . Toward the end of the 15th century , wild animal furs such as lynx became popular . Ermine remained the prerogative and hallmark of royalty . # Slashing # Slashing is a decorative technique that involved making small cuts on the outer fabric of a garment in order to reveal the inner garment or lining . It was performed on all varieties of clothing both men 's and women 's . This practice , revealed brightly colored pieces of fabric from underneath an outer garment . Contemporary chroniclers identify the source of the fashion for slashing garments to the actions of Swiss soldiers in the aftermath of the Battle of Grandson in 1476 . Supposedly the Swiss plundered the rich fabrics of the Burgundian nobles and used the scraps to patch their tattered clothes . In reality , images appear of sleeves with a single slashed opening as early as mid-15th century , although the German fashion for many small all-over slits may have begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashings spread to German Landsknechts and thence to France , Italy , and England , where it was to remain a potent current in fashionable attire into the mid-17th century . A second result of the defeat at Grandson was the decline of Burgundy as a fount of culture and fashion . The heiress Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian I , Holy Roman Emperor but died young . In the last decade of the 15th century , Charles VIII of France invaded Italy and was briefly declared King of Naples . As a result , the French nobility were introduced to the fabrics and styles of Italy , which would combine with German influence to dominate fashion in France ( and later , England ) in the first half of the 16th century . # Women 's fashion # # Gown , kirtle , and chemise # Women 's fashions of the 15th century consisted of a long gown , usually with sleeves , worn over a kirtle or undergown , with a linen chemise or smock worn next to the skin . The sleeves were made detachable and were heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by a high-waisted style with fullness over the belly , often confined by a belt . The wide , shallow scooped neckline was replaced by a V-neck , often cut low enough to reveal the decorated front of the kirtle beneath . Various styles of overgowns were worn . The ' ' cotehardie ' ' fitted smoothly from the shoulders to the hips and then flared by means of inserted triangular gores . It featured sleeves tight to the elbow with hanging streamers or ' ' tippets ' ' . The tight fit was achieved with lacing or buttons . This style faded rapidly from fashion in favor of the houppelande , a full robe with a high collar and wide sleeves that had become fashionable around 1380 and remained so to mid-15th century . The later houppelande had sleeves that were snug at the wrist , making a full bag sleeve . The bag sleeve was sometimes slashed in the front to allow the lower arm to reach through . Around 1450 , the dress of northern Europe developed a low V-neck that showed a glimpse of the square-necked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer linen partlet . Wide turn-backs like revers displayed a contrasting lining , frequently of fur or black velvet , and the sleeves might be cuffed to match . Sleeves were very long , covering half of the hand , and often highly decorated with embroidery . Fine sleeves were often transferred from one dress to another . The term ' ' robe dguise ' ' was coined in the mid-1400s to describe garments reflecting the very latest fashions , a term which endured into the 1500s . In Italy , the low scoop-neck of the early decades gave way to a neckline that was high in front with a lower V-neck at the back at mid-15th century . This was followed by a V-neckline that displayed the kirtle or ' ' gamurra ' ' ( sometimes spelled ' ' camorra ' ' ) . Sleeveless overgowns such as the ' ' cioppa ' ' were popular , and the gamurra sleeves displayed were often of rich figured silks . A lighter-weight undergown for summer wear was the ' ' cotta ' ' . A sideless overgown called the ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toward the end of the period , sleeves were made in sections or panels and slashed , allowing the full chemise sleeves below to be pulled through in puffs along the arm , at the shoulder , and at the elbow . This was the beginning of the fashion for puffed and slashed sleeves that would last for two centuries . The ' ' partlet ' ' , a separate item to fill in a low neckline , appeared in this period , usually of sheer fabric ( linen or possibly silk ) with an open V-neckline . Some partlets have a collar and a back similar to the upper part of a shirt . Burgundian partlets are usually depicted worn under the dress ( but over the kirtle ) ; in Italy the partlet seems to have been worn over the gown and could be pointed or cut straight across at the lower front . Two uniquely Spanish fashions appear from the 1470s . The ' ' verdugada ' ' or ' ' verdugado ' ' was a gown with a bell-shaped hoop skirt with visible casings stiffened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depictions of this garment come from Catalonia , where it is worn with pieced or slashed sleeves and the second new style , a chemise with trumpet sleeves , open and very wide at the wrist . The sideless surcoat of the 14th century became fossilized as a ceremonial costume for royalty , usually with an ermine front panel ( called a ' ' plackard ' ' or ' ' placket ' ' ) and a mantle draped from the shoulders ; it can be seen in variety of royal portraits and as shorthand to identify queens in illuminated manuscripts of the period . # Hairstyles and headdresses # A variety of hats and headdresses were worn in Europe in the 15th century . The ' ' crespine ' ' of Northern Europe , originally a thick hairnet or snood , had evolved into a mesh of jeweler 's work that confined the hair on the sides of the head by the end of the 14th century . Gradually the fullness at the sides of head was pulled up to the temples and became pointed , like horns ( ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair was pulled back from the forehead , and the crespine , now usually called a ' ' caul ' ' , sat on the back of the head . Very fashionable women shaved their foreheads and eyebrows . Any of these styles could be topped by a padded roll , sometimes arranged in a heart-shape , or a veil , or both . Veils were supported by wire frames that exaggerated the shape and were variously draped from the back of the headdress or covered the forehead . Women also wore the chaperon , a draped hat based on the hood and liripipe , and a variety of related draped and wrapped turbans . The most extravagant headdress of Burgundian fashion is the hennin , a cone or truncated-cone shaped cap with a wire frame covered in fabric and topped by a floating veil . Later hennins feature a turned-back brim , or are worn over a hood with a turned-back brim . Towards the end of the 15th century women 's head-dresses became smaller , more convenient , and less picturesque . The gable hood , a stiff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder ladies up until the mid 1500s . Women of the merchant classes in Northern Europe wore modified versions of courtly hairtyles , with coifs or caps , veils , and wimples of crisp linen ( often with visible creases from ironing and folding ) . A brief fashion added rows of gathered frills to the coif or veil ; this style is sometimes known by the German name ' ' kruseler ' ' . The general European convention of completely covering married women 's hair was not accepted in warmer Italy . Italian women wore their hair very long , wound with ribbons or braided , and twisted up into knots of various shapes with the ends hanging free . The hair was then covered with sheer veils or small caps . Toward the 1480s women wore chin-length sections of hair in loose waves or ripples over the ears ( a style that would inspire vintage hair fashions in the 1620s and ' 30s and again in the 1840s and 1850s ) . Blond hair was considered desirable ( by Botticelli for one ) , and visitors to Venice reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their hair spread out around large circular disks worn like hats , attempting to bleach it in the sun . Chemical methods were also used . # Women 's footwear # Women from the 14th century wore laced ankle-boots , which were often lined with fur . Later in the 15th century , women also wore poulaines . They used pattens to protect their tight shoes . # Style gallery Northern Europe 1400s1440s # <gallery> Image:Christine de Pisan and her son.jpg1 141011 Image:Christine de Pisan and Queen Isabeau detail.jpg2 141011 Image:Franko-flmischer Meister 002. jpg3 c. 1410 Image:Rogier van der Weyden 029. jpg4 1430 Image:Eyck magarete.jpg5 1439 Image:Van der Weyden Crucifixion Triptych.jpg6 1443 Image:Rogier van der Weyden- Seven Sacraments Altarpiece - Baptism , Confirmation , and Penance ; detail , baptism.jpg7 144550 Image:Isabella of portugal.jpg8 144550 Image:MargaretAnjou.jpg9 14451450 </gallery> #Image of Christine de Pisan in a cotehardie .

Linen shirts were worn next to the skin . Toward the end of the period , shirts ( French ' ' chemise ' ' , Italian ' ' camicia ' ' , Spanish ' ' camisa ' ' ) began to be full through the body and sleeves with wide , low necklines ; the sleeves were pulled through the slashings or piecing of the doublet sleeves to make puffs , especially at the elbow and the back of the arm . As the cut of doublets revealed more fabric , wealthy men 's shirts were often decorated with embroidery or applied braid . Over the shirt was worn a doublet . From around the mid-15th century very tight-fitting doublets , belted or tailored to be tight at the waist , giving in effect a short skirt below , were fashionable , at least for the young . Sleeves were generally full , even puffy , and when worn with a large chaperon , the look was extremely stylish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed shoes or thigh-boots gave a long attenuated appearance below the waist , and a chunky , solid one above . The doublet was often elaborately pleated , especially at the back , the pleats being achieved by various means . In Italy both shirt and doublet were often high , tight and collarless at the front of the neck ; sometimes they are shown higher at the front than the back . Men of all classes wore short ' ' braies ' ' or breeches , a loose undergarment , usually made of linen , which was held up by a belt . Hose or chausses made out of wool were used to cover the legs , and were generally brightly colored . Early hose sometimes had leather soles and were worn without shoes or boots . Hose were generally tied to the breech belt , or to the breeches themselves , or to a doublet . As doublets became shorter , hose reached to the waist rather than the hips , and were sewn together into a single garment with a pouch or flap to cover the front opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by short tops were , especially in Italy late in the 15th century , often strikingly patterned , parti-coloured ( different colours for each leg , or vertically divided ) , or embroidered . Hose were cut on the cross-grain or bias for stretch . # Overgowns and outerwear # The Houppelande , in Italy called the ' ' cioppa ' ' , is the characteristic overgarment of the wealthy in the first half of the 15th century . It was essentially a robe with fullness falling from the shoulders in organ pleats and very full sleeves often reaching to the floor with , at the start of the 16th century , a high collar . The houppelande could be lined in fur , and the hem and sleeves might be dagged or cut into scallops . It was initially often worn belted , but later mostly hanging straight . The length of the garment shortened from around the ankle to above the knee over this period . The floor-length sleeves were later wrist-length but very full , forming a bag or sack sleeve , or were worn off the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called a ' ' giornea ' ' in Italy and a ' ' journade ' ' in France , was popular . It was usually pleated and was worn hanging loose or belted . Young men wore them short and older men wore them calf- or ankle-length . The middle of the 15th century in Burgundy saw what seems to have been the earliest occurrence of the male fashion for dressing all in black , which was to reappear so strongly in the Spanish style of the mid-16th17th century and again in the 19th20th centuries . This was apparently begun by Duke Philip the Good . In Venice , the patrician class , after the age of joining the Great Council , wore their long red robes as a uniform virtually unchanged throughout the 15th century . In contrast , the young men and the famous courtesans of the city dressed very extravagantly . In the last decades of the 15th century , a new style of overgown appeared ; this was of various lengths , generally worn unbelted , and featured wide turned back revers and collar . Short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions and in bad weather ; these typically fastened on one shoulder . # Headgear # Early in the 15th century , the hood remained a common component of dress for all classes , although it was frequently worn around the neck as a cowl or twisted into the fantastical shapes of the chaperon . Hats of various styles -- tall-crowned with small brims or no brims at all , hats with brims turned up on one side for variations of the coif , or low-crowned with wider brims pulled to a point in front -- began to compete with the draped chaperon , especially in Italy . A brimless scarlet cap became nearly universal for young Florentines in particular , and was widely worn by older men and those in other cities . In mid-15th century , a bowl haircut with the hair shaved at the back of the neck was stylish . In Germany , and briefly in Venice , a wide shock of frizzy blond hair was often seen on images of lovers ( and angels ) in the later part of the 15th centuryless often in portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair became fashionable , a trend that would continue into the early 16th century . **24;18874;br # Style gallery 14001450 # <gallery> Image:Livre de Chasse 51v.jpg1 140510 Image:John the Fearless D of Burgundy.jpg2 140019 Image:Masaccio 032. jpg3 c. 1425 Image:Jan van Eyck 091. jpg4 1433 **32;18900;TOOLONG c.1435 Image:Chausses 1440 Cleeves.jpg6 1440 Image:Pellegrinaio Santa Maria della Scala n4 detail.jpg7 1442 Image:Van der weyden miniature detail Philip.jpg8 14478 </gallery> #The lord on the left wears a long figured houppelande with full sleeves lined in fur , while the men of his household wear short solid-coloured overgowns with parti-coloured or matching hose .

7514 Alma Park is a farming area closely associated with the Pleasant Hills township situated about 17 kilometres to its north . It is a part of the Lockhart Shire Local Government Area . While it is listed in some maps and other documents as a town , it in fact is nothing more than an area of settlement that in some cases is referred to jointly with Pleasant Hills - for example the Alma Park/Pleasant Hills Landcare Group Other than private properties that farm both wheat and similar grain crops and cattle , the only obvious indication of the location of Alma Park is an old Lutheran church that still exists on the Alma Park - Pleasant Hills Road . # German Settlement # Alma Park has close links with the Pleasant Hills community particularly with regard to its Wendish German ( Lutheran ) heritage when a large group of these settlers arrived in the 1880s . At the time Alma Park was referred to as Wallendool . Greendale Post Office opened on 1 July 1875 , was renamed Alma Park in 1905 and closed in 1910 . @ @ @ @ @ @

This has resulted in excellent but high-priced treatment which , however , fails to delivers services at a reasonable price to the lower social classes . With only a few exceptions , neither government-sponsored health care programs such as Medicare nor Medicaid cover routine dental treatment . As a result large sections of the population do without . The worst conditions are in Kentucky and West Virginia . Rates for dental services have been rising rapidly , out pacing the rate of inflation . After falling for many years , the percentage of both adults and children with unfilled cavities began to rise in 2000 as did the percentage of adults with no teeth . Increasingly , people with adequate income to pay the fees are forgoing treatment . # Dental therapists # Outside the United States , more than 50 countries allow technicians called dental therapists to drill and fill cavities , usually in children .

Licensure is organized on three levels in most areas . Many dentists must pass National Boards , Regional Boards , and then take a jurisprudence exam accepted by their state to fulfill their requirements to get a state license .

These include Endodontics ( root canal treatment ) , Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology , Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology , Pediatric Dentistry , Periodontics ( gums ) , Prosthodontics ( complicated dental reconstruction ) , Orthodontics ( moving teeth ) , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery ( surgery of the mouth and face ) , and Dental Public Health . There is no specialty in esthetic dentistry or implantology , and no additional training is required for a dentist to make the claim of being an esthetic or cosmetic dentist . Dentists are forbidden to claim that they are specialists in areas of practice in which there is no recognized specialty . They may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and claim that their practice is limited to that area . Any general dentist may perform those procedures designated within the enumerated specialties if they deem themselves competent . Many general dentists train in certain aspects of the above specialties such as the placement and restoration of dental implants , advanced prosthodontics and endodontics , and have limited or heavily focused their practices to these areas . When a general dentist performs any procedure that falls within the realm of a specialty , they are expected to perform with the same level of expertise as a certified specialist and are legally held to such standards with respect to any issues of malpractice . 
514 Familial atrial fibrillation is an autosomal dominant heart condition that causes disruptions in the heart 's normal rhythm . This condition is characterized by uncoordinated electrical activity in the heart 's upper chambers ( the atria ) , which causes the heartbeat to become fast and irregular . # Diagnosis # If untreated , this abnormal heart rhythm can lead to dizziness , chest pain , a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest ( palpitations ) , shortness of breath , or fainting ( syncope ) . Atrial fibrillation also increases the risk of stroke . Complications of familial atrial fibrillation can occur at any age , although some people with this heart condition never experience any health problems associated with the disorder . Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of sustained abnormal heart rhythm ( arrhythmia ) , affecting more than 3 million people in the United States . The risk of developing this irregular heart rhythm increases with age . The incidence of the familial form of atrial fibrillation is unknown ; however , recent studies suggest that up to 30 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition in their family . # Cause # It is associated with multiple genes : Mutations in the ' ' KCNQ1 ' ' gene cause familial atrial fibrillation . The ' ' KCNE2 ' ' and ' ' KCNJ2 ' ' genes are associated with familial atrial fibrillation . A small percentage of all cases of familial atrial fibrillation are associated with changes in the ' ' KCNE2 ' ' , ' ' KCNJ2 ' ' , and ' ' KCNQ1 ' ' genes . These genes provide instructions for making proteins that act as channels across the cell membrane . These channels transport positively charged potassium ions into and out of cells . In heart muscle , the ion channels produced from the ' ' KCNE2 ' ' , ' ' KCNJ2 ' ' , and ' ' KCNQ1 ' ' genes play critical roles in maintaining the heart 's normal rhythm . Mutations in these genes have been identified in only a few families worldwide . These mutations increase the activity of the channels , which changes the flow of potassium ions between cells . This disruption in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of syncope , stroke , and sudden death . Most cases of atrial fibrillation are not caused by mutations in a single gene . This condition is often related to structural abnormalities of the heart or underlying heart disease . Additional risk factors for atrial fibrillation include high blood pressure ( hypertension ) , diabetes mellitus , a previous stroke , or an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) . Although most cases of atrial fibrillation are not known to run in families , studies suggest that they may arise partly from genetic risk factors . Researchers are working to determine which genetic changes may influence the risk of atrial fibrillation . Familial atrial fibrillation appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern , which means the defective gene is located on an autosome , and only one copy of the defective gene - inherited from one parent - is sufficient to cause the disorder .

He concerned himself with an eclectic range of subjects : optics , ancient history , philology and bibliography . His biographers have tended to deplore his spreading of himself over so many areas . # Life # Borel was born in Castres . He became a doctor of medicine at the University of Montpellier in 1640 .

4 Bucca is a fairy in Cornish folklore that was believed to be a spirit that inhabited mines and coastal communities as a hobgoblin during storms . The mythogological creature is linked to the Pca from Irish and Welsh folklore . Rev W. S. Lach-Szyrma , one 19th-century writer on Cornish antiquities , suggested the Bucca had originally been an ancient pagan deity of the sea , though his claims are mainly conjecture . Neopagan groups , principally the Witchcraft coven of Ros An Bucca , have began to acknowledge the Bucca in their rites . In the children 's book ' ' Thomas and the Tinners ' ' by Jill Paton Walsh , Buccas have become fairies who work in Cornish tin mines , granting wishes in exchange for food ( see knockers ) . # Folklore # In 1611 , in the Cornish language book the ' ' Creation of the World ' ' the Bucca is mentioned and some believe that the word is a borrowing into Cornish from Old English ' puca ' . A cognate form in Welsh is of similar non-Brythonic Celtic origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does not occur in Brythonic Celtic . According to the Oxford English Dictionary pwca is ultimately of Scandinavian origin . In 1890 , the Cornish folklorist William Bottrell stated that : : It is uncertain whether Bucka can be regarded as one of the fairy tribe ; old people , within my remembrance , spoke of a Bucka Gwidden and a Bucka Dhu - by the former they meant good spirit , and by the latter an evil one , now known as Bucka boo . I have been told , by persons of credit , that within the last forty years it was a usual practice with Newlyn and Mousehole fishermen to leave on the sand at night a portion of their catch for Bucka . Probably from this observance the common nickname of Newlyn Buckas was derived . An old rhyme says : : ' Penzance boys up in a tree , : Looking as wisht ( i.e. ' ' haunted ' ' ) as wisht can be ; : Newlyn buckas as strong as oak , : Knocking them down at every poke . ' In keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time Also in the 19th century , there were reports of fishermen venerating Bucca with offerings . These included food offerings , particularly of fish , given to Bucca on beaches . One such beach used for this purpose was the area of Newlyn known formerly as Park an Grouse ( in Cornish meaning ' the field of the cross ' ) where a stone cross was allegedly once situated . Similar offerings were recorded on the beaches of Mousehole and Newlyn Town ( the area now known as Newlyn Cliff ) . During the 18th and 19th centuries , folklorists generally interpreted the popular beliefs and practices they found as survivals from or relics of Catholicism , equating such ' survivals ' with Paganism . Some also saw the continuation of practices from pre-Christian times . This idea has been discredited in recent years by academic folklorists. although this notion persists in the popular imagination . There is little surprise that the Reverend W. S. Lach-Szyrma should have interpreted Bucca as the storm god of the old Cornish , equating this figure with the Devil . In the 19th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's End and the Tolcarne River ( main stream at the outskirts of Newlyn ) was bridged ; this area was called Bucca 's pass . # References #

514 The Predil Pass or Predel Pass ( , ) ( el . 1156 m ) is a high mountain pass on the border between Italy and Slovenia . # Geography # The pass is located in the Julian Alps , between the peaks of Mount Mangart to the north and Mount Kanin to the south . It connects Cave del Predil , part of the Italian municipality of Tarvisio in the northwest , with the municipality of Bovec in the Upper Soa ( Isonzo ) Valley in Slovenia . On the Italian side , the state highway No. 54 ' ' del Friuli ' ' leads from Tarvisio and the Canal Valley along the Slizza Creek to Lake Predil , where the route to the Sella Nevea Pass in the south branches off , and uphill to the Predil crest . On the Slovenian side , the road No. 203 runs downhill to Log pod Mangartom and further to Bovec . The village of Strmec na Predelu lies just beneath the border crossing . # History # The road was built from 1319 onwards by the citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prince-Bishops of Bamberg , then the possessors of the Carinthian lands in the north . However , the importance of the trade route diminished after the Aquileia territory in the south was incorporated into the ' ' Domini di Terraferma ' ' by the Republic of Venice in 1420 . Since 1754 the Predil Pass marked the border between the Duchy of Carinthia with the lands of the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca ( part of the Austrian Littoral from 1849 ) in the southeast , both part of the Habsburg Monarchy . During the War of the Fifth Coalition , an Austrian contingent under Captain Johann Hermann von Hermannsdorf on 18 May 1809 fought against the French forces moving from the Kingdom of Italy upon the Battle of Tarvis . Hermannsdorf was killed in battle , in 1851 a memorial was erected in his honour .

4 The Uluguru Mountains are a mountain range in eastern Tanzania , Africa , named after the Luguru tribe . The main portion of the Uluguru Mountains is a ridge running roughly north-south and rising to 2630m ft altitude at its highest point . On the main Uluguru range , 50 villages touch the forest boundary and over 151,000 people are found within the mountain area , often at increasing densities at higher altitudes up to the forest boundary . # Geography # The Ulugurus lie 200 km inland from the Indian Ocean . They are part of a chain of mountains in eastern Africa collectively called the Eastern Arc Mountains , which include the Taita Hills , Pare Mountains , Usambara Mountains , Nguru Mountains , Rubeho , Ukaguru , Udzungwa Mountains and Mahenge Mountains . # Vegetation # The vegetation of the Uluguru main ridge and the outlying blocks is extremely variable . It ranges from drier lowland coastal forest habitats , to transitional rainforests , to sub-montane , montane and upper montane forest types . # Climate # Climatically , the Uluguru mountains capture moisture passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are especially wet , with rainfall estimated at over 3000mm in per annum , with some rain falling in every month . # Water Catchment # The forests of the mountains provide the water catchment areas for the streams and rivers . This water flows mainly from the forest-capped peaks of the Ulugurus with the streams joining to form the Ruvu river , which provides the water supply to the city of Dar es Salaam . Most of the neighboring population , around 3 million people , and the major industries in Tanzania rely on this water supply for their continued survival . The loss of the Uluguru forests and any reduction in water supply potential of the mountains could therefore have a drastic impact on the human well-being and the industrial capacity of Tanzania . # Local people # The local people of the Ulugurus are the Wa ' ' luguru ' ' tribe people . They have been living in the mountains for several hundred years , coming from other areas of Tanzania . The land ownership is through the female line and women are powerful in village life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own the land and make most of the decisions about its use and management . # Biodiversity # In the Ulugurus are home to more than 100 plants , 2 birds , 2 mammals , 4 reptiles and 6 amphibians which are known from nowhere else in the world . In addition to these there are a large number of additional species which are only shared with one or two other Eastern Arc mountains , and hence are globally rare . The endemic species include African Violets , ' ' Impatiens ' ' and Begonias which are popular pot-plants in the rest of the world . # Tourism # The mountains attracts many tourists to the area , particularly due to the mountains ' proximity to the former capital and economic center of Tanzania , the city of Dar es Salaam.

4 birthplace = Siberia , Russia deathplace = New York , New York Abraham Walkowitz ( March 28 , 1878 - January 27 , 1965 ) was an American painter grouped in with early American Modernists working in the Modernist style . # Birth and education # Walkowitz was born in Tyumen , Siberia to Jewish parents . He emigrated with his mother to the United States in his early childhood . He studied at the National Academy of Design in New York City and the Acadmie Julian in Paris under Jean-Paul Laurens . Walkowitz and his contemporaries later gravitated around photographer Alfred Stieglitz 's 291 Gallery , originally titled the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession , where the forerunners of modern art in America gathered and where many European artists were first exhibited in the United States . During the 291 years , Walkowitz worked closely with Stieglitz as well as Arthur Dove , Marsden Hartley , and John Marin ( often referred to as The Stieglitz Quartet ) . # Early Career and Training # Walkowitz was drawn to art from childhood . In a 1958 oral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a kid , about five years old , I used to draw with chalk , all over the floors and everything .. I suppose it 's in me . I remember myself as a little boy , of three or four , taking chalk and made drawings . In early adulthood , he worked as a sign painter and began making sketches of immigrants in New York 's Jewish ghetto where he lived with his mother . He continued to pursue his formal training , and with funds from a friend traveled to Europe in 1906 to attend the Acadmie Julian . Through introductions made by Max Weber , it was here that he met Isadora Duncan in Auguste Rodin 's studio , the modern American dancer who had captured the attention of the avant-garde . Walkowitz went on to produce more than 5,000 drawings of Duncan . Walkowitz ' approach to art during these years stemmed from European modernist ideas of abstraction , which were slowly infiltrating the American art psyche at the turn of the century . Like so many artists of the time , Walkowitz was profoundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris at the Salon d'Automne . Artist Alfred Werner recalled that Walkowitz found Czanne 's pictures to be simple and intensely human experiences . Working alongside other Stieglitz-supported American modernists , Walkowitz refined his style as an artist and produced various abstract works . Although Walkowitz drew influences from modern European masters , he was cautious not to be imitative . Artist and critic Oscar Bluemner recognized this quality in Walkowitzs work , citing the differences between the highly influential writings of Kandinsky and Walkowitz ' style . He wrote : Walkowitz is impelled by the inner necessity : Kandinsky , however , like the other radicals , appears not to proceed gradually and inwardly , but with a mind made up to commit an intellectual featwhich is not art . Walkowitz first exhibited at the 291 in 1911 after being introduced to Stieglitz through Hartley , and stayed with the gallery until 1917 . During the 291 years , the climate for modern art in America was harsh . Until the pivotal Armory Show of 1913 had occurred which Walkowitz was involved with and exhibited in , modern artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lack of patronage . # Isadora Duncan Drawings # In 1927 , Isadora Duncan echoed the lines of Walt Whitman in her essay ' ' I See America Dancing , ' ' writing , When I read this poem of Whitmans ' ' I Hear America Singing ' ' I , too , had a Vision : the Vision of America dancing a dance that would be the worthy expression of the song Walt heard when he heard America singing . Duncan was the quintessence of modernism , shedding the rigid shackles of the balletic form and exploring movement through a combination of classical sculpture and her own inner sources . She described this search : I spent long days and nights in the studio seeking that dance which might be the divine expression of the human spirit through the bodys movement . For Duncan , dance was a distinctly personal expression of beauty through movement , and she maintained that the ability to produce such movement was inherently contained within the body . Abraham Walkowitz was one of many artists captivated by this new form of movement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loftiest goals . Composing thousands of these drawings would prove to be one of the most effective outlets for his artistic agenda due to the similarities between the artistic ideals and preferred aesthetic shared by Walkowitz and Duncan . He was also able to draw from the same subject repeatedly and extract a different experience with each observation . Sculptors most readily recognized this trait in Duncan ; there was a particular quality of her dance which appeared readily artistic , yet not static . Dance critic Walter Terry described it in 1963 as , Although her dance inarguably sprang from her inner sources and resources of motor power and emotional drive , the overt aspects of her dance were clearly colored by Greek art and the sculptors concept of the body in arrested gesture promising further action . These influences may be seen clearly in photographs of her and in the art works she inspired . In each drawing , a new observation is recorded from the same subject . In the ' ' Foreword to A Demonstration of Objective , Abstract , and Non-Objective Art ' ' , Walkowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek subjectivity , but try to find an equivalent for whatever is the effect of my relation to a thing , or to a part of a thing , or to an afterthought of it . I am seeking to attune my art to what I feel to be the keynote of an experience . The relaxed fluidity of his action drawings represent Duncan as subject , but ultimately reconceive the unbound movement of her dance and translates the ideas into line and shape , ending with a completely new composition . His interest in recording the keynote of experience rather than producing an objective representation of a subject is central to the composition of the Duncan drawings . The fluidity of the lines function simultaneously as recognizable shapes of the human body , but also trace the pathways of the dancers movements . Duncan herself wrote in 1920 , ... there are those who convert the body into a luminous fluidity , surrendering it to the inspiration of the soul . Placed into a different context , this passage could function as a description of Walkowitzs art ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stone of Dancing ' ' wherein she discusses techniques to most effectively express the purest form of movement . Walkowitzs dedication to Duncan as a subject extended well past her untimely death in 1927 . The works reveal shared convictions toward modernism and breaking links with the past . In 1958 , Walkowitz told Lerner , She ( Duncan ) had no laws . She did not dance according to the rules . She created . Her body was music . It was a body electric , like Walt Whitman . His body electrics . One of our greatest men , America 's greatest , is Walt Whitman . ' ' Leaves of Grass ' ' is to me the Bible . # Significance in Art History # While never attaining the same level of fame as his contemporaries , Walkowitz ' close relationship with the 291 Gallery and Alfred Stieglitz placed him at the center of the modernist movement . His early abstract cityscapes and collection of over 5,000 drawings of Isadora Duncan also remain significant art historical records . # Notes # <references/> # Bibliography # ' ' A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

4 Foreground-background is a scheduling algorithm that is used to control execution of multiple processes on a single processor . It is based on two waiting lists , the first one is called foreground because this is the one in which all processes initially enter , and the second one is called background because all processes , after using all of their execution time in foreground , are moved to background . When a process becomes ready it begins its execution in foreground immediately , forcing the processor to give up execution of current process in the background and execute newly created process for a predefined period . This period is usually 2 or more quanta . If the process is not finished after its execution in the foreground it is moved to background waiting list where it will be executed only when the foreground list is empty . After being moved to background , process is then run longer than before , usually 4 quanta . The time of execution is increased because the process obviously needs more than 2 quanta to finish ( this is the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process the opportunity to finish within this newly designated time . If the process does not finish after this , it is then preempted and moved to the end of the background list . The advantage of the foreground-background algorithm is that it gives process the opportunity to execute immediately after its creation , but scheduling in the background list is pure round-robin scheduling .

It is an irritant and toxic , as are all soluble barium compounds . It is sometimes used in pyrotechnics to produce a green color . It also finds use in the production of chloric acid . # Reactions # Synthesis Barium chlorate can be produced through a double replacement reaction between solutions of barium chloride and sodium chlorate : : BaCl <sub> 2 </sub> + 2 NaClO <sub> 3 </sub> Ba ( ClO <sub> 3 </sub> ) <sub> 2 </sub> + 2 NaCl On concentrating and chilling the resulting mixture , barium chlorate precipitates .

4 governingbody = State The Oliver H. Kelley Farm is a historic farmstead once owned by Oliver Hudson Kelley , one of the founders of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry . The farmstead is a U.S. National Historic Landmark , which also places it on the National Register of Historic Places . The farm is currently operated as a living history museum by the Minnesota Historical Society . It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964 . Oliver Kelley moved to Minnesota in 1849 , the year that Minnesota Territory was formed . Although he knew little about farming , he taught himself using agricultural journals and correspondence with other scientific-oriented farmers . He became an expert on farming in Minnesota , and he learned how adverse events such as bad weather , debt , insect pests , and crop failures could devastate a farmer 's fortunes . In 1864 , he became a clerk in the United States Department of Agriculture . After the end of the American Civil War , he toured the agricultural resources of the Southern states .

Along with several other associates , he founded the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry in 1867 . He later returned to Minnesota with the hope of organizing local Granges . The farm remained in the ownership of the Kelley family until 1901 . The National Grange bought the farm in 1935 and donated it to the Minnesota Historical Society in 1961 . Today , the farm offers tours by guides in period costume , who invite visitors to help out with farm chores such as picking vegetables , churning butter , and making soap . In 2003 , state budget shortfalls threatened closure for the historical site . In response , the group Friends of the Kelley Farm was organized to help raise money to close the funding gap . The Friends group also supports the educational goals of the site and works for the site 's preservation . 
4 The Solomon , Ex-Lambert Stradivarius of 1729 is a violin fabricated by Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari of Cremona ( 16441737 ) .

Although the Steele and Kramer reconstructions are destroyed by the end of the episode , the fate of the duplicated Mason is left unspecified . As Captain Blue arrives at the ranch house , he is shown to be driving an unmarked car in a long-distance shot which changes to a Spectrum Saloon in a close-up shot . Special Assignment also marks one of the few occasions in the series in which Colonel White is shown to be away from Cloudbase , for a closing scene at the casino . The only other cases are his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Spectrum Strikes Back and piloting a Spectrum Jet with Captain Scarlet in Flight to Atlantica .

4 Edward Lee Greene , Ph.D. , ( August 10 , 1843 &amp;ndash ; November 10 , 1915 ) was an American botanist known for his numerous publications including the two-part ' ' Landmarks of Botanical History ' ' and the naming or redescribing of over 4,400 species of plants in the American West . # Early life # Edward Lee Greene was born on August 20 , 1843 in Hopkinton , Rhode Island . In 1859 Greene moved to Wisconsin and began studying at Albion Academy , a very reputable institution with a religious emphasis . There Greene met Thure Kumlien , a Swedish Naturalist with an interest in botany . Greene accompanied Kumlein on field trips , further developing Greenes interest in botany . In August 1862 , Greene joined his father and brothers in joining the Thirteenth Wisconsin infantry of the Union Army . Though he never rose above the rank of private in his three years of service , Greene was able to advance his botanical studies , collecting specimens as he marched through Tennessee , Kentucky and Alabama . Following his release from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bachelor of Philosophy in 1866 . While in the service , Greene thought of moving west of the Mississippi , a desire he realized in 1870 . With the aid of botanists Asa Gray of Cambridge and George Engelmann of St. Louis , Greene made preparations to study botany in the West . While in Colorado in 1871 , Greene renewed his spirituality and became both a botany teacher and a candidate for Episcopal priesthood , becoming ordained in 1873 . In February 1874 Greene assumed pastorship of a church in Vallejo , California , the beginning of many short stays with churches throughout the Southwest . During these travels , Greene continued collecting plants , making forays into Arizona , New Mexico , and Mexico . In 18761877 , while Greene was an episcopal priest in Yreka , California , he discovered the first specimens of ' ' Phlox hirsuta ' ' , a small flowering plant found only in that area . He eventually accepted a position as rector of St. Marks Episcopal Church in Berkeley , California . Between his arrival in 1881 and 1883 , Greene began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , costing him his congregation and his standing within the ministry . Locked out of St. Marks , Greene gave in to pressure and resigned in 1883 , converting to Catholicism a year later . # Academic career # Beginning in 1882 , Greene began lecturing at the University of California . Following his resignation , he became curator of the herbarium at the California Academy of Sciences and in 1885 , was hired as the first professor of botany at the University of California , Berkeley ( 18851895 ) . While he was chair of the newly founded botany department , Greene was one of only three American representatives to the International Committee on Botanical Nomenclature and president of the Madison Botanical Congress . His controversial advocacy of nomenclature reform brought him into conflict with the president of the university , leading him to accept a position at the Catholic University in Washington , D.C. from 1895 to 1904 . Greene then became an associate in botany at the Smithsonian Institution ( 19041915 ) , transferring some 4000 volumes and his valuable herbarium to the institution for a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his field , publishing his seminal work ' ' Landmarks of Botanical History , Part 1 ' ' in 1909 . The second volume was submitted to the Smithsonian as a work in progress but was never completed , the rough draft being published postuhumously in 1936 . While at the Smithsonian , Greene renewed contact with Fr . Julius Nieuwland , a professor of botany at the University of Notre Dame and a student from Greenes years at the Catholic University of America . Following the expiration of his agreement with the Smithsonian in 1915 , Greene moved to South Bend , Indiana along with his library and herbarium specimens . Greene returned to Washington in October to continue work on the Landmarks of Botanical History , Part 2 . Greene fell ill while in Washington and died in Providence hospital on November 10 , 1915 . By the end of his career Greene had named over 4,400 new species of plants , published 565 original papers , and amassed a library of over 4,000 volumes , some of which have no duplicates in North America .

4 According to Christian tradition , Saint Amaro or Amarus the Pilgrim ( ) was an abbot and sailor who it was claimed sailed across the Atlantic Ocean to an earthly paradise . There are two historical figures who may have provided the basis for this legend . The first was a French penitent of the same name who went on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in the thirteenth century . On his return journey , he established himself at Burgos , where he founded a hospital for lepers . Saint Amaro has also been identified with Saint Maurus , disciple of Saint Benedict , who founded the first Benedictine monastery in France . Around the historical character of Saint Amaro converged many Pagan traditions present in Asturias and Galicia related with Celtic ' ' immrama ' ' and ' ' echtrai ' ' like the voyages of Mael Din , the i Chorra , Snegdus and Mac Riagla or Bran mac Febal . Many features of the Celtic Otherworld are present in the Periplus of Saint Amaro. # The Periplus of Amaro # Like Saint Brendan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoes that of the Irish ' ' immram ' ' the voyages to the paradisiacal islands of the West . An edition of the ' ' Life of Saint Amaro ' ' was published at Burgos in 1552 . His legend holds that Amaro was a noble Christian from Asia who was obsessed with the idea of visiting the earthly paradise . With this goal in mind , he would inquire for more information from his guests . Amaro was not successful in receiving information from them and was quite desperate and anguished about this until one night , God appeared to him and revealed how to reach his objective . Amaro would have to build a boat and follow the path of the sun across the Atlantic Ocean . Amaro took to the sea with some companions and sailed for six days and seven nights until he reached an island . This was an extremely fertile land that was blessed with five cities inhabited by uncouth men though the women were quite beautiful . Amaro spent six months there until he heard a voice in his dreams telling him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he reached the land of a beautiful fountain , where the people were beautiful and lived peaceful lives that lasted three hundred years . Amaro remained there for three weeks until an old woman advised that he leave the island before he became accustomed to the good life . Three days later they arrived at another desert island , which was inhabited by savage beasts hostile to man . There they found a hermit who informed them that the beasts there annihilated themselves by fighting one another on the day of Saint John ; the stench of the corpses persisted throughout the year . The hermit provided them with supplies and recommended that they sail East , where there was a beautiful land that would satisfy all of their needs . They sailed the next day and arrived in the afternoon , finding a monastery named Valdeflores . A monk from this monastery , Leonites , greeted them and told Amaro that he was waiting for him : he was already informed of their arrival by means of a vision . Leonites provided Amaro with instructions on how to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions arrived at a natural harbor where they remained for a month , after which they traveled to an extensive and rugged valley , where Amaro will find what he was looking for : the Earthly Paradise . First , however , Amaro stumbled upon a nunnery situated high upon a mountaintop called ' ' Flor de Dueas ' ' ( Flower of Ladies ) . He remained there , receiving further instructions on how to reach Paradise from a holy woman named Baralides . He is presented with a white habit . This is given to him by Brgida ( Bridget ) , the niece of Baralides who lives in Paradise . Unfortunately , Leonites began to cry : he 's losing a dear friend . But Baralides appears , and comforts Leonites with a gift . She presents him with a branch of one of the two magical trees of the Earthly Paradise . # Amaro in Paradise # In Paradise , Amaro found an enormous castle built from gems and precious metals , with battlements of gold and towers of rubies , walls made with multicolored bricks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earthly Paradise , and thus no living being can enter it . The saint begged the gatekeeper to allow him to look at Paradise through the keyhole . Amaro was allowed to do this , and saw many things , including the Tree of life from which Adam ate ; a primeval and eternal garden ; enormous trees ; birds whose song was so beautiful one could remain entranced by it for a thousand years ; young musicians playing strange and unknown musical instruments ; beautiful ladies adorned with a crown of flowers and dressed in white ; the Virgin Mary , who accompanied these young ladies . Saint Amaro begged to be allowed in ; the gatekeeper refused and informed him that during the saint 's viewing of Paradise , three hundred years have passed . Amaro returned to the coast to find his companions gone and a city named after him built there . Amaro told the citys inhabitants his story and they built him a house alongside the monastery of Valdeflores , where he lived for a number of years until he died . He was buried alongside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hermitages dedicated to Amaro in Spain . There is a hermitage dedicated to Amaro in Puerto de la Cruz , Tenerife ( ' ' Ermita de San Amaro ' ' ) . The town of San Amaro in Ourense province is named after him . His cult was also diffused in Portugal , where he is called ' ' Santo Amaro ' ' . In the districts of Coimbra and Viseu , Saint Amaro is brought pinecones , nuts , and dry figs as an ex-voto offering but he only accepts these items if they have been stolen . Saint Matthew , Saint Simon , and Saint Bartholomew are also brought things that have been stolen . He is also venerated with an annual religious festival in the parish of Ponta Delgada . At Beja , the whitewashed church of Santo Amaro is one of just four pre-Romanesque churches left in Portugal . Some parts date from the sixth century and the interior columns and capitals are carved with foliages and geometric designs from the seventh century . # References # * *

In this volume Brown points out that the likelihood of greatly increased state activity in the future throws a great responsibility on the teacher and the brains and character of the community ; and that problems will arise that will demand enlightened statesmanship no less than reforming zeal . Brown did not attempt to set out his own view 's on the settlements of particular problems . The book was planned as a university textbook , and he held that the writer in a book of that kind ought to be careful in expressing personal opinions about problems of which the precise solution is very debatable . Next appeared the volume ' ' The Prevention and Control of Monopolies ' ' , where he is more constructive , but always endeavours to hold the scales evenly .

At an 1871 dinner of Williams alumni , Garfield paid tribute to Hopkins , defining an ideal college as Hopkins and a student together in a log cabin . The epigram became more widely-known in the pithier form retold by John James Ingalls , in which a log was substituted for the log cabin .

4 ' ' Por Estas Calles ' ' ( English : ' ' On These Streets ' ' ) is a telenovela broadcast by Radio Caracas Televisin between 1992 and 1994 . It was extremely popular in Venezuela , due to its very realistic approach to the day-to-day life of the country and local tone . It was the first Venezuelan program to give a realistic view of the corruption in political life , as well as the first to show the day-to-day life in the poor ' ' barrios ' ' . For example , it showed the impact on poor people 's lives of the intermittent water supply , showing community meetings and lovers ' trysts cut short by the news that the water was on , sending everyone running to fill storage tanks and barrels . It was considered by the Spanish language # History # In early 1992 Venezuela was in a very unstable political situation . At the same time , RCTV was in a low-rating stage . The network decided to take the risk of making a story which took place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Por Estas Calles began as a traditional telenovela called Eva Marina . During the pre-production stage , however , the concept changed from a traditional romance to a more actual , street-related story . The original chapters were wiped and the history , now under its new name and concept , began its filming . The telenovela was initially written by Ibsen Martnez , but he resigned six months later . It is believed that RCTV demanded him not only an extension ( something very usual when a telenovela is very successful ) but also a better ending for characters who were very popular but morally questionable , something he was not willing to do . Despite his absence , the telenovela lasted for another year under a team of scriptwriters , and when it ended it was still popular . Por Estas Calles inspired a rival telenovela with similar themes , El Paseo de la Gracia de Dios , produced by Marte TV and broadcast by RCTV rival channel Venevisin . But this telenovela was quickly recognized as a bad ripoff , was comparably tame and lasted much less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Por Estas Calles ' ' . At the beginning , the main story revolved around the tribulations of elementary teacher Eurdice Briceo , falsely accused of murder , who has to hide under a new identity . But the other characters soon took bigger screen time , and it became an ensemble story . During its runtime , ' ' Por Estas Calles ' ' adapted many stories inspired by news headlines . One of the show 's characters , Don Chepe Orellana , bore a striking resemblance to former president Jaime Lusinchi , who in real life had of course been manipulated by Blanca Ibez . On the show , Don Chepe and his mistress Lucha pocketed public money with one sleight-of-hand move after another , doled out favors to campaign contributors , developed all kinds of illegal schemes to hold on to power , and ruthlessly eliminated political enemies . # Characters # The cast was one of the greatest and most memorable in the entire history of Venezuelan telenovelas . Many actors made their big leap to fame with this telenovela , although some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this production . Some of the most popular characters were : * Eurdice Briceo ' ' ( Maralejandra Martn ) ' ' : the main character . A barrio-raised school teacher who is falsely blamed for the killing of a man . She hides by taking the false identity of Eva Marina . During the soap opera , she was romantically involved with a judge named lvaro Infante ( interpreted by Aroldo Betancourt ) and , later , with the drug lord Sarra Vlez . Although she was the protagonist , she was somewhat overshadowed by the other characters . * Eudomar Santos ' ' ( Franklin Virgez ) ' ' : an archetypical barrio man , who cared only about the present day and had no ambition or working disposition . Eudomar is a very opportunistic man , who knows his attractiveness and uses it as his advantage . His catchphrases que es lo que est pa'sopa and Como vaya viniendo vamos viendo became very popular , and very descriptive of Venezuelan idiosyncrasy . At the beginning of the novela he has an on-off relationship with Elona Rangel , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( Gledys Ibarra ) ' ' : a nurse and single mother , who has to struggle with her daughter and her boyfriend , her feelings towards Eudomar and Dr Valerio , and the hardships of poverty . * Dr. Valerio ' ' ( Roberto Lamarca ) ' ' : an unscrupulous doctor with big ambitions and an overt passion for beautiful women , having many mistresses ( Elona Rangel among them ) even if he is married with a beautiful woman . He is basically evil , but in a mischievous and almost playful way , which made him difficult to hate . His main gimmick was that while he says one thing , his real thoughts were heard by the watcher . * Don Chepe Orellana ' ' ( Hector Myerston ) ' ' : a rich businessman with political ambitions , and a penchant for breaking the law . * Natalio Vega el hombre de la etiqueta ' ' ( Carlos Villamizar ) ' ' : an ex-policeman whose son was killed very early in the story . He then becomes a serial killer with a punisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts on the big toe of his victims a forensic tag with the word Irrecuperable ( Unrecoverable ) ; because of this the police ( ignoring his real identity ) named him el hombre de la etiqueta roughly translated as Tag man . He blames Eurdice for the death of his son , and pursues her . * Mauro Sarra Vlez ' ' ( Roberto Moll ) ' ' : a drug lord who likes to show his powers , and falls in love with Eurdice Briceo . First appearing around the middle of the plot , soon became popular . * The Narrator ' ' ( Toms Henrquez ) ' ' : although the novela has no narrator ' ' per se ' ' , every chapter ended with a famous phrase , usually related to the main theme of the chapter , read by the late actor Toms Henrquez. # Controversy and Legacy # The telenovela was initially received less than warmly . Many show-business journalists placed little confidence on the success of such a story , which was so radically different from both the classic soap opera and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telenovela was surrounded by a lot of controversies , mostly related to an alleged glorification of violence and crime , and with the ripped-off-the-headlines late nature of the story . One of the most notable controversies was related to a boy actor who played a street kid and who became a precocious criminal . The success of Por Estas Calles allegedly drove many independent producers into financial ruin , including the then powerful rival Marte TV , which attempted to produce a rival telenovela with similar themes titled ' ' El Paseo de la Gracia de Dios ' ' . Unlike Por Estas Calles , El Paseo de la Gracia de Dios was not a success , and lasted only a few months . # Trivia # * The theme song , Por estas calles , sung by Venezuelan singer Yordano , became a big hit and topped the charts for a year . * It was the first Telenovela that contained difficult themes such as corruption , drug trafficking , and children on the streets . * While promoting the telenovela prior to its debut , one of the stunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Don Chepe . Many people believed that was in fact a new product , and tried unsuccessfully to find it in supermarkets . * In the 1996 comedic telenovela Los Amores de Anita Pea , starred by many of the actors from Por Estas Calles , many gimmicks of the latter were parodied , like the phrase of the end of the chapter . During an episode , the characters were transported to the Por Estas Ealles era and met the characters they played then .

0514 deathplace = Iqaluit Abe Abraham Okpik , CM ( 12 January 1928 &amp;ndash ; 10 July 1997 ) was an Inuit community leader in Canada . He was instrumental in helping Inuit obtain surnames rather than disc numbers . He was also the first Inuk to sit on what is now the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories and worked with Thomas Berger . # Early life # Okpik ( the name means Snowy Owl in Inuvialuktun ) , an Inuvialuit , was born in the Mackenzie Delta area of the Northwest Territories , near Aklavik at a summer fishing camp . As a youth he , like many other Aboriginal people , contracted tuberculosis and was sent to the Charles Camsell Hospital in Edmonton . Although he was permanently injured by his dog sled he was still able to hunt and trap . # 1960s # By the 1960s , Okpik was living in what was then called Frobisher Bay , now Iqaluit . He was working at Apex , the subdivision where most Inuit lived in the town 's early days , at the rehabilitation centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affairs and Northern Development ( DIAND ) as an administrator . In 1965 Okpik was appointed to the Northwest Territories Council ( 5th Northwest Territories Legislative Council ) . At that time most of the council were from Ottawa . Okpik 's role on the council was to serve as a representative for the Inuit population resident in the eastern arctic . He was not re-appointed to council after Simonie Michael was elected to the council in the 1967 general election . The government of Canada felt that Michael would serve Okpik 's intended role and gave his seat to Chief John Tetlichi the first status Indian to serve on council . # Project Surname # Since the 1940s the Government of Canada had used disc numbers to identify Inuit due to the lack of need in historical times for surnames . In the mid 60s the Northwest Territories Council undertook to replace the disc numbers with last names under Project Surname . Okpik , whose disc number was W3-554 , was picked to head the project . From 1968 until 1971 he visited every community , as well as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Nunavut and Nunavik in northern Quebec . At each place Okpik would record the names , sometimes first as well , that people wanted and would sometimes have to explain the necessity for the names . # The Berger Commission # In 1974 the Government of Canada commissioned Thomas Berger to head the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry . The inquiry lasted longer and travelled further than was expected , through 35 northern communities , and Okpik accompanied Berger as both an interpreter and broadcaster . # Order of Canada # In recognition of Okpik 's work with the Berger Commission , on the NWT Council and for Project Surname he was made a Member of the Order of Canada . The appointment was made 15 December 1976 with the investiture 20 April 1977. # Later life and death # In 1979 he returned to Iqaluit but had spent time on Banks Island and in Spence Bay , now Taloyoak . Okpik spent the rest of his life in Iqaluit and was an elected member of the town council on several occasions . He also served on several volunteer organisations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an illness and his funeral service was held in St. Jude 's Cathedral 15 July . The Abe Okpik Hall in Apex is named for him .

4 Captain Phoebus de Chteaupers is a fictional character and one of the main antagonists in Victor Hugo 's 1831 novel , ' ' The Hunchback of Notre-Dame ' ' . He is the Captain of the King 's Archers . His name comes from Phoebus , the Greek god of the sun ( also called Apollo ) . # In the novel # In the original novel , Phoebus is an antagonist . Despite being of noble birth and very handsome , he is also vain , untrustworthy , and a womanizer . He saves Esmeralda from Quasimodo and she falls in love with him . Phoebus makes a convincing show of returning her affections , but merely wants a night of passion . Esmeralda arranges to meet Phoebus and tells him of her love for him , and he convinces her that he feels the same way about her . He is in fact engaged to another woman , the spiteful socialite Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier . Not only that , he has agreed to let Claude Frollo spy on his meeting with Esmeralda . This decision proves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex , the jealous Frollo attacks Phoebus by stabbing him in the back . Frollo makes a quick get-away and Phoebus is presumed dead by homicide . Esmeralda , being the only one present , is presumed to be the killer . Phoebus , however , is not dead and soon recovers from his injury . But this does not stop Esmeralda from being tried and sentenced to death for his murder . Phoebus could have proved her innocence , but he remained silent . In the end of the novel , he marries Fleur-de-Lys , and watches Esmeralda 's execution with apparently little or no remorse . Whilst being one of the few characters to survive the novel , Hugo hints that Phoebus ' marriage will not be happy . # Adaptations #

0001514 geology = Limestone Sidcot Swallet is a cave near Burrington Combe , in the Carboniferous Limestone of the Mendip Hills , in Somerset , England . It was named after the Sidcot School Speleological Society who explored it in 1925 . A swallet , also known as a sinkhole , sink , shakehole , swallow hole or doline , is a natural depression or hole in the surface topography caused by the removal of soil or bedrock , often both , by water flowing beneath . After Goatchurch Cavern , Sidcot Swallet is probably the most popular cave on Mendip for novice parties . What it lacks in length or depth is adequately compensated for by its sporty squeezes and narrow crawls . Despite its popularity , many calcite formations still remain intact in the farthest reaches of the cave . # See also # * Caves of the Mendip Hills # References #

In 1998 as part of their 30th Anniversary series Dawn re-issued the album onto CD in a very unconventional way , instead of adding bonus tracks to the end of the album or on a second disc , Dawn decided to re-organize the album 's track order to accommodate the missing B-sides as well as adding four previously unreleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiny Fingers one of only two cover versions Ian Dury has ever officially released , the other being Girls ( Watching ) on his 1980 album ' ' Lord Upminster ' ' . # First Mixes # In 1996 Repertoire Records released a 2-CD Ian Dury retrospective ' ' Ian Dury &amp; The Blockheads : Reasons to Be Cheerful ' ' which included tracks from all of his solo albums and many of his solo singles but instead of including tracks from either ' ' Handsome ' ' or ' ' Wotabunch ! ' ' they chose to include 10 tracks recorded in 1974 which they claim are the first mixes for some of the tracks from ' ' Handsome ' ' however the version of Rough Kids is almost identical to the version on ' ' Wotabunch ! ' ' ( minus the ad-libs ) , and furthermore their time of recording suggests it is possible the tracks are in fact from the Raft recordings , regardless the ten tracks are Rough Kids , You 're More Than Fair , Billy Bentley , Pam 's Moods , Upminster Kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call-Up and the wrong titled The Mumble Rumble ( The Mumble Rumble &amp; The Cocktail Rock ) . Pam 's Moods 2 is another mix of Pam 's Moods .

0035514 Intimate partner violence is domestic violence against a spouse or other intimate partner . The most extreme type of violence is intimate terrorism where one person is violent and controlling , generally perpetrated by men against women and most likely of the types of violence to require medical services and shelter . Survivors of intimate terrorism may engage in violence resistance as the result of the violence . It is likely to be infrequent and be conducted by women . The most common form of intimate partner violence is situational couple violence which is conducted by individuals of both genders , nearly equally . When both partners of a couple engage in controlling and violent behavior it is called mutual violent control . # Background # Intimate partner violence occurs between two people in an intimate relationship . It may occur between heterosexual or homosexual couples and victims are men and women . Couples may be dating , cohabiting or married and violence can occur in or outside of the home . Studies by the 1990s showed that both men and women could be abusers or victims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in retaliation or self-defense one time and with less violence than that by men ; Men are more likely to commit long-term cycles of abuse . As a result , the issue is not solely about violence against women , but about violent people or violent couples . It also led to further research to better understand the situations within violent homes . The World Health Organization reported in 2013 that the incidence of women who had experienced physical or sexual abuse from an intimate partner in their lifetime was : # Reciprocal and non-reciprocal # The United States Centers for Disease Control , divide domestic violence into two types : reciprocal , in which both partners are violent , and non-reciprocal violence , in which one partner is violent . # Types # Michael P. Johnson argues for four major types of intimate partner violence , which is supported by subsequent research and evaluation , as well as independent researchers . Distinctions are made among the types of violence , motives of perpetrators , and the social and cultural context based upon patterns across numerous incidents and motives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intimate terrorism # Intimate terrorism ( IT ) occurs when one partner in a relationship uses coercive control and power over the other partner , using threats , intimidation , and isolation . In such cases , one partner , usually a man , controls virtually every aspect of the victim 's , usually a woman 's , life . Michael P. Johnson reported in 2001 that 97% of the perpetrators of intimate terrorism were men . It may involve sexual , sadistic control , economic , physcial , emotional and psychological abuse . Intimate terrorism is more likely to escalate over time , not as likely to be mutual , and more likely to involve serious injury . Because this type of violence is most likely to be extreme , it is survivors of intimate terrorism that are most likely to require medical services and the safety of shelters . Abusers are more likely to have witnessed abuse as children than those who engage in situational couple violence . IT batterers include two types : **28;77176;TOOLONG and dysphoric-borderline . The first type includes people with general psychopathic and violent tendencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the relationship . Violence by a person against their intimate partner is often done as a way for controlling their partner , even if this kind of violence is not the most frequent . Support for this typology has been found in subsequent evaluations. # Violent resistance # Violent resistance ( VR ) , sometimes thought of as self-defense , is violence perpetrated by victims against their partners who have exerted intimate terrorism against them . Within relationships of intimate terrorism and violent resistance , 96% of the violent resisters are women . # Situational couple violence # Situational couple violence ( SCV ) , also called common couple violence ( CCV ) , is not connected to general control behavior , but arises in a single argument where one or both partners physically lash out at the other . This is the most common form of intimate partner violence , particularly in the western world and among young couples , and involves members of both sexes nearly equally . Among college students , Johnson found it to be perpetrated about 44% of the time by women and 56% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which conflict occasionally gets out of hand , leading usually to minor forms of violence , and rarely escalates into serious or life-threatening forms of violence . In situational couple violence , acts of violence by men and women occur at fairly equal rates , with rare occurrences of injury , and are not committed in an attempt to control a partner . It is estimated that approximately 50% of couples experience SCV in their relationships . # #Characteristics# # Situational couple violence is characterized by a few main traits : * Mode : Mildly aggressive behavior such as throwing objects , ranging to more aggressive behaviors such as pushing , slapping , biting , hitting , scratching , or hair pulling . * Frequency:Less frequent than PT , occurring once in a while during an argument or disagreement . * Severity : Milder than PT , very rarely escalates to more severe abuse , generally does not include injuries that were serious or that caused one partner to be admitted to a hospital . * Mutuality:Violence may be equally expressed by either partner in the relationship . * Intent:Occurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gaining control and power over the other partner . # #Further research# # In 2004 , Graham-Kevan &amp; Archer were able to partly replicate Johnson 's hypothesis . However , they identified three subtypes of domestic violence rather than Johnson 's two : CCV ; what they termed intimate terrorism , ( IT ) noting that women and men can both use violence to control non-violent mates ; and mutual violent control where both partners use IT-levels of violence . However , Graham-Kevan &amp; Archer also stressed that their and Johnson 's research sampling methods should be regarded as preliminary : their subjects were relatively few in number and were drawn from known crime victims or battered women , and thus may not be representative of randomized general population samples . Moreover , Graham-Kevan &amp; Archer argued that , by relying entirely on analysis of data from one partner in an abusive relationship , Johnson 's study was incomplete and skewed due to reporting bias . In 1998 , Milardo reported that women are more likely to initiate CCV in common dating scenarios ( 83% of female subjects were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to 53% of men ) . Furthermore , men reported higher rates of fearing they would suffer CCV ( 70% of men vs. 50% of women ) . When questioned about the use of more serious violence analogous to Patriarchal or Intimate Terrorism , Milardo found that women were again more likely to approve of its use against a partner . However , women had higher rates of fearing they would be seriously battered . # Mutual violent control # Mutual violent control ( MVC ) is rare type of intimate partner violence occurring when both partners act in a violent manner , battling for control . # Sexual violence # Sexual violence by intimate partners varies by country and can reach as high as 25% of the women having been subject to forced sex . In some countries forced sex , or marital rape , often occurs with other forms of domestic violence , particularly physical abuse . # Notes # 
0037514 Al-Tro Island Park was an amusement park built in the early 20th century in the village of Menands near the border with city of Albany , New York ; formerly the park was known as Pleasure Island . The island has since been covered with fill and used for Interstate 787. # History # In the late 1800s , thousands of visitors jammed Pleasure Island , also known as Dreamland .

0135514 Leandro Bisiach ( 1864 &amp;ndash ; 1 December 1945 ) was an Italian violin maker , who was born in Casale Monferrato and died in 1945 at Venegono Superiore near Varese. # Biography # Trained as a violinist , he made his first violin on his own and received praise for it . Thus he decided to become a violin maker and moved to Milan to work with the Antoniazzi family in 1886 . With them he established a partnership of exceptional importance , putting to good use his artistic skills and business ability . After having moved his workshop to various premises , he retired to his villa in Venegono leaving his sons Andrea and Carlo Bisiach to continue the business in Milan . Bisiach was an outstanding figure in the commerce of antique violins but above all had the merit of raising a generation of great luthiers , among whom for example Gaetano Sgarabotto , Igino Sderci , Pietro Borghi , Ornati and Garimberti come to mind . His workshop can be considered as the most important in Italy in that period . Besides Leandro Bisiach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Riccardo Antoniazzi , Romeo Antoniazzi , Gaetano Sgarabotto , Giuseppe Ornati , Ferdinando Garimberti , Igino Sderci , Rocchi Sesto , Cipriano Briani , Camillo Mandelli , Ferriccio Varagnolo , Camillo Colombo , Vincenzo Cavani , Pietro Paravicini , Albert Moglie , Andrea Bisiach , Carlo Bisiach , Pietro Borghi , Mirco Tarasconi , Leandro Jr . &amp; Giacomo Bisiach , Iginio Siega and Carlo Ferrario . As is known , after the death of the last great Cremonese Masters after the middle of the 18th century , only the Cerutis remained in Cremona to prevent that memorable tradition from dying out completely . It was the Antoniazzis who undertook the task of transferring the scant knowledge saved from oblivion from Cremona to Milan . However the most important event for the renaissance of violin-making in Lombardy was certainly the meeting between Riccardo Antoniazzi and Leandro Bisiach ; the latter , thanks to his talent , his taste and his business ability succeeded in founding , at the end of the 19th century , a workshop which soon gained international fame . Leandro Bisiach did a great deal of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments from his best period is very beautiful ; of transparent and flexible quality . He primarily used a light red-orange color although it varied greatly from one instrument to another . He had a special talent for creating antiqued varnishes for the numerous copies he made . To give it the old look he very often shaded off the varnish only at the base of the back plate . He used a large number of diverse models but principally those of Stradivari Amatise and other models of Guarneri , Balestrieri , Guadagnini , Gagliano , Enrico and Giovanni Battista Ceruti or other violin makers from Veneto in the 18th century . He also utilized many others as chance would have it . He received various awards and recognition at the World Exhibition of London 1895 , Atlanta 1895-1896 , Turin 1898 , Paris 1900 , Milan 1906 and Brussels 1910 . The shaping of the back , in Bisiach 's instruments , can be identified by the accentuated hollowing out that emphasizes the border , which is rounded . The inlay has a large central white strip and two very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an echo of the Stradivarian style . The F holes are cleanly and precisely cut , while the columns of the ribs are clearly inspired by the classic Cremonese school . Bisiach 's varnishes , usually a beautiful red-brown , have brilliant yellow-gold reflections . - Pardo Fornaciari , Arte Liuteria Musicians who owned Leandro 's instruments include Sebastian Campesi ( Legendary American Jazz Violinist ) and Nathan Milstein : a copy of 1678 Stradivari made by Leandro Bisiach in 1920. # Quotes # The baron Andrea Paganini , grandson of the famous Niccolo , wrote a letter of thanks to Bisiach in 1839 for the repair in admirable style of his Stradivarius . Other clients included Sarasate , Joachim , and violincellist Alfredo Piatti , who trusted his violoncello ( a Stradivarius , from which Bisiach made a reproduction ) to no-one else .

In fact Storioni had been a student of Carlo Bergonzi , the only true custodian of the secrets of Stradivarius . We must say that Leandro Bisiach honoured his significant inheritance , which in actuality was not only symbolic . By one of those tricks of fortune that make one suspect the hand of destiny , Leandro senior had come into possession of tools and models that had belonged to the various old Cremonese masters . This seems strange enough in itself , a curious coincidence . In reality , he had much greater luck ; among the documents and papers obtained by Fanny Rossi , the widow of Giacomo Stradivari ( 1822-1901 ) , Bisiach found the most precious and extraordinary item imaginable , that is , the formula for the varnish of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the only varnish of the eighteenth century that Bisiach could use .

The game was then introduced to the Franco-Mauritians by a group of rugby players who created the Dodo Club in 1928 which enhanced the start of Rugby competition on the island .

The Dodo Club remained the only active club which carried on developing the passion and culture of this sport , but unfortunately due to the retreat of the Dodo Club in all sports at national level , there was a need to phase out rugby from this club in order to develop the sport at a regional level . During these times , many youngsters went to boarding schools in South-Africa and England . Others went to university in South-Africa , England , France and Australia , and when they came back to Mauritius on holidays , there was a need to play rugby and show their friends that they did not only study overseas . This created an enthusiastic rugby atmosphere which led to traditional games between The Students and local players . Between 1992 and 2001 various tours were organised to Reunion Island participating to seven a side tournaments and XV rugby . We participated in the Kenya Safaris Sevens in 1996 and 1997 .

Mauritius rugby needed to be given a chance and the means for development at a national level .

It is also deeply influenced by the readings of Deleuze and Guattari and complexity theory , connecting him to the discourse practiced in America by authors such as Jeffrey Kipnis , Sanford Kwinter and Greg Lynn , and by the reading of neomarxist authors , such as Manuel Castells , David Harvey and Henri Lefebvre , which left a strong political bias to his approach to architectural theory . After these early adventures , he succeeded in transferring his early theoretical interests into a viable architectural practice , as a founding partner of Foreign Office Architects ( FOA ) . The experience of architectural practice shifted his critique towards a more pragmatic perspective and addressed to the discussion of the practice of architecture and the analysis of the conditions of production that affect it : the impact of globalisation , information technologies and organisational structures , the discussion of iconography and representation in the cultural and political role of architecture and a political critique of the contemporary building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theoretical work addresses . With a characteristic sniper-like style , Zaera Polos recent theoretical work has been published through articles in different media , constantly changing position and location to address contemporary subjects in a poignant and polemical manner . His own Scientific Autobiography charts , as a transcontinental , psycho-geographical drift , a gravitation through some of the most stimulating architectural milieus over the last quarter of a century . Recounting a varied and vivid sequence of cultural exposures , Zaera Polo applies knowledge and experimentalism as he evolves his personal reading of architectural theory and practice - not as dialectically opposed entities , but as a complex continuum . Beyond the theoretical work in El Croquis , his texts have been published in many professional publications such as Quaderns , A+U , Arch+ , Log , Volume and Harvard Design Magazine , and in books including The Endless City and Living in the Endless City ( ed . Richard Burdett and Deyan Sudjic , published by Phaidon , 2008 and 2011 ) .

0178514 Sedgley Urban District was a local government district within Staffordshire , which was created in 1894 from the western half of the manor of Sedgley ( the other half of which became the Coseley Urban District ) . The Urban District , formed in 1894 , consisted of the historic villages of Sedgley , Cotwall End , Gospel End , Upper Gornal , Lower Gornal and Woodsetton . The UDC built many new houses within its boundaries as the local population grew . The first developments included the Beacon Hill Estate in Sedgley and smaller developments off Dudley Road in Upper Gornal and Summer Lane in Lower Gornal . These developments were then expanded in the 1930s , 1940s and 1950s . Post World War II developments included the Sedgley Hall Estate near Gospel End Road , the Bramford Estate at Woodsetton and Cinder Road in Gornal Wood . Flats ( not in blocks more than four storeys high ) and bungalows were built during this era . By 1966 , the district had developed into a town due to extensive housebuilding ( private and council ) since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbouring authorities . The bulk of the district was absorbed into the County Borough of Dudley , while the Gospel End area was absorbed into Seisdon Rural District and Goldthorn Park was absorbed into Wolverhampton . The council offices were built on High Holborn in 1882 , and after Sedgley UDC was disbanded were taken over by Dudley council , who used it as a Social Services department until 2000 , ending 118 years of local authority use . It was sold to a private developer in 2002 and subsequently converted into flats . # References # **14;710876;references * ' ' Working Class Housing in Sedgley : 1900-1923 , Alan Aitcheson ( 2000 ) * ' ' Dudley News ' ' , ( 1985-present ) 
0182514 Sparkford is a village and civil parish in the South Somerset district of Somerset , England . The parish includes the village of Weston Bampfylde . It is situated near the junction of the A303 from London to Exeter and the A359 from Frome to Yeovil . In 1986 a bypass was built to take the main traffic on the A303 around the north of the village . The population is 617 mostly living along the old A303 and Church Road , which runs down to the former water mill and the church . # History # There is evidence for continuous occupation from Roman to Saxon times . The village is listed in the Domesday Book for Somerset as Spercheforde . It was held in 1086 by Fulwin from Walter de Douai having been held by Alwakin before the Norman conquest . The parish was part of the hundred of Catsash . In about 1335 the manor was held by Nicholas de Hanyton , while by 1370 it was held by John Lovel of Titchmarsh . The next known owner is Sir Thomas Essex who held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1610 and this family held it until 1792 . It then passed to the Bennett family of North Cadbury . The village appears formerly to have been situated south of the church , rather than to the north of it as at present . There are still signs of earthworks in the field that used to be called Lickhill . Some archaeological investigations have recently been carried out but the results are not yet known . # Governance # The parish council has responsibility for local issues , including setting an annual precept ( local rate ) to cover the councils operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny . The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police , district council officers , and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime , security , and traffic . The parish council 's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities , as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance , repair , and improvement of highways , drainage , footpaths , public transport , and street cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council . The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset , which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 , having previously been part of Wincanton Rural District . The district council is responsible for local planning and building control , local roads , council housing , environmental health , markets and fairs , refuse collection and recycling , cemeteries and crematoria , leisure services , parks and tourism . Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education , social services , libraries , main roads , public transport , policing and fire services , trading standards , waste disposal and strategic planning . It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . It elects one Member of Parliament ( MP ) by the first past the post system of election , and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The present main roads have been important for many years . The bridge was widened in 1815 . The toll house for the turnpike to Wincanton still exists but is now a private house ( The Octagon ) . The Sparkford Inn , dating from the 15th century , was an important coaching house and continues to be a popular hostelry . It used to be a meeting place for the local hunt but this is now combined with the Blackmore Vale one . # Railway # When the railway was built through Sparkford in 1877 , there was a rearrangement of the roads , but the lines of the old ones can still be seen . The track was part of the Wilts , Somerset and Weymouth Railway ( later Great Western Railway ) and ran from Thingley Junction in Wiltshire to Weymouth . There was a station , which served a wide district , and later a siding for milk trains for the milk factory , but both are now gone . However , the track is still in use . # Milk factory # Sparkford Vale Cooperative Dairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1938 . Water for its use was taken from the River Cam . This factory was taken over by the Haynes Publishing Company ( renowned for its car manuals ) in the 1960s and has since greatly expanded . # Schools # The village school was erected in 1849 and enlarged in 1892 . It was for 80 children with an average attendance of 61 , with a master and mistress . It is now closed and has become the village hall . The village 's primary age children now generally go to Countess Gytha Primary School in Queen Camel . Just to the north of Sparkford is Hazlegrove Preparatory School , which is an independent preparatory school for King 's School , Bruton.In early 2011 the village hall once more became utilised for the purpose of a local playgroup . The Galhampton Pre-school re-located to Sparkford due to problems in the previous setting . # Church # The Church of St Mary Magdalene is still as described in 1868 , but the parish is now part of a Benefice known as Cam Vale which includes Queen Camel , West Camel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The building dates from the 14th century with the nave built in 1824 by Thomas Ellis of local grey lias stone cut and squared , with Hamstone dressings . The first known incumbent of the church was in 1297 and the monumental inscriptions date back to Johes Clyke , who died in 1513 . It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building . The former rectory , which was used by the Navy in World War II and then used as an egg packing station , is now used for private housing . The former glebe land was also sold off for housing . # Amenities # Sparkford has a cricket field by the old A303 with a successful local team . There is a playing field for children off Church Road , run by a trust . Another trust looks after Sparkford Hill copse to the west of the village . Sparkford Wood , to the north of the village , is privately owned and is a site of special scientific interest . It is generally opened to the public for charity at bluebell time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has over 340 cars and bikes and is continually growing . It is often used as a start/finish point for car and motorbike rallies . # Local businesses # Sparkford is still a centre for milk distribution . There is a well known sawmill which makes sheds and many other things . There is a camping site near the inn that is a convenient stop between London and Cornwall as well as being a place from which to explore local attractions such as Cadbury Castle ( Camelot ? ) , and the Fleet Air Arm Museum for example . At one time Sparkford had three garages , but one has since been demolished after the bypass was built . Wakes Garage was the centre for a bus company for many years , but the site has now been redeveloped as a filling station and McDonald 's . What was the well known Frying Pan cafe also had a filling station but was redeveloped as a Happy Eater and filling station after a fire destroyed the cafe .

0223514 The Cookies were an American R&amp;B girl group in the 1950s to 1960s . Members of the original lineup would later become the Raelettes , the backing vocalists for Ray Charles . # History # Formed in 1954 in Brooklyn , New York , the Cookies ' membership originally consisted of Dorothy Jones , Darlene McCrea and Dorothy 's cousin , Beulah Robertson . Robertson was replaced in 1956 by Margie Hendricks ( Hendrix ) . The group was introduced to Ray Charles through their session work for Atlantic Records . After backing him and other Atlantic Records artists , McCrea and Hendricks helped form the Raelettes in 1958 . ( Pat Lyles was a Raelette , but never a Cookie. ) # Second lineup # In 1961 , a new version of the Cookies emerged in New York , with Dorothy Jones joining newcomers Earl-Jean McCrea ( Darlene 's younger sister ) and another of Dorothy 's cousins , Margaret Ross . Jones also recorded one solo recording for Columbia in 1961 . This trio had the greatest success as the Cookies : under their own name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sedaka 's hit songs Breaking Up is Hard to Do , The Dreamer and Bad Girl ; and recording demos for Aldon Music , under the direction of Carole King and Gerry Goffin .

They scored their biggest hit in 1963 with the song Do n't Say Nothin ' Bad ( About My Baby ) , which reached #3 on the ' ' Billboard ' ' R&amp;B chart and #7 on the ' ' Billboard ' ' Pop chart . A 1962 hit , Chains , was later recorded by the Beatles .

0254514 The General Certificate of Education Advanced Level generally termed the GCE Advanced Level or , more commonly , the A Level is a school leaving qualification offered by educational bodies in the United Kingdom and the British Crown dependencies to students completing secondary or pre-university education . A number of countries , including Singapore and Mauritius have developed qualifications with the same name as and a similar format to the British A Levels . The qualification is generally studied for over two years and split into two parts , with one part studied in each year . The first part is known as the Advanced Subsidiary Level , or AS Level , and was previously known as the Advanced Supplementary Level , with the same abbreviation . The second part is known as the A2 Level . The AS Level is a qualification in its own right , and the AS Level combined with the A2 Level forms the complete A Level qualification . # Current usage # A number of countries use the A Levels as a school leaving qualification .

Compared to the usual 2530% rate of achieving an A-grade in the UK AS/A2 , there could be statistically fewer than 0.05% candidates scoring an A in a single examination in the Hong Kong Advanced Supplementary Level Examination and less than 1% rate of achieving an A-grade every year in an A Level subject .

Moreover , it is important to note that because of the significantly different measurement methodologies , these examinations are not directly comparable in terms of the skills and knowledge demonstrated at each grade and that distinction rates alone can not serve as a fair indicator of one 's absolute academic performance . In that NARIC research , only the cumulative percentages were taken into account to reach the huge generalisations , on the very unsafe assumption that two scales are exactly identical and standardised . The wide recognition for both qualifications in many local universities and companies all attests to this . For example , many prestigious overseas universities regard the HK qualifications ( HKCEE and HKALE ) as being equivalent to the UK ones ( IGCSE and GCEAL ) on a grade-by-grade basis

0344514 Emma Margarete Gretchen Dessoff ( 11 June 1874 27 November 1944 ) was a German choral conductor , singer , and voice teacher . # Life # # Germany # Margarete ( sometimes incorrectly spelled Margarethe ) Dessoff was born in Vienna and came to Frankfurt am Main when she was six years old , her father ( Felix Otto Dessoff ) having been appointed conductor of the Frankfurt Opera House . Margarete Dessoff studied voice with Gustav Gunz und Marie Schrder-Hanfstngl ( 189297 ) at Dr. Hoch 's Konservatorium in Frankfurt and from 1912 directed the women 's chorus there . Dessoff 's singing career was cut short when a famous opera singer ( probably Hanfstngl ) teaching at Dr. Hoch 's apparently ruined her voice . She regained it through private lessons ( with Jenny Hahn , a pupil of Julius Stockhausen ) , but had she not lost her voice she might never have become a well-known and well-loved choral director .

As a boy , Mr. Warburg came to know Margarete Dessoff from visits to his uncle 's house , and it was this friendship which moved him to bring her to America for a holiday following the strain of the First World War . The Institute of Musical Art ( later Juilliard School of Music ) in New York had been founded in 1905 with the European conservatories as its model . Earlier , many young musicians had felt the need to study in Europe : American Edward MacDowell and Australian Percy Grainger both studied at the Konservatorium in Frankfurt .

She founded various other choirs in the 20 's : in 1924 with Angela Diller , she formed the ' ' Adesdi Chorus of Women 's Voices ' ' , with the name Adesdi being formed from parts of each of the founders ' name ; then in 1929 she founded a mixed voice choir , ' ' The New York A Cappella Singers ' ' , and in 1930 these two became The Dessoff Choirs which meant that both choirs gave their concerts together with programs that contained pieces for women 's voices ( sung by Adesdi ) and for mixed voices ( sung by the ' ' New York A Cappella Singers ' ' ) . She also founded the ' ' Vecchi Singers ' ' with whom she conducted the first American performance of Orazio Vecchi 's ' ' L'Amfiparnaso ' ' in 1933 .

0420514 The Byelorussian Military District ( alternative spelling Belorussian ) was a military district of the Soviet Armed Forces . Originally in the times of Russian Civil War it formed as the Western Front , and in April 1924 it was renamed to the Western Military District . In October 1926 it was redesignated the Belorussian Military District , with its staff in Smolensk . It covered the territory of the Byelorussian SSR and the western part of the RSFSR ( including Smolensk area , Bryansk area , and parts of Kaluga area ) . In 1928 , the first maneuvers of troops of the district were held , which was attended by 6th Cavalry Division and 7th Cavalry Division , 5th , 8th and 27th Rifle Divisions , 33rd territorial division , a tank brigade of the Moscow Military District , artillery , aviation , communication , and engineering units . The exercises showed growth in the combat skills of troops , which attended the People 's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs , Kliment Voroshilov . In 1932 it deployed from within the country the 4th Leningrad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgy Zhukov . In 1932-1933 , in connection with the development of armored vehicles , it formed seven separate tank brigades , armed with Soviet-made tanks : light T-24 , T-26 , medium T-28 , fast BT-2 , BT-5 , floating T-37 , heavy T-35 , slipper T-27 . In 1937 the district deployed 15 infantry divisions , grouped into five infantry corps and five cavalry divisions . On 26 July 1938 , the district was renamed the Belarussian Special Military District ( ) . After the Soviet/German invasion of Poland in September 1939 , it took in most of the former Polish area and was redesignated the Belorussian Special Military District . In July 1940 , it was redesignated the Western Special Military District . When the German invasion , Operation Barbarossa , began on 22 June 1941 the district was again redesignated the Western Front . The district was reformed in October 1943 from the staff of the Moscow Zone of Defense ( at Smolensk , which moved to Minsk in August , 1944 ) .

The district covered the territory of the Byelorussian SSR . From mid February 1949 , in accordance with a directive issued 10 January 1949 , the 1st Air Army , present within the district , was redesignated the 26th Air Army . The 26th Air Army was subordinate to the BVO . In 1962 the 26th Air Army comprised the 95th Fighter Aviation Division ( Shchuchin , Grodno Oblast ) , the 1st Guards Fighter-Bomber Aviation Division ( Lida , Grodno Oblast ) , and three separate smaller units : the 10th independent Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment ( Shchuchin , Grodno Oblast ) , the 248th independent Mixed Aviation Squadron ( Minsk-Lipki , Minsk Oblast ) , and the 95th independent Mixed Aviation Squadron ( Grodno , Grodno Oblast ) .

The 120th ' Rogachev ' Guards Motorised Rifle Division , subordinated directly to district control , was the district 's most prestigious division . Also present was the 51st Guards Artillery Division . Air defence was provided in the 1980s by the 2nd Air Defence Army of the Soviet Air Defence Forces ( PVO ) which included 11th and 28th PVO Corps .

0476514 An Application Delivery Network ( ADN ) is a suite of technologies that , when deployed together , provide application availability , security , visibility , and acceleration . Gartner defines Application Delivery Networking as the combination of WAN Optimization Controllers ( WOCs ) and Application Delivery Controllers ( ADCs ) . At the data center end of an ADN is the Application Delivery Controller ( ADC ) , an advanced traffic management device that is often also referred to as a web switch , content switch , or multilayer switch , the purpose of which is to distribute traffic among a number of servers or geographically dislocated sites based on application specific criteria . In the branch office portion of an ADN is the WAN optimization controller , which uses objectless caching techniques The ADC , one component of an ADN , evolved from layer 4-7 switches in the late 1990s when it became apparent that traditional load balancing techniques were not robust enough to handle the increasingly complex mix of application traffic being delivered over a wider variety of network connectivity options . # Application delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle . This principle keeps the core network relatively simple and moves the intelligence as much as possible to the network end-points : the hosts and clients . An Application Delivery Network ( ADN ) enhances the delivery of applications across the Internet by employing a number of optimization techniques . Many of these techniques are based on established best-practices employed to efficiently route traffic at the network layer including redundancy and load balancing In theory , an Application Delivery Network ( ADN ) is closely related to a content delivery network . The difference between the two delivery networks lies in the intelligence of the ADN to understand and optimize applications , usually referred to as application fluency . Application Fluent Network ( AFN ) is based upon the concept of Application Fluency to refer to WAN optimization techniques applied at Layer Four to Layer Seven of the OSI model for networks . Application Fluency implies that the network is fluent or intelligent in understanding and being able to optimize delivery of each application . Application Fluent Network is an addition of SDN capabilities . The acronym ' AFN ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fluent Network . Application delivery uses one or more layer 47 switches , also known as a web switch , content switch , or multilayer switch to intelligently distribute traffic to a pool , also known as a cluster or farm , of servers . The application delivery controller ( ADC ) is assigned a single virtual IP address ( VIP ) that represents the pool of servers . Traffic arriving at the ADC is then directed to one of the servers in the pool ( cluster , farm ) based on a number of factors including application specific data values , application transport protocol , availability of servers , current performance metrics , and client-specific parameters . An ADN provides the advantages of load distribution , increase in capacity of servers , improved scalability , security , and increased reliability through application specific health checks . Increasingly the ADN comprises a redundant pair of ADC on which is integrated a number of different feature sets designed to provide security , availability , reliability , and acceleration functions . In some cases these devices are still separate entities , deployed together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered , each providing specific functionality that enhances the delivery of the application . # ADN optimization techniques # # TCP multiplexing # TCP Multiplexing is loosely based on established connection pooling techniques utilized by application server platforms to optimize the execution of database queries from within applications . An ADC establishes a number of connections to the servers in its pool and keeps the connections open . When a request is received by the ADC from the client , the request is evaluated and then directed to a server over an existing connection . This has the effect of reducing the overhead imposed by establishing and tearing down the TCP connection with the server , improving the responsiveness of the application . Some ADN implementations take this technique one step further and also multiplex HTTP and application requests . This has the benefit of executing requests in parallel , which enhances the performance of the application . # TCP optimization # There are a number of RFCs which describe mechanisms for improving the performance of TCP . Many ADN implement these RFCs in order to provide enhanced delivery of applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly implemented are : * Delayed Acknowledgements * Nagle Algorithm * Selective Acknowledgements * Explicit Congestion Notification ECN * Limited and Fast Retransmits * Adaptive Initial Congestion Windows # Data compression and caching # ADNs also provide optimization of application data through caching and compression techniques . There are two types of compression used by ADNs today : industry standard HTTP compression and proprietary data reduction algorithms . It is important to note that the cost in CPU cycles to compress data when traversing a LAN can result in a negative performance impact and therefore best practices are to only utilize compression when delivering applications via a WAN or particularly congested high-speed data link . HTTP compression is asymmetric and transparent to the client . Support for HTTP compression is built into web servers and web browsers . All commercial ADN products currently support HTTP compression . A second compression technique is achieved through data reduction algorithms . Because these algorithms are proprietary and modify the application traffic , they are symmetric and require a device to reassemble the application traffic before the client can receive it . A separate class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide this functionality , but the technology has been slowly added to the ADN portfolio over the past few years as this class of device continues to become more application aware , providing additional features for specific applications such as CIFS and SMB. # ADN reliability and availability techniques # # Advanced health checking # Advanced health checking is the ability of an ADN to determine not only the state of the server on which an application is hosted , but the status of the application it is delivering . Advanced health checking techniques allow the ADC to intelligently determine whether or not the content being returned by the server is correct and should be delivered to the client . This feature enables other reliability features in the ADN , such as resending a request to a different server if the content returned by the original server is found to be erroneous . # Load balancing algorithms # The load balancing algorithms found in today 's ADN are far more advanced than the simplistic round-robin and least connections algorithms used in the early 1990s . These algorithms were originally loosely based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolved to factor in conditions peculiar to networking and application environments . It is more accurate to describe today 's load balancing algorithms as application routing algorithms , as most ADN employ application awareness to determine whether an application is available to respond to a request . This includes the ability of the ADN to determine not only whether the application is available , but whether or not the application can respond to the request within specified parameters , often referred to as an service level agreement . Typical industry standard load balancing algorithms available today include : * Round Robin * Least Connections * Fastest Response Time * Weighted Round Robin * Weighted Least Connections * Custom values assigned to individual servers in a pool based on SNMP or other communication mechanism # Fault tolerance # The ADN provides fault tolerance at the server level , within pools or farms . This is accomplished by designating specific servers as a ' backup ' that is activated automatically by the ADN in the event that the primary server(s) in the pool fail . The ADN also ensures application availability and reliability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the event of a hardware or software failure . This ensures that traffic continues to flow in the event of a failure in one device , thereby providing fault tolerance for the applications . Fault tolerance is implemented in ADNs through either a network or serial based connection . # #Network based failover# # The Virtual IP Address ( VIP ) is shared between two devices . A heartbeat daemon on the secondary device verifies that the primary device is active . In the event that the heartbeat is lost , the secondary device assumes the shared VIP and begins servicing requests . This process is not immediate , and though most ADN replicate sessions from the primary to the secondary , there is no way to guarantee that sessions initiated during the time it takes for the secondary to assume the VIP and begin managing traffic will be maintained . # #Serial based failover# # In a serial connection based failover configuration two ADN devices communicate via a standard RS232 connection instead of the network , and all sharing of session information and status is exchanged over this connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same constraints regarding sessions initiated while the primary device is failing as network based failover. # ADN security # # Transport layer security # Although often erroneously assigned to the application layer , Transport Layer Security # Application layer security # # #Resource cloaking# # The use of a virtual IP address ( VIP ) and position of the ADN in the network provides the means through which certain resources can be cloaked , or hidden , from the client . Because the ADN is designed to understand applications and application protocols , such as HTTP , it can manipulate certain aspects of the protocol to cloak the servers in the pool and prevent potentially useful information regarding the software and hardware infrastructure from being exposed . A typical use of this functionality is to hide the operating system and server software used to host the application . This is usually accomplished by rewriting the Server field in an HTTP response . A second typical use of this functionality is the exploitation of the ADN 's ability to rewrite the URI portion of an HTTP request . The client is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ADN , and upon receiving the request the ADN may either ( a ) rewrite the URI and send a 302 redirect or ( b ) transparently translates the URI and responds to the client as if the URI were the right one in the first place . # #Application firewall# # In recent years commercial ADNs have begun to include application firewall functionality to further secure applications during the delivery process . This is a hotly debated subject with many security professionals arguing that the functionality included in an application firewall are unnecessary and should be handled by the application while others consider employing as much security as possible , regardless of position in the delivery network , to be the best practice . Many commercial ADN companies have acquired and integrated these functions and present such features as part of a defense in depth strategy often cited by security professionals . # Network layer security # The ADN is most often deployed in the DMZ at the edge of the network . This results in exposure to potential network layer attacks including Denial of Service ( DoS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ADN must necessarily protect not only itself but the applications it is delivering from succumbing to such attacks . The ADN generally employs a number of protections against typical network layer attacks though it does not implement the full security offered by an IPS .

Some application switches and routers delay binding the client session to the server until the proper handshakes are complete so as to prevent Denial of Service attacks . # #IP filtering# # ADNs often have the ability to filter traffic based on Access Control Lists ( ACLs ) , Bogus IP ranges ( Bogon filtering ) and deep packet inspection pattern matching .

0492514 Derinkuyu Underground City is an ancient multi-level underground city of the Median Empire in the Derinkuyu district in Nevehir Province , Turkey . Extending to a depth of approximately 60 m , it was large enough to shelter approximately 20,000 people together with their livestock and food stores . It is the largest excavated underground city in Turkey and is one of several underground complexes found across Cappadocia . It was opened to visitors in 1969 and to date , about half of the underground city is accessible to tourists . # Features # The underground city at Derinkuyu could be closed from the inside with large stone doors . Each floor could be closed off separately . The city could accommodate up to 20,000 people and had all the usual amenities found in other underground complexes Between the third and fourth levels is a vertical staircase . This passage way leads to a cruciform church on the lowest ( fifth ) level . The large 55 m ventilation shaft appears to have been used as a well . The shaft also provided water to both the villagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to those in hiding . # History # First built in the soft volcanic rock of the Cappadocia region , possibly by the Phrygians in the 8th7th centuries B.C. according to the Turkish Department of Culture , the underground city at Derinkuyu may have been enlarged in the Byzantine era . During the Persian Achaemenid empire the city was used as a refugee settlement . There are references to underground refugee settlements built by the Persian king Yima in the second chapter of the Zoroastrian book ' ' Vendidad ' ' . Therefore , many scholars believe that the city may have been built by the Persians . The city was connected with other underground cities through miles of tunnels . Some artifacts discovered in these underground settlements belong to the Middle Byzantine Period , between the 5th and the 10th centuries A.D. The tunnels were rediscovered in 1963 , after a resident of the area found a mysterious room behind a wall in his home . Further digging revealed access to the tunnel network . # Other underground cities # Nevehir Province has several other historical underground cities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The underground cities and structures are carved out of unique geological formations . They may have been used as hiding places during times of raids . The locations are now archaeological tourist attractions . They remain generally unoccupied . In excess of 200 underground cities containing a minimum of two levels have been discovered in the area between Kayseri and Nevsehir . Some 40 of those contain a minimum of three levels or more . The cities at Kaymakl and Derinkuyu are two of the best examples of habitable underground structures .

0552514 Faxton is an abandoned village and chapelry in the county of Northamptonshire in England . Nearby are the villages of Old , Lamport and Mawsley and the Northampton &amp; Lamport Railway . It is believed that the name ' ' Faxton ' ' comes from the Scandinavian ' ' Fakr ' ' and the Anglo-Saxon ' ' tun ' ' , meaning ' ' Fakr 's Farm ' ' . This would indicate that Faxton grew from a Viking or Norse settler 's farmstead and therefore would date from approximately the 9th century The Domesday Book , naming Faxton as the Manor of ' ' Fextone ' ' , notes that the population was of approximately 60 to 80 people . The village is documented as having consisted of a church , a rectory , a hall , an aviary , almshouses and a number of ponds . Lady Danvers founded the parish 's almshouses for four persons and , six years later , Jane Kemsey bequeathed 100 to it . Archaeological evidence has been found of settlement at Faxton as early as around 1200 . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London in 1665 , a family relocated to Faxton with their servants , one of whom carried the fatal disease which spread and almost wiped out the village . However , this tale is disproved by comparing the number of householders recorded in the hearth tax lists for Faxton in years before and after that date . 30 householders were listed in 1662 , but 34 were recorded for the year ending 25 March 1674 . Former residents have recalled that Faxton could only be reached by horse-drawn vehicles , as none of the roads leading to it were made up to accommodate motor vehicles ; they considered that to be a major factor in the decline of the village . The parish church of St Denis suffered extensive vandalism during the early 20th century . It ceased to be used for public worship in 1939 and was demolished in 1958 . There is now just one house standing on this remote hilltop location , overlooking the rolling farmland . The Northamptonshire Record Office holds the christening , marriage and burial registers for the parish . # Sir Augustine Nichols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Augustine Nichols , a judge of the Court of Common Pleas under James I of England . He was a Knight of the Bath , born in Faxton in 1559 ; he died in 1616 . In 1610 , the Manor of Kibworth , Leicestershire was jointly granted to Augustine , Anthony Shugborough and John Smith after Ambrose Dudley , the Earl of Warwick , died without an heir . It is not clear what happened to the manor immediately after this , but by 1632 the manor was being held by the Berrige family . Judge Nichols had a clerk working for him . He was Thomas Dudley , a relation of the Nichols family . In 1627 Thomas Dudley , with his wife , daughter Anne , and her husband Simon Bradstreet , sailed for America .

Prior joining Oldham Athletic , Hudson was linked with Grimsby Town on loan following the trial , however , the move never happened . Following his debut against Chesterfield in the League Cup , Hudson signed a one-year deal with the club . He spent two months on loan at Oldham Athletic while Iain Dowie was manager there . As a result of having his first team opportunities , Hudson loan spell with Oldham Athletic would be extended for another month twice .

Despite scoring on his full home debut , Hudson never managed to establish himself in the first team in his first two seasons , with Dowie preferring Fitz Hall and Gonzalo Sorondo , followed by a partnership of Hall and Darren Ward . Dowie left in the summer of 2006 , and was replaced by Peter Taylor . Under Taylor , Hudson became a first team regular , making 42 appearances in 200607 , largely alongside Leon Cort . In 200708 , under Neil Warnock , he played largely alongside Jos Fonte , and missed only one game all season .

It is known that he studied under the esteemed artist Titian . # The Rape of Ganymede # The Rape of Ganymede is Mazza 's best-known painting , and depicts the legendary account of an eagle ( either the Aetos Dios or a manifestation of Zeus himself ) kidnapping the handsome Ganymede and taking him to Mount Olympus to serve as both Zeus ' lover and as cupbearer to the gods . Some legends speak of Zeus ' eagle kidnapping Ganymede : # Ganymede was a beautiful Trojan prince who caught the eye of Zeus .

0769514 Label = Sony BMG ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' ( ) is the second studio album by Puerto Rican urban/hip hop band Calle 13 , released on April 24 , 2007 , by Sony BMG . Recorded in various countries while on tour in promotion of the duo 's debut album ' ' Calle 13 ' ' , ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' marked an evolution in the band 's musical and lyrical style . While writing the album , the duo took a trip to South America to explore areas populated by Latin America 's indigenous and African-descended minorities , a journey that greatly influenced the music on ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' . The album features six guest artists and delves into genres such as tango , bossa nova , cumbia , and electronica . ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' debuted at number one on the US ' ' Billboard ' ' Top Latin Albums chart , selling 12,000 copies in its first week . The record was also certified Gold in Argentina by the Argentine Chamber of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single released from the album , Tango del Pecado , reached number 14 on the ' ' Billboard ' ' Latin Rhythm Airplay chart . The record received positive reviews from critics , who praised the album 's experimental nature and unique lyrical themes . The album also won Best Urban Music Album and Best Urban Song for Pal ' Norte at the 8th Annual Latin Grammy Awards . A film entitled ' ' Sin Mapa ' ' documenting the group 's travel experiences while recording the album was released on July 29 , 2009. # Background # Calle 13 was formed when step-brothers Residente ( real name Ren Prez Joglar ) and Visitante ( real name Eduardo Jos Cabra Martnez ) began creating music together in 2004 . The step-brothers hosted their music on a website , and began searching for a record label in order to release their music commercially . After sending demo tapes to White Lion Records , the duo was offered a record deal . The duo gained recognition for their controversial song Querido FBI , which responded to the killing of Filiberto Ojeda Ros , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon after Querido FBI gained notoriety for Calle 13 , the band 's 2005 eponymously titled debut album was released and became commercially and critically successful in Latin America . The group was subsequently labeled as reggaeton , a genre that the duo wished to distance itself from . Visitante commented on the situation : The truth is that the first record had only four reggaetons . Those were the cuts used for promotional purposes , and so thats the brand that was put on us . But from the beginning , to me , reggaeton never offered anything musically . My brother liked it , yes , but we always tried to execute it in an organic way , with real instruments and mixing it with other genres. # Recording # While writing ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' , the duo took a trip to South America to explore areas populated by Latin America 's indigenous and African-descended minorities . Residente reflected on the journey , stating , We saw horrible things , but also things that were incredibly beautiful . Some of the contrasts are really intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visitante discovered and purchased several new musical instruments on the trip including a quijada , a charango and a bombo legero , all of which were used on the song Llegale a Mi Guarida . Residente and Visitante felt that writing on the road was conducive to the group 's creative output . The group 's journeys were documented in a film entitled ' ' Sin Mapa ' ' , which debuted on July 29 , 2009 at the New York International Latino Film Festival and later was released on DVD . ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' was recorded in various countries , as the band was on tour during the making of the album . Residente explained that the group did not feel any pressure to compete with the success of ' ' Calle 13 ' ' , and felt that the recording of ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' was a smoother process than the first : The main difference for us this time around was that we had more opportunities , more tools and more money . We were also on tour at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing during the travels , while my brother would write the music . Residente was invited by La Mala Rodriguez to come to Spain to collaborate on a song . He agreed , as he greatly admired La Mala 's work , and the two met for drinks where they discussed the kind of song they wanted to create before going to the studio to record what would later become Mala Suerta Con el 13 . # Composition # # Music # On the record , the band wished to experiment more with live instruments and diverse styles of music . Margarita Diaz of ' ' NY Daily News ' ' referred to ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' as an exhilarating travelogue through the sounds and rhythms of South America . Visitante , who composed the music on the album , credits the musical diversity to his past . He began playing classical piano at age six , and at age 17 , he joined a varied array of bands and played saxophone and keyboards . ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' features more guest artists than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tego Caldern , La Mala Rodrguez and Orishas . The introduction to the album , as described by Elijah Wald of the ' ' Los Angeles Times ' ' , sounds like a lovely Baroque chorale - unless one speaks Spanish , in which case it becomes immediately evident that it 's an ornate canon of the filthiest words in Puerto Rican street slang . Tango del Pecado mixes tango and reggaeton , and has been referred to as tango-tn . The song features Argentinian music producer Gustavo Santaolalla and his Bajofondo Tango Club . Puerto Rican rapper Tego Caldern is featured on Sin Exagerar , which contains guitar influenced by surf rock . Additionally , the song Cumbia de los Aburridos is strongly influenced by Colombian cumbia music , featuring an accordion and a horn section . Un Beso De Desayuno mixes electronica , rap and bossa nova . # Lyrics # Residente described the album as more introspective and autobiographical than its predecessor . With the lyrics on the record , Residente aimed for authenticity , attempting to tackle subjects not typically discussed in conventional reggaeton . He explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is similar to watching a movie , in the sense that the album depicts real life events and uses profanity to evoke emotion in the listener . Leila Cobo of ' ' Billboard ' ' wrote that the lyrical content of ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' ranges from sophomoric humor to outright perversion . The song Mala Suerte Con el 13 , the group 's collaboration with La Mala Rodriguez , is a satire of the Latin macho attitude . He wished to defy and poke fun at traditional gender roles , citing feminist philosopher Judith Butler as an influence ; I wanted to record a duet between a guy who 's weak and inadequate , and a woman who 's a sexual psychopath and has all the power in the world . A complete mockery of macho stereotypes . In the same vein , Sin Exagerar parodies the misogyny that Residente felt had saturated the reggaeton scene . The album 's lead single , Tango del Pecado , is addressed to the parents of Residente 's then-girlfriend , former Miss Universe Denise Quiones , who did not approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song expresses how he will still date her regardless of their opinions , and author Ed Morales observes that It 's a calling out of the morality of Latin America . It 's just an invitation to turn everything upside-down by embracing the ugly and profane in life and , you know , asking people to go on that journey . Tango del Pecado also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of Sbele el volumen a la msica satnica ( turn up the satanic music ) . Residente asserts that he did not add the line to create a reaction , saying , I never do something expecting something . I do things because I like them . El Avin Se Cae depicts the thoughts of a drunken airplane passenger . In Pal Norte , Residente discusses the plight of immigrants in the United States . Commenting on the track 's lyrical themes , he explained I had wanted to do that theme because I think it is an important topic . And not just for the immigrants in the United States but all over . It is a song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puerto Ricans . All the people leave one country for another for the same reasons . Although much of the album addresses immigration and moving to different countries , La Crema is a celebration of living in Puerto Rico . # Title and artwork # The album 's name was inspired by an experience from Residente and Visitante 's childhood . When they were children , Visitante would visit his brother at the Calle 13 ( 13th Street ) of the El Conquistador subsection of Trujillo Alto , Puerto Rico every week . Since the subsection is a gated community , visitors were routinely asked Residente o visitante ? ( Resident or visitor ? ) by a security guard when approaching the community 's main gate . Therefore , Visitante would identify himself as a visitor , while Residente would have to insist that he was a resident to clear the gate . The pair named themselves Calle 13 after the street their family 's house was on . The title is also meant to refer to the status of immigrants in the United States , a recurring theme on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canteen on her chest resembling the Sacred Heart of Jesus . Residente noted that the image represents Hispanic immigrants coming to the United States , in an attempt to both sanctify the immigrants and humanize the holy images common in Latin America . An image inside the CD booklet features Residente with stigmata in his hands . He noted that the photo is intended to portray Jesus as a regular guy who deals with struggles similar to those of people crossing borders . He further commented , Obviously , the art of the CD is not made for people who are used to seeing the guy with the chick in a bikini in a car with all her jewelry . We do n't come here to befuddle the people more . # Release and reception # # Chart performance # ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' debuted on the U.S. ' ' Billboard charts Tango del Pecado , the first single released from the album , reached number 14 on the ' ' Billboard ' ' Latin Rhythm Airplay chart . The second single , Cumbia de los Aburridos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Hot Latin Songs chart . Pa'l Norte , the third single from the record , reached number 27 on the ' ' Billboard ' ' Hot Latin Songs chart and number 40 on the Regional Mexican Songs chart . The fourth and final single was Un Beso de Desayuno , which failed to chart . # Critical reception # The album received positive reviews from critics . Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic gave ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' 4 out of 5 stars , noting the disc 's diverse musical styles and unique lyricism : Residente is a gifted rapper who matches Eminem in terms of wit and playfulness while Visitante is a similarly gifted producer who creates multi-layered tracks that rarely sound alike . Andrew Casillas of Stylus Magazine gave the album an A- grade , calling it a trailblazing record . Casillas praised Residente 's rapping on the record , calling his performance a revelation and referring to the song Un Beso de Desayuno as the band 's most noble achievement : a fully formed reggaetn love song . However , Casillas felt that the album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donald Duck on a treadmill . Olivia Muoz of ' ' The Philadelphia Inquirer ' ' referred to the record as weird , seductive , thought-provoking and hilarious all at once , and despite noting the unconventional lyrical themes , she deemed many of the songs to be surprisingly danceable . Phil Freeman of ' ' The Village Voice ' ' called the album more thoughtful and musically broad-minded than its predecessor , and noted that the album gave Residente a platform for a more explicit political consciousness than some might have predicted , referring to the songs Pal Norte and La Cumbia de los Aburridos . Agustin Gurza of the ' ' Los Angeles Times ' ' opined that the album is more mature , though no less outrageous than the band 's debut , and referred to Tango del Pecado and Pal ' Norte as two of the most memorable songs of the year . Nuria Net of ' ' Vibe ' ' felt that the cutting edge appeal of the debut album was reduced to vulgar lyrics on ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' , writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reggaeton to cumbia to tango , Calle 13 's powerful social critiques are but a memory . # Awards # At the 8th Annual Latin Grammy Awards on November 8 , 2007 ' ' Residente o Visitante ' ' received two Latin Grammy Awards : Best Urban Music Album and Best Urban Song for Pal ' Norte . It was also nominated for Album of the Year , and Best Short Form Music Video for the video of the first single Tango del Pecado . Calle 13 performed at the ceremony in a well-received act featuring Orishas and the Stomp dance troupe . The performance was referred to by Agustin Gurza of the ' ' Los Angeles Times ' ' as both a celebratory and seditious moment . In late-2009 , the Latin music website Club Fonograma named it the 5th best album of the decade . # Track listing # # Bonus tracks # # Chart positions # # Weekly charts # # Year-end charts # # Album certification #

The lyrics were written in 1855 by Jacob Sijbrands Bakker in the West Frisian dialect spoken on the island . Schylge is the name of Terschelling in local Frisian , and Oan Schylge means To Terschelling . The origin of the music is uncertain : Perhaps it has been composed by Hendrik Rotgans ( 18511910 ) , but it could also have been borrowed from an older folk song . At most occasions , only the first and the last verse are sung . # Lyrics # O , Schylge myn lntse , wat hab ik dy jeaf dy fynt my toch deaf : Dan slt ik myn earen , of geet it te bont mar straf se terstont : O Schylge , myn lntse , s droeg en s heag de Noardsee y n't eag : H trots bin dyn dunen , h wyt is dyn sn myn jeaf Schylgerln : O Schylge , myn lntse , do leist my oant hort dy dogt dy te kort : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myn jeaf Schylgerln : # Translation # O , Terschelling my little land , how much do I love you will just find me deaf : Then I close my ears , but if it goes to far and punish them immediately : O , Terschelling my little land so high and so dry facing the North Sea : How proud are your dunes , how white is your sand my beloved Terschellingerland : O Terschelling , my little land , you are embraced in my heart is not worthy of you : For as long as you remain standing , so steadfast on your sand my beloved Terschellingerland : 
0863514 birthplace = Rennes , Brittany , <br/> Kingdom of France Pierre Jean Robiquet ( 13 January 1780 April 1840 ) was a French chemist . He laid founding work in identifying amino acids , the fundamental bricks of proteins . He did this through recognizing the first of them , asparagin , in 1806 , in the industry 's adoption of industrial dyes , with the identification of alizarin in 1826 , and in the emergence of modern medications , through the identification of codeine in 1832 , a powerful molecule today of widespread use with analgesic and antidiarrheal properties . Robiquet was born in Rennes . He was at first a pharmacist in the French armies during the French Revolution years and became a professor at the cole de pharmacie in Paris , where he died . ( For biography details refer to the French Wikipedia article ) Notable scientific achievements were among other things his isolation and characterization of properties of asparagine ( the first amino acid to be identified , from asparagus , achieved . In 1806 , with Louis Nicolas Vauquelin ) , cantharidin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , caffeine ( 1821 ) , alizarin ( later on moved to mass industrial production by Carl Grbe and Carl Theodore Liebermann in Germany , and by William Henry Perkin in Great Britain ) and purpurin ( 1826 ) , Orcin ( 1829 ) , amygdalin ( 1830 ) , as well as codeine ( 1832 ) . Some of these discoveries were made in collaboration with other scientists . # Academic titles and distinctions # Registered Pharmacist ( 1808 ) , lecturer in chemistry at the cole Polytechnique ( 1811 ) , Deputy Professor in History of pharmaceutical matters ( 1811 ) then Professor ( 1814 ) then Administrator-Treasurer ( 1824 ) at the Ecole de Pharmacie now the Facult de Pharmacie see 3 , member then Secretary General ( 1817 ) and President ( 1826 ) of the Socit de Pharmacie later on known as Acadmie Nationale de Pharmacie see 8 , member of the Acadmie de Mdecine ( 1820 ) , member of the Acadmie des Sciences ( 1833 ) , one of the founders and first President of the Socit de Prvoyance des Pharmaciens see 6(1820) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1830 ) . # Discovery of asparagin , the first aminoacid ever identified # In the fall of 1805 , Robiquet , then a young help working in the laboratory of Louis Nicolas Vauquelin , started analyses , with what rudimentary methods were then available , with asparagus juice . After a number of operations he obtained a cristallized white matter , which he and Vauquelin tried to characterize in 1806 as day by day their attempts found it to be some kind of new chemical principle with hitherto unknown properties , nothing like well known mineral salts classically obtained in the 18th century . Duly convinced this is something completely new , they call this matter asparagin , after the asparagus plant they extracted it from . Asparagin will turn out to be one of the 22 amino acids that build-up all living matter on earth , the first ever identified and understood as belonging to a new class of molecules . Progress in isolating the other amino acids will be very slow , with less than a handful in total during the whole 19th century . # Discovery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19th century , all dyes used for colouring cloth were natural substances , many of which were expensive and labour-intensive to extract . Furthermore , many lacked stability through washing or exposure to sunlight , or fastness . For instance , the colour purple , which had been a mark of aristocracy and prestige since ancient times in Rome , the Middle East and Egypt , was especially expensive and difficult to producethe dye used , known as Tyrian purple , was made from the glandular mucus of certain molluscs . Its extraction was variable and complicated , and dependent on the availability of the very specific type of shell ( actually two types , now known the one as Bolinus brandaris , and the other as Hexaplex trunculus , nowadays classified within two different genders ) from which it was extracted . Another type of natural red dye used from times immemorial was obtained from madder root in Central Asia and Egypt , where it was grown as early as 1500 BC . Cloth dyed with madder root pigment was found in the tomb of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Ages , Charlemagne encouraged madder cultivation . It grew well in the sandy soils of the Netherlands and became an important part of the local economy . By 1804 , the English dye maker George Field had introduced new techniques known as ' ' lake ' ' madder , that extended the use of the tincture to paints . Robiquet obtained from madder root two distinct molecules with dye properties , the one producing a magnificent red , that he called alizarin , which proved as well extremely stable , and another , of less stable properties , that he called purpurin . Some 30 years later in April 1856 , William Henry Perkin , then a mere youngster working as assistant at the Royal College of Chemistry in London within a team intent on research over the synthesis of quinine , a potent drug , discovered a process that obtained a purple dye ( which he called mauveine ) from aniline , which in turn could be easily obtained from coal tar ; over the next ten years Perkin set up the first industrial model of molecules obtained through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research from numerous teams all over Europe on coal tar by-products , while he himself pursued such a work on top of his industrial activity . Thus it came that in 1868 , in turn alizarin was proved to be obtainable from anthracene , in parallel by Perkin and by Carl Grbe and Carl Theodore Liebermann , both working in Germany for the BASF company ; unfortunately Perkin missed the patent priority by one single day , alizarin 's extraordinary properties made it become the first really mass industry-produced dye and enabled the rise of BASF to first rank in the chemistry industry world . # Discovery and industrialization of codeine , a safe morphine-derivable molecule with widespread applications # Codeine is probably Robiquet 's most important contribution , that prevails still today with a very strong presence and impact on everyman 's daily life ; in effect , until the beginning of the 19th century , raw opium was used in diverse preparations known as laudanum ( see Thomas de Quincey 's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater ) , paregoric elixirs ( a number of them , very popular in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and health or even death hazards to users from improper preparation or improper use were frequent . The isolation of codeine by Robiquet from opium 's several active components while working on refined morphine extraction processes , opened the path to the elaboration of a new generation of specific antitussive and antidiarrheal potions of much safer use , based on codeine only , which became immediately extremely popular . Codeine is nowadays by far the most widely used opiate in the world and very likely even the most commonly used drug overall according to numerous reports over the years by organizations such as the World Health Organization and its League of Nations predecessor agency and others . It is one of the most effective orally-administered opioid analgesics and has a wide safety margin . It is from 8 to 12 percent of the strength of morphine in most people ; differences in metabolism can change this figure as can other medications , depending on its route of administration . While codeine can still be directly extracted from opium , its original source , most codeine is nowadays synthesized from morphine through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing by a hair 's breadth the identification of the benzoyl radical in 1830 # Robiquet has analysed the chemical byproducts that could be obtained from a variety of plants : asparagus , madder root , as already mentioned , with the important associated discoveries , and also others , which mostly helped in consolidating the existence of some molecules in a wide range of plants . Thus , in 1809 , Robiquet extracts from liquorice root a sweetish matter which he dubs glycyrrhizine , from Glycirrhiza , the denomination of the genus to which belongs liquorice . He also obtained an oily fraction ( 0.8% ) , small quantities of a matter with properties of a gum , albuminic substances , tannins , starch , a yellowish dye , a fraction with bitter taste , and , as from asparagi , a fraction that can be crystallized and seemingly close to asparagin , which it will be indeed proven to be in 1828 by Plisson . Robiquet likewise analysed a variety of animal tissues . Thus in 1810 , he isolated from ' ' Lytta vesicatoria ' ' , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he proves is the cause of the severe irritations and blisters provoked by that insect , and is present in a variety of unrelated species that use the molecule as a protection of their eggs from predation 1 ( Two families of insects belonging to the order of Coleoptera synthetise that molecule : Meloidae and Oedemeridae . The first family , to the which Lytta vesicatoria belongs in the Lytta genus , is rich of several thousands of species ) In fact , even back into the days of the early classical period civilizations of the western Mediterrean , some types of flies from Spain had a reputation for inducing aphrodisiac effects when used in preparations after having been desiccated . Cantharidin has never been proven to provide such collateral benefits , whereas Robiquet demonstrated it had very definite toxic and poisonous properties comparable in degree to that of the most violent poisons known in the 19th century , such as strychnine . This particular study , that demonstrated , as early as in 1810 , the possibility to separate , using energetic methods , a simple principle that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft methods has been exemplary for the burgeoning community of chemists in the early 19th century , and will prompt very rapidly a flurry of similar attempts that will yield within a few decades an incredible number of molecules from an ever growing number of research groups throughout Europe , and soon in the trail , in the US . In the frame of that same investigation , Robiquet in addition evidences the presence of uric acid within insects feeding on plant tissues . Over a period of some fifteen years , Pierre Robiquet will also conduct a series of investigations on bitter almonds oil , a complex substance obtained from Prunus dulcis . In 1816 , together with Jean-Jacques Colin , they obtain a new component which they call ther hydrochlorique , in effect 1,2-Dichloroethane , which they will try to promote as a reinvigorating medicine ( a common pursuit in those days , as is shown by the early uses of mixture such as Coca-Cola ) . In 1830 , together with Antoine Boutron-Charlard , Robiquet obtains a new molecule which he calls amygdalin ; this component presented strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidenced . This discovery was opening the door to the huge family of aromatic molecules , that are based on the cyclic 6 carbon benzenoic structure . In their various attempts at breaking down amygdalin in by-products , Robiquet and Boutron-Charlard obtained benzaldehyde but they failed in working out a proper interpretation of the structure of amygdalin that would account for it , and thus missed the identification of the benzoyl radical C <sub> 7 </sub> H <sub> 5 </sub> O. This last step was achieved some few months later ( 1832 ) by Friedrich Whler and Justus Liebig , these two got somehow a bit unfairly all the credit for this breakthrough result that was opening an entirely new branch for the industry of chemicals with wide-ranging applications . Amygdalin and related variant molecules have been used throughout the 19th ( under promotion e.g. by Ernst T. Krebs ) and 20th centuries as anti-cancer drugs , however with inconclusive results as to actual benefits , while it was demonstrated in 1972 in a study at the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute that amygdalin and a related product that was commercialized under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some patients , due to degradation in corpore that produced cyanide. # Main published works # * 1805 : ' ' Essai analytique des asperges ' ' Annales de chimie , 55 ( 1805 ) , 152171 * 1806 : ' ' La dcouverte d'un nouveau principe vgtal dans le suc des asperges ' ' L.N.Vauquelin et P.J.Robiquet , Annales de Chimie , 57 , p8893. * 1810 : ' ' Expriences sur les cantharides ' ' , Robiquet , Annales de Chimie , 1810 , vol. 76 , pp. 302322. * 1812 : ' ' Observations sur la nature du kerms ' ' , Robiquet , Annales de Chimie , 81 ( 1812 ) , 317331. * 1816 : ' ' Recherches sur la nature de la matire huileuse des chimistes hollandais ' ' , Robiquet , Colin , Annales de Chimie et de Physique , 1816 , vol. 1 , pp. 33745. * 1817 : ' ' Observations sur le memoire de M.

0894514 Paul Friedmann was a German philanthropist ; born at Berlin in the middle of the nineteenth century . Friedmann was of Jewish descent , and is connected with the family of Moses Mendelssohn . Much distressed over the fate of the Russian Jews after the persecutions of 1882-1890 , in 1890 he visited the land of Midian and resolved to found a colony there . He had a steam-yacht ( ' ' Israel ' ' ) built in Scotland , and went to Krakow personally to select the first immigrants . Twenty-four of these , under the leadership of Friedmann , Baron von Seebach , and Lieutenant Thiele , with a doctor , a chemist , and a builder , left Cairo in the middle of November , 1891 . A landing was made at Sharm al-Moza on the east side of the Gulf of Aqaba ; but the new colony did not last for more than two months . Internal dissensions broke out between the leaders , who were all Christians , and the Jews . The Egyptian government also feared complications with the Turkish soldiers encamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned . Friedmann , who had sunk 170,000 marks in the project , brought suit against the Egyptian government for 25,000 . The Russian consul in Cairo also opened an investigation , and violent denunciatory articles appeared in the Egyptian press , especially in connection with the death of one of the settlers who had been forced to leave the encampment because of insubordination . In connection with the venture , Friedmann privately published ' ' Das Land Madian ' ' ( Berlin , 1891 ) . # Bibliography # * ' ' Israelit ' ' , pp. 177 , 262 , 365 , 407 , 906 , 1146 .

To the east was Christchurch , to the west was Poole and to the north east was the river Stour . There were villages at Kinson , Throop , Holdenhurst and Iford and a handful of buildings at Pokesdown but the area between these communities was just a wilderness of pine trees , gorse , ferns and heather . The area now called central Bournemouth and the Pier Approach was ' Bourne Mouth ' the mouth of the Bourne Stream . No-one lived at Bourne Mouth and the only regular visitors were a few fishermen , turf cutters and gangs of smugglers who landed their cargoes of spirits , tea and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heath was called the Liberty of West Stour ( later , the Liberty of Westover ) . It was divided into six tythings : ' Muscliff ' , ' Muccleshell ' , ' Throop ' , ' Holdenhurst ' , ' Iford ' and ' Tuckton &amp; Wick ' . These areas were common land used by the inhabitants for livestock and by the poor for wood and turves . The western and southern parts of the heath had once been a hunting estate ' Stourfield Chase ' but by the late 18th century only a small part of this was maintained : the ' Decoy Pond Estate ' ( now known as ' Coy Pond ' and being wholly in the neighbouring historic town of ' ' Poole ' ' ) comprising several fields around the Bourne Stream and including a cottage known as Decoy Pond House , which stood near where The Square is today . # Christchurch Inclosure Act 1802 # Until 1802 the area was common land . The Christchurch Inclosures Act 1802 and the Inclosure Commissioners ' Award of 1805 transferred hundreds of acres into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act , three Commissioners were appointed to divide up the land and allot it according to an individual 's entitlement . They were also empowered to set out the roads and to sell plots of land to pay for their work in creating the award . The Commissioners were Richard Richardson of Lincolns Inn Fields , John Wickens of Mapperton , Dorset and William Calpcott of Holdenhurst . Their clerk was William Baldwin of Ringwood . Whilst the landed gentry were well represented with the Commissioners , the ordinary commoners who used and depended on the common land were concerned that they would lose all rights and would have nowhere for their animals and nowhere from which to collect wood and turves . However , they managed to persuade William West , the farmer at Muscliff Farm , to create a petition on their behalf and to present it to the Commissioners at a meeting in Ringwood . The result was that five areas of land , totalling 425 acre , were set aside for the benefit of the occupiers of certain cottages in lieu of their Rights or pretended Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today known as ' Meyrick Park ' , ' Queens Park ' , ' Kings Park ' , ' Redhill Common ' and ' Seafield Gardens ' and are held in trust by the Five Parks Charity . More than half the land sold was bought by two men , William Dean of Littledown House , who paid 639 for 500 acre including the West Cliff and what is now King 's Park . Sir George Ivison Tapps , the Lord of the Manor of Christchurch , paid 1,050 for 205 acre including the East Cliff and part of central Bournemouth . Sir George decided to plant thousands of pine trees on his land . It was the valuable medicinal properties of these trees , combined with the invigorating sea air , that the town owes its origin . In 1809 a new building appeared on the heath . Originally called the Tapps Arms after Sir George Tapps , and later the Tregonwell Arms . It stood where Post Office Road meets Old Christchurch Road . The pub was a favourite haunt of smugglers and later became Bournemouth 's first post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army officer Lewis Tregonwell visited in 1810 , he found only a bridge crossing a small stream at the head of an unspoilt valley ( or ' chine ' ) that led out into Poole Bay . An inn had recently been built near what is now The Square ( the centre of Bournemouth ) , catering both for travellers and for the smugglers who lurked in the area at night . Captain Tregonwell and his wife were so impressed by the area that they bought several acres and built a home , which is today part of the Royal Exeter Hotel . Tregonwell also planted pine trees , providing a sheltered walk to the beach . The town was to grow up around its scattered pines . Twenty-five years after the Tregonwells started work on their holiday mansion , Bournemouth was still only a small community with a scattering of houses and cottages . # Growth and development as a resort # In 1835 after the death of Sir George Ivison Tapps , his son Sir George William Tapps-Gervis inherited his father 's estate and started developing the seaside village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up along the south coast such as Weymouth and Brighton . Sir George employed Christchurch architect Benjamin Ferrey to plan the Gervis Estate . The Westover Villas were commenced in 1837 . Ferrey included hotels in his design for Bournemouth . The first two hotels opened in 1838 . One was the Bath Hotel , which went on to become the Royal Bath , although the original building was much smaller and less grand than the current facility . The other was the Belle Vue Boarding House , which stood where the Pavilion is now and later became the Belle Vue and Pier Hotel . Bournemouth also acquired its first church in 1838 , before this people had to travel to Poole , Holdenhurst or Christchurch for Sunday worship . The first church was converted from a pair of semi-detached cottages which stood in The Square roughly where Debenhams is today . A pointed turret was added to the roof and fitted with a bell . During the week the building was used as a schoolroom . By 1841 there were still only a few hundred people living in Bournemouth but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaside village had an important visitor , a physician called Augustus Bozzi Granville , the author of a book called ' ' The Spas of England ' ' which described health resorts around the country . As a result of his visit , Dr Granville included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book . It was this more than anything that put the town on the map as the perfect place for people with health problems , especially chest complaints which were far more common in the 19th century than today . Bournemouth quickly became a destination for affluent holiday-makers and for invalids in search of the sea air . In the 1840s the fields south of the road crossing ( later The Square ) were drained and laid out with shrubberies and walks . In 1849 a bridge was built over the Bourne Stream , providing the beginning of The Square . In 1856 , Parliament approved the Bournemouth Improvement Act . Under the Act , a board of 13 Commissioners was established to organise all the things involved in the running of a small but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , street lighting and street cleaning . Under the guidance of their surveyor , Christopher Crabb Creeke , the Bournemouth Commissioners quickly launched a programme of work designed to improve the amenities of their town and make it more attractive to visitors . The Commissioners continued to govern the town until 1890 and were the forerunners of the Bournemouth Borough Council of today . By the 1860s the fields to the north were also laid out with walks by the owners of the Branksome Estate . In the early 1870s all the fields were leased to the Bournemouth Commissioners , by the freeholders . These fields now form The Pleasure Gardens , which run through the centre of the town ; although the name The Lower Pleasure Gardens is no longer officially applied to the area south of The Square . The area continued to progress with the development of the railways and the popular idea of visiting the seaside for holidays . Among the people who contributed to the development of Bournemouth at this time were Sir Percy Shelley ( son of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Railway # On 14 March 1870 the London and South Western Railway Company opened the first railway station in the town , following an extension of the Ringwood-Christchurch branch line . The station was built on the east side of Holdenhurst Road . The facilities offered by this station were very basic . On 18 June 1874 a second station opened in Queens Road , near Westbourne , at the end of an extension from Broadstone Junction . It was served initially only by the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway with trains connecting with the LSWR at Wimborne . On 20 July 1885 the present mainline station , designed by William Jacob , was opened on the west side of Holdenhurst Road . A link between the two stations , then known as Bournemouth West and Bournemouth East , was opened on 28 September 1886 . Also in 1886 a ' ' Boscombe ' ' station was opened , the name was later changed to ' ' Pokesdown ( Boscombe ) ' ' . In 1897 when a new Boscombe station ( since closed ) was opened on land situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renamed Pokesdown . The new Bournemouth East station was renamed Bournemouth Central on 1 May 1899 . The building of railway links made Bournemouth much easier to get to and more people began to visit the town . # Tram # Between July 1902 and April 1936 , Bournemouth Corporation operated a tramway between Bournemouth , Poole , Christchurch and Winton . On 1 May 1908 , a tram was derailed on Avenue Road ( near to the present day library ) , killing 7 people and seriously injuring 2 . The tramway system began its closure in 1929 when motorbuses of Hants and Dorset Motor Services were introduced as a tram replacement on the Lower Parkstone route . Bournemouth tram number 85 is preserved and on static display at the Museum of Electricity in Christchurch . # The Pleasure Gardens and the sanatorium # A large sanatorium , overlooking the Central Gardens , treated patients with chest diseases . It has recently been re-developed as Brompton Court , a complex of retirement homes , preserving its remarkable chapel . Next to the sanatorium was built the magnificent Mont Dore Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel 's heyday in the 1880s it was renowned nationally and internationally for its sumptuous luxury which included possessing one of the first telephones in England the number was 3 . The hotel was then used during the First World War as a hospital to treat wounded soldiers . Although the number of invalids sent to the town dropped in the late 19th century , the resort was still booming and its population increasing rapidly . As Bournemouth 's popularity increased , the town centre spawned theatres , concert halls , cafs , cinemas and more hotels . # History of Bournemouth Pier # The first pier in Bournemouth consisted of a short wooden jetty that was completed in 1856 . This was replaced by a much longer wooden pier , designed by George Rennie , which opened on 17 September 1861 . Due to an attack by Teredo worm , the wooden piles were removed in favour of cast iron replacements in 1866 , but even with this additional benefit just over a year later the pier was made unusable when the T-shaped landing stage was swept away in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a further ten years until November 1876 when another severe storm caused further collapse rendering the pier too short for steamboat traffic . The Rennie pier was subsequently demolished , and replaced in 1877 by a temporary structure . During the next three years a new pier , designed by Eugenius Birch , was completed . At a cost of 2,600 the new Bournemouth Pier was opened by the Lord Mayor of London on 11 August 1880 . Consisting of an open promenade , it stretched to a length of 838 ft ( 255.4 m ) and spanned some 35 ft ( 10.6 m ) across the neck of the pier , extending to 110 ft ( 33.3 m ) at the head . With the addition of a bandstand in 1885 , military band concerts took place three times a day in summer and twice daily throughout the winter . Covered shelters were also provided at this time . Two extensions , in 1894 and 1909 respectively , took the pier 's overall length to more than 1000 ft ( 304.8 m ) . In common with virtually all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bournemouth Pier was substantially demolished by soldiers from the 18th Field Park Company of the Royal Engineers on 5 July 1940 as a precaution against German invasion . The pier was repaired and re-opened in August 1946 . Refurbishment of the pier head was carried out in 1950 , and ten years later a rebuild of the substructure was completed in concrete to take the weight of a new pier theatre . A structural survey of 1976 found major areas of corrosion , and in 1979 a 1.7m restoration program was initiated . Having demolished the old shoreward end buildings , replacing them with a new two-storey octagonal leisure complex , and reconstructed the pier neck in concrete giving it the bridge-like appearance that it retains today , the work was completed in two years . # The Winter Gardens # The town 's first large entertainment venue was the original glass Winter Gardens , built in 1875 as the home of the town 's municipal orchestra , ( now the internationally renowned Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra ) . Elgar , Sibelius and Holst conducted there , but the acoustics were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was demolished . Its replacement , opened two years later , was intended as an indoor bowls centre , but by chance turned out to have superb acoustics , and after the Second World War it became the orchestra 's new home . Before the opening of the BIC , the Winter Gardens welcomed just about every major entertainer of the day , including Maurice Chevalier , The Beatles , Pink Floyd , Queen and Morecambe and Wise . The building had been in decline since the late 1970s , and stood closed as the town council examined alternative uses . Then , despite a local vote and promises that it would be kept open , the hall was demolished in May 2006. # The Pavilion and the Westover Road cinemas # The Pavilion dates from 1925 and was built on the site of the former Belle Vue boarding house , one of the town 's first buildings . Theatrical legends , including Ralph Richardson and Trevor Howard , played the Pavilion Theatre in its heyday . The Pavilion faces the cinemas and upmarket shops of Westover Road , which prides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road 's Odeon cinema began life as the Regent in 1929 and retains many of the art deco features of the era . It was known as the Gaumont from 194986 and used to host live performances as well as films . Stars who appeared there included Ella Fitzgerald , Dusty Springfield , Victor Borge and , in 1963 , the Beatles . The cinema now has six screens . The nearby ABC cinema dates from 1937 , when it contained one 2,600-seater auditorium . It has three auditoriums today , one of them boasting the areas largest cinema screen , and is capable of projecting epics in 70mm . Recent research has suggested that local residents , especially those of a younger demographic are keen to see a new live entertainment venue , easily accessible to the surrounding areas . # Recent history # The section of the coast both to the east and to the west of Bournemouth was very important during the Second World War . For example Poole ( Poole Harbour ) was the departure point for many ships participating in the D-Day landings , and Studland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of practice live fire beach landings in preparation for the Normandy Landings . Bournemouth itself was not a main target of bombing during the war but was on the route for other raids ( e.g. on Coventry ) and German bombers were known to unload their spare bombs on the town ; 219 local people were killed by bombing during the war . After the Second World War , Bournemouth saw a period of decline as a seaside resort and a tourist destination , similar to other resorts across England . However the population of the town and its surrounding suburbs continued to grow at a considerable rate . In 1880 , the town had a population of 17,000 people . By 1900 this had risen to 60,000 , and by 1990 it had more than doubled again , reaching 150,000 . In the latest census , the town had a population of 163,441 . Since the 1990s there have been increasing calls for the town , together with Poole , to attain official city status ( as per the example of Brighton &amp; Hove ) due to its sheer expanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries saw Bournemouth being moved from Hampshire to Dorset in 1974 . In 1997 , Bournemouth became a unitary authority . On 15 September 1980 Bournemouth was one of the first areas outside a major city to get its own independent radio station . 2CR FM broadcasts from near Bournemouth railway station ; its name , meaning ' ' 2 Counties ' Radio ' ' , is derived from the fact that its broadcast area includes parts of the counties of Dorset and Hampshire . The town itself has continued to expand its business and tourist destination potential . The Bournemouth Eye , for example , is located in the Lower Gardens a few yards from the Square . It is a tethered helium-filled balloon in which the public can travel up to a height of five hundred feet , depending on the weather on any given day ( in high winds it sometimes does not operate ) . There are good views to be obtained of the surrounding area , from the Isle of Wight round including the Purbeck Hills and Cranborne Chase . In the 1990s a leisure complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Bournemouth Pier . The building itself proved deeply unpopular amongst locals for its lack of aesthetic quality and for blocking the sea view . It featured on and came second in Demolition , a 2005 Channel 4 programme asking the public to choose the building that they most wanted to demolish . Questions were asked of the Council about the cost of demolition as a result . The building is currently being demolished to create an outdoor public space . Bournemouth was the first local council in the UK to install Closed-circuit television Recently , a new 9.5 million Bournemouth Library was completed in 2003 , winning the ' ' Prime Minister 's Better Public Building Award ' ' in the British Construction Industry Awards competition in recognition of its relatively low cost and high fit with client requirements . In recent years the town has attracted a high number of jobs in financial services , with JP Morgan Chase , Liverpool Victoria , Abbey Life and Portman Building Society all opening major offices . JP Morgan Chase has a large campus style office on the outskirts of the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town centre , and employs over 4,000 people in the town . The financial sector is in fact the biggest source of income for Bournemouth , although a general misbelief is that the tourism sector is responsible for this .

0986514 birthplace= Jonquire , Quebec Pierre Reid ( born August 16 , 1948 ) is a politician and educator in the Canadian province of Quebec . He has served in the National Assembly of Quebec since 2003 , representing Orford as a member of the Quebec Liberal Party . Reid is a former cabinet minister in Jean Charest 's government . He is not to be confused with a senior public servant in Quebec named Pierre Reid . # Early life and academic career # Reid was born in Jonquire , Quebec . He holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Universit Laval ( 1970 ) and a Ph.D . in mathematics from Universit de Paris XI ( 1974 ) . After working as a computer consultant for IBM Canada , Reid became a professor of administrative data processing at the Universit du Qubec Chicoutimi in 1976 . Two years later , he joined the business administration department at the Universit de Sherbrooke . He became a vice-rector of the university in 1989 , and four years later he defeated Marie Malavoy to become university rector . Reid supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which provided a $105,000 scholarship for research in the natural gas sector . He speculated about privatizing some academic programs in 1996 , to find new revenue sources in light of government cutbacks . In 2001 , he welcomed a $4.7 million investment from the government of Canada to fund health researchers on campus . Reid was appointed as an associate deputy minister at Industry Canada in 2001. # Legislator # # Education minister # Reid was a star candidate for the Liberal Party in the 2003 provincial election and was easily elected as the Member of the National Assembly of Quebec for Orford . The Liberal Party won a majority government in this election under Jean Charest 's leadership , and Charest appointed Reid as his education minister on April 29 , 2003 . A ' ' Montreal Gazette ' ' report from this period indicated that Reid was well regarded for his skills as a manager and administrator . ; University funding Reid made significant changes to university student funding in 2004 , shifting $103 million from bursaries to repayable loans . He also announced that student loans would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to income after graduation ; in some cases , graduates would not be required to make payments during periods of unemployment . Student leaders and the opposition Parti Qubcois strongly criticized the shift from bursaries to loans , describing it as a betrayal of the province 's lower-income students . The Canadian Federation of Students also criticized Reid 's repayment policy , with one student leader sarcastically describing it as Study now , pay forever . Reid argued in response that his changes would allow more students to register at universities . There were several protests against Reid 's funding reforms in 2004 and 2005 , including one protest in February 2005 that turned violent . Reid promised to re-invest massive funding into loans and bursaries after a revolt of the Liberal Party 's youth wing in late 2004 , but did not remain in the education portfolio long enough to carry this out . Reid promised in November 2004 that he would maintain Quebec 's long-standing university tuition freeze during the Charest government 's first mandate , but would not make any commitments beyond that time . ; Jewish private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association between Quebec 's public schools and Jewish private schools in a bid to improve cultural ties . This decision was made after the firebombing of one of Montreal 's United Talmud Torah schools which resulted in the destruction of a library . The following month , Quebec media sources discovered that the Charest government had agreed to pay full funding to Jewish private schools through the cultural association . This was a shift from a previous policy of funding about sixty per cent of the costs . The funding decision was made without cabinet approval or discussion ; when it became public knowledge , Reid indicated that other private religious and cultural schools would also be eligible for such funding . Several public school officials , teachers groups , and parents groups criticized the decision on the grounds that it would undermine public education . The Charest government was ultimately forced to cancel its plans following an extremely negative public reaction . While still supporting the funding change in principle , Charest acknowledged that his government had handled the matter poorly . One ' ' Montreal Gazette ' ' columnist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcing its funding policy change from the beginning . The controversy damaged Reid 's public standing . ; High schools In May 2003 , Reid announced that francophone schools would start English lessons in the first grade and devote more class time to English-language education . The previous Parti Qubcois government had brought English lessons forward from the fourth to the third grade , but had reduced the overall time devoted to English . Reid announced in 2004 that persons with serious criminal records would not receive provincial teaching certificates . He dropped plans to introduce a professional teaching order after teachers voted in large numbers against the plan . ; Federal initiatives In addition to serving as provincial education minister , Reid was also appointed to a two-year term as chair of the Council of Ministers of Education , Canada in October 2003 . Reid was critical of the Canadian Council on Learning introduced by Jean Chrtien 's federal government , saying that its money would be better spent on provincial initiatives . # Government services minister and backbencher # Widely regarded as having mishandled the university funding and Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister after a cabinet shuffle on February 18 , 2005 . An editorial in the ' ' Montreal Gazette ' ' later described this as a make-work position for Reid . This position offered him a much lower public profile , and he was dropped from cabinet entirely on February 27 , 2006 . During his time as government services minister , Reid announced that the Charest government would replace an information management system approved by the previous ministry . Reid supported the Charest government 's plan to sell part of the Mont-Orford National Park to private interests in 2006 , despite the concerns of environmental groups and some Liberal backbenchers . Critics noted that Reid was the friend of a key developer who stood to benefit from the sale , although Reid responded that his friend was only one of many potential buyers . Reid was narrowly re-elected in the 2007 provincial election , which reduced the Liberals to a minority government . He was returned to a third term in the 2008 election , as the Liberals regained majority status .

1012514 Offham is a village in the local government district of Tonbridge and Malling in Kent , England , five miles to the west of Maidstone . Offham has a Quintain on the village green that was reported in medieval times for use in jousting . It is reputed to be the last English quintain in its original position , though it was removed for safe keeping during the Second World War . The village gets its name from Offa , the name of a Saxon landowner , and ham , a village or homestead . # History # The village has been occupied since Roman times , and the major Roman road from London to the Weald ran through the parish . Offham grew in prominence in the early ninth century under the Saxons . Jack Straw , the rebel during the reign of Richard II , is said to have been born at Pepingstraw Manor in the parish . # Quintain # The village is famed for its medieval quintain which stands on the green , believed to be the last remaining example in the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in height with a freely-rotating arm on the top . One end of the arm is flat ( the eye ) , with the other used to attach heavy objects such as a leather pack . In a sport dating back to perhaps Roman times , a horseman would ride at the quintain at full pace with his lance extended to strike the flat end . Should the horseman not be riding sufficiently quickly , the arm would swing round and the heavy object knock him off his horse . # Ragstone # The village 's houses are predominantly constructed from ragstone , Kent 's most celebrated building stone . The stone has been mined in the parish since Roman times , with its hardness and durability making it a popular choice for fortifications in London and the south east . # Church # The first church in the parish was founded by the Saxon lord of the manor who built a private chapel in the early ninth century . After the Norman Conquest it was replaced by a stone church and the lower stage of the tower of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated to St Michael . # Village life # The village hosts annual May Fay celebrations on the green ; a May Queen parades through the village , school children perform maypole dances , and occasionally local horseriders undertake the ancient sport of Tilting at The Quintain , though a replica quintain is now used . The King 's Arms is the only remaining public house . Built in the sixteenth century , the pub was originally two cottages , later owned by a saddler and harness maker who ran his business there until granted a license in 1680 . Offham also has its own primary school 
1034514 Julia Thornton is a professional harpist , who to date has released two albums : Harpistry ( 2003 ) and Eye of the Storm ( 2004 ) . # Musical life and career # Julia Thornton began to play the harp aged 11 . Having wanted to do so since the age of three , her parents initially managed to stave off her persistence , allowing her piano lessons at the age of 9 . Eighteen months later , having taken well to the piano , she was allowed to have her first harp lesson . Beginning on an Irish instrument called the clarsach ( an instrument that is n't as big as a concert harp and does n't have the pedal mechanism ) , she was taught by a local teacher initially who had to return to her native Czechoslovakia after a year . After this she was taught by Daphne Boden ( who eventually became Thornton 's professor at the Royal Academy of Music ) . Within the year , Boden asked Thornton 's parents if they would buy her a concert harp - a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a Japanese instrument called Ahomaya . Thornton extended her studies by attending the Junior Department of the Royal College of Music on Saturdays , where she began also to learn percussion . At this time she also became a member of the National Youth Orchestra . Having won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music , she studied there for 5 years ( 1990 1995 ) , winning many prizes for her harp-playing ( including the Julia Leney and Renata Schefelstein harp awards , and both the harp prizes at the Royal Overseas League competition ) . She was also awarded the Mathias Prize for the best performance of his Sante Fe Suite at the International Harp Competition in Cardiff . After finishing at the R.A.M. , Thornton 's work consisted of a mixture of teaching , orchestral and solo work . She performed with a wide variety of orchestras , opera and ballet companies , and gave recitals including performances at the Cambridge , Beaumaris and Cheltenham music festivals . She also joined the panel of Yehudi Menuhin 's Live Music Now ! , which enables young musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in schools , day-care centres , homes for the elderly , homes for those suffering from Alzheimers or dementia , prisons and young offenders ' institutes . Julia 's main breakthrough came at a yoga demo in 1999 , where she was playing the harp , and was thus spotted by one of the attendees - Clare Davies , wife to Bryan Ferry 's producer , Rhett Davies . Following an audition , she began working with Bryan Ferry , performing on the harp and percussion instruments on his As Time Goes By tour , which comprised a collection of 1930s standards such as the title track . In 2001 she was asked to join the Roxy Music reunion tour - a tour that would involve 50 days of percussion-playing only , and despite her love for the harp , Thornton took this opportunity . The tour involved visits to Australia and Japan , and playing in some of the world 's biggest stadia such as Wembley . The seeds of Harpistry were sown during her involvement with a mediaeval instrumental group , Arcana Mundi , a concept dreamt up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sure enough , she signed a deal with EMI in 2002 , and between trips abroad with Bryan Ferry , she sourced the material for her first album , with help from Leon . She recorded her first album , Harpistry , in the Netherlands in 2003 , before going to Brazil on another Bryan Ferry tour . On Sept 1 2005 , www.PlaybillArts.com reported that Harpistry charted no. 13 on the Billboard Classical chart . She released her second album , Eye of the Storm , on her own label , Crossways Records , due to frustrations with EMI . In the spring of 2007 , Julia became a member of a new band , The Metaphors , started with Roxy Music founding members Andy MacKay and Paul Thompson , on reeds and drums . Filling out the band are Hazel Mills on Keyboards and T J Allen on guitar and effects . That summer they went into the studio to record their first album . The 6 song collection called ' ' London ! Paris ! New York ! Rome ! ' ' was released to iTunes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their website a month later . To date The Metaphors have played a limited number of live dates . In June &amp; July 2009 , Julia returned to her percussion and harp duties for the 30th anniversary tour of Jeff Waynes Musical Version of The War of the World for a 21 concert tour of England and Europe . According to her webpage , Julia has plans to go into the studio and record her own music and record with members of Lunar Dunes , a band that she has sat in with . Julia is also following up on her interest in yoga by taking classes towards becoming a yoga instructor . # Personal life # Julia grew up in Ipswich . Commenting on her wide range of musical tastes from Mahler to Joni Mitchell , she said My parents were hippies !

1100514 Any Love is the seventeenth single by Japanese recording artist Misia . It was released on July 4 , 2007 as the first single from Misia 's eighth studio album ' ' Eighth World ' ' . # Background # Any Love is Misia 's first release since switching record labels , from Avex back to BMG Japan . The single was released simultaneously with The Tour of Misia 2007 Ascension concert DVD and Blu-ray . The first press edition of the single comes with a bonus DVD , which includes the music video for Any Love and a special film documenting Misia 's stay in Nairobi , Kenya , where the video and artwork for the single cover were shot . # Composition # The A-side , Any Love , was written by Misia , while the composition and production were handled by Sinkiroh . The song was inspired by Misia 's visit to the Kibera slum in Nairobi , Kenya . Coming from ' ' Ascension ' ' , which dealt with the broad themes of life and its origins , Misia wanted to write about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or everyday life . After writing lyrics that seemed too perfect and lacking a sense of reality , Misia felt at a loss and decided to take a trip to Africa , a place she had long wanted to visit . The culture and people left a deep impression on Misia which lead her to rewrite Any Love . In an interview with music site Vibe , she commented , ( the song ) was done before I left for Africa , but when I came back I realized there was more that I wanted to say , so I rewrote the lyrics and recorded it over again . In today 's society , it 's hard to discern between reality and truth and I wanted this song to reflect what I think makes them different . When asked about the importance of the line Honki de aishiteku , which is repeated throughout the choruses , Misia elaborated : # When I came back to Tokyo , I was taken aback by the contrast between the world I had been living in and the world I had just visited . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got back to my friends and family and music , I realized that love is what makes it all real . It 's what 's needed to distinguish reality from truth . The message of the song is that when facing love , you have to take it seriously . # The B-side , Soba ni Ite ... , was also written by Misia and composed and produced by Sinkiroh . When asked about the song 's message , Misia explained : # ( Soba ni Ite .. ) speaks of a message I 've wanted to express for a few years now . I think it 's great that , with the Internet , cell phones , and e-mail , there are now a variety of ways for us to communicate with each other , but they 've somewhat become substitutes for direct interactions . The reason people feel the need to be close to each other is because , as humans , we connect with more than just our eyes or our ears , but with our entire body . We can never be entirely sastified without meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercials for Kose cosmetics Sekkisei , starring Nanako Matsushima. # Chart performance # Any Love debuted on the Oricon Daily Singles chart at number 8 on July 3 , 2007 and climbed to number 7 the following day . It peaked at number 8 on the Oricon Weekly Singles chart , with 13,811 copies sold in its first week . Any Love is Misia 's first top ten single in three years , since Namae no Nai Sora o Miagete . It charted for five weeks and sold a total of 22,876 copies . # Track listing # # Charts # class= wikitable sortable plainrowheaders ! scope= col Chart ( 2007 ) ! scope= col Peak **6;823338;br position ! scope= row Oricon Daily Singles ! scope= row Oricon Weekly Singles ! scope= row SoundScan Japan Weekly Singles <small> ( Limited Edition ) </small> ! scope= row align= left Taiwan Five Music J-pop/K-pop Chart # Release history # class= wikitable plainrowheaders ! scope= col Region ! scope= col Date ! scope= col Format ! scope= col Label ! scope= row Japan ! scope= row Taiwan ! scope= row Hong Kong # References @ 
1123514 1:35 scale is the most popular scale for model military vehicles , with an extensive lineup of models and aftermarket parts available from a wide variety of manufacturers . The roots of 1:35 as a military modelling scale lie in early motorized plastic tank kits . To accommodate electric motors and gearboxes , these models needed to be made in a larger scale . There were many companies making such tanks , but it was Tamiya 's example that made 1:35 a ' ' de facto ' ' standard . Company chairman Shunsaku Tamiya explains the origins of the scale in his book ' ' Master Modeler ' ' : # After the success of the Panther , I thought it would be a good idea for us to produce other tanks from different countries in the same scale . I measured the Panther and it turned out to be about 1/35 of the size of the original . This size had been chosen simply because it would accommodate a couple of B-type batteries . Tamiya 's 1/35 series tanks eventually got to be known around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather awkward scale . # Early kits in the scale , built around bulky motorization components , often sacrificed scale appearance and detail , but their large size and potential for intricate superdetailing appealed to hobbyists . Over the years , kits have become more and more detailed and accurate , and nowadays there is a whole industry in 1:35 dedicated to offering aftermarket detail parts for kits . After a new kit is released , companies like Aber and Eduard usually make detail sets available for it , allowing modellers to replace kit parts with more accurate photoetched alternatives . In terms of model range , 1:35 is typically limited to military land vehicles and figures . Some helicopter kits also exist in the scale , whereas large airplane kits are more commonly done in 1:32 scale . In recent years , there have been some aeroplane releases in 1:35 as well , typically of vehicles operating in close contact with ground forces , such as the Fieseler Storch liaison aircraft or the Horsa glider . The figures are usually designed to go with the AFV 's though , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figures are unusual and pre-1914 figures are very rare indeed .

1163514 osgridref = founder = Polish immigrants cult = construction cost = St. Wenceslaus ( ) is a church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago located in Chicago , Illinois , northern USA . One of the many Polish churches visible from the Kennedy Expressway , it is , along with St. Hyacinth Basilica , one of two monumental religious edifices that dominates the Avondale skyline . It is well known for its unique architecture , as well as being the site where photographer and historic preservationist Richard Nickel was married . Although the historic church is a stop for many of the tourists visiting the landmark Villa District , this majestic Romanesque-Art Deco hybrid is actually a few blocks south of the district 's formal boundaries . St Wenceslaus is accessible via the Blue Line 's Addison street station . # History # St. Wenceslaus was founded in 1912 as a Polish parish to relieve overcrowding at St. Hyacinth parish , which first met in a small wooden frame structure at Roscoe Street and Lawndale Avenue . The present church was built in 1942 and was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel Stritch in the Archdiocese of Chicago . One of Chicago 's ' ' Polish Patches ' ' , the Polish term for the surrounding neighborhood , Wacawowo derives from the Polish name for the church 's patron , Saint Wenceslaus I , Duke of Bohemia . In recent years , the ethnic character of St. Wenceslaus parish has undergone a gradual change from an exclusively Polish parish to one that is multicultural and multiracial , as the neighborhood first witnessed an influx of Hispanic and Filipino immigrants during the 1990s and later began to experience minor pockets of gentrification . Today Mass is celebrated in three languages : English , Polish and Spanish . St. Wenceslaus has been administered by the Congregation of the Resurrection since July 2000 . On June 10 , 1950 Richard Nickel , an American photographer and historian best known for his efforts to preserve and document the buildings of architect Louis Sullivan married Adrienne Dembo , a young Polish-American girl at St. Wenceslaus . St. Ladislaus in Portage Park was originally a mission of St. Wenceslaus in what was then a primarily rural area annexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the firm of McCarthy , Smith and Eppig , a firm that worked extensively with Cardinal George Mundelein and produced numerous Chicago area Catholic churches during the Great Depression era , including Queen of Angels in Chicago , St. Joseph and St. Francis Xavier churches in Wilmette , and St. Bernardine in Forest Park . It is considered to be one of the best examples of the fusion of Art Deco stylings with medieval European architecture in the city of Chicago . The building 's overall design is a fusion of Byzantine and Romanesque elements with a host of Art Deco features that were current at the time of construction . The church is encased in walls of pressed brick trimmed with Indiana Limestone , some of it adorned with carved ornament to highlight the building 's sacred function . At the point where the nave narrows to the apse , a campanile arises , designed to direct the attention of the viewer to the purpose of the edifice . Two monumental angel sculptures loom over the faade of the main entrance , which leads into a spacious and commodious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dame and Oriental marble on a base of Red Levanto , while the floor is paved in ceramic tiles . Beyond the narthex is the spacious and well-lit nave which can accommodate a congregation of up to twelve hundred worshipers . To a height of ten feet above the floor and against the entire exterior wall a wainscot of rich American Black walnut has been installed , a wood known for its exceptional beauty and sturdiness . The wainscot rests on top of a continuous base of Windham Verde Antique marble , and is indented by four confessionals and in the forward part of the nave four votive shrines that are set up against the wall . The aisles are paved in ceramic tiles while the pews are carved out of the same American Black walnut . The apse or sanctuary is enclosed behind a heavy rail of rich Breccia Orientale penetrated at regular intervals with a lattice of brilliant bronze . A floor of oriental and Florida Deep Rose marbles leads to the predella or platform of the church 's dominant feature , the main altar . The church is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its crucifix , set against a huge background or reredos of inlaid wood . The reredos was formed by inlaying some twenty-five precious woods on a foundation of Honduras mahogany rising to a height of thirty-seven feet above the sanctuary floor is the setting for the huge crucifix , which is cut from a mammoth block of bluish-black Port D'Oro marble . The main altar from which this featured crucifix arises is a permanent altar in the liturgical sense that it rests on its own foundation , as is required by Roman Catholic liturgical law . The side , or votive altars are similarly constructed . The altar table rests on a predella or stylobate of Verde Nicoli stone , the top platform which is inlaid with red Verona and rose coral marbles . The sacrificial table or mensa is light colored pietra di Trani surmounted by a tabernacle of rose coral marbles . The votive or side altars conform and hence are in harmony with the principal altar , both in color and in form The church 's interior features a distinct historicizing Art Deco motif with a color scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive stained glass windows . Although the church is filled with depictions of Polish Saints and folkloric motifs , it is much more subdued in comparison with Chicago 's more well-known Polish Cathedrals . The church 's most well-known asset , a set of mosaic stations of the cross that were executed in the Vatican City in Rome , line the sides of the building 's interior . All the furnishings of the church such as altars , pulpit , pews and the like were executed from designs by the original architects at the expressed wish of Monsignor Czastka who was the pastor at St. Wenceslaus at that time in order to present a consistent and harmonious edifice . The Purgatorial shrine was painted by Jan Henryk De Rosen who famously decorated the interior of the Armenian Cathedral in L'viv .

1289514 The Lesser Antillean Macaw or Guadeloupe Macaw ( ' ' Ara guadeloupensis ' ' ) is a hypothetical extinct species of macaw which may have been endemic to the Lesser Antillean island of Guadeloupe . In spite of the absence of conserved specimens , many details about the Lesser Antillean Macaw are known from several contemporary accounts , and the bird is thought to be the subject of some illustrations . It is therefore one of the best-documented species of hypothetical extinct bird . Based on these accounts , Austin Hobart Clark named the species in 1905 . A parrot ulna from the island of Marie-Galante was assigned to the species in 2001 , but this identification has since been disputed . According to contemporary descriptions , the body was red and the wings were red , blue and yellow . The tail feathers were long . Apart from the smaller size and the all-red colouration of the tail feathers , it resembled the Scarlet Macaw of tropical South America and may therefore have been a close relative of that species , or possibly captive Scarlet Macaws which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including those of the poisonous Manchineel tree , was monogamous , nested in trees and laid two eggs twice a year . Early writers described it as being abundant on Guadeloupe , but it was becoming rare by 1760 and only survived in uninhabited areas . Disease and hunting by humans are thought to have eradicated it shortly after . The Lesser Antillean Macaw is one of thirteen extinct macaw species hat have been proposed to have lived in the Caribbean islands . Many of these species are now considered dubious because only two are known from physical remains , and there are no extant endemic macaws on the islands today . Macaws were frequently transported between the Caribbean islands and the South American mainland in both prehistoric and historic times , so it is impossible to know whether contemporaneous reports refer to imported or native species . # Taxonomy # The Lesser Antillean Macaw is well-documented , in spite of the lack of any existing specimens , since it was mentioned and described by several contemporaneous writers . Red parrots thought to be the Lesser Antillean Macaw were first mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1553 , referring to a 1496 account by Ferdinand Columbus , who mentioned parrots as big as chickens , which the Caribs called Guacamayas , on Guadeloupe . In 1774 , Comte de Buffon also stated that Christopher Columbus had found macaws on Guadeloupe . Jean-Baptiste Du Tertre gave the first detailed descriptions in 1654 and 1676 , and illustrated the bird and other animals found on Guadeloupe . Jean Baptiste Labat also described the bird in 1742 . Austin Hobart Clark gave the Lesser Antillean Macaw its scientific name , ' ' Ara guadeloupensis ' ' , in 1905 , based on the contemporaneous accounts , but he also cited a 1765 colour plate as possibly depicting this species . He wrote that it was different in several features from the superficially similar Scarlet Macaw ( ' ' Ara macao ' ' ) , as well as the Green-winged Macaw ( ' ' Ara chloropterus ' ' ) and the Cuban Macaw ( ' ' Ara tricolor ' ' ) . The ornithologist James Greenway wrote that the macaws reported from Guadeloupe could have been imported to the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove . According to the palaeontologist Julian Hume , its similarity to the Scarlet Macaw indicates that they are close relatives , and that the Guadeloupe species may have descended from the mainland macaw . Greenway believed the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the Lesser Antillean macaw and other hypothetical extinct species suggested for Jamaica and Hispaniola . A small parrot ulna found on the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie-Galante , an adjacent island , was assigned to the Lesser Antillean Macaw by the ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman in 2001 . The ornithologists Storrs Olson and Edgar Maz Lpez cast doubt upon this identification , and proposed that the bone belonged to the extant Imperial Amazon ( ' ' Amazona imperialis ' ' ) . Its size and robustness was similar to ulnae of that species , and though it was worn , they identified what appeared to be a notch , which is also present on ulnae of the genus ' ' Amazona ' ' , but not in the genus ' ' Ara ' ' . In the same paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympatric parrot , the Guadeloupe Amazon ( ' ' Amazona violacea ' ' ) , arguing it was also probably identical to the Imperial Amazon . Subfossil remains from the island of Montserrat have also been suggested to belong to the Lesser Antillean macaw. # Extinct Caribbean macaws # Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America both in historic times by Europeans and natives , and prehistoric times by Paleoamericans . Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans , were traded between islands , and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus when he reached the Bahamas in 1492 . It is therefore difficult to determine whether the numerous historical records of macaws on these islands mention distinct , endemic species , since they could have been escaped individuals or feral populations of foreign macaws of known species that had been transported there . As many as thirteen extinct macaws have at times been suggested to have lived on the islands until recently . Only two endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains ; the Cuban Macaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saint Croix Macaw ( ' ' Ara autochthones ' ' ) , is only known from subfossils . No endemic Caribbean macaws remain today ; they were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times . Many hypothetical extinct macaws were based only on contemporaneous accounts , but these species are considered dubious today . Several of them were named in the early 20th century by Walter Rothschild , who had a tendency to name species based on little tangible evidence . The Violet Macaw ( ' ' Anodorhynchus purpurascens ' ' ) was named for accounts of blue parrots also reported from Guadeloupe , the Red-headed Macaw ( ' ' Ara erythrocephala ' ' ) and the Jamaican Red Macaw ( ' ' Ara gossei ' ' ) were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica , the Martinique Macaw ( ' ' Ara martinica ' ' ) from Martinique island and the Dominican Green-and-yellow Macaw ( ' ' Ara atwoodi ' ' ) was supposedly from Dominica island . The tail feathers of the Scarlet Macaw are long and have blue tips , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tail feathers being shorter , it is not certain whether the Lesser Antillean Macaw was smaller than the Scarlet Macaw overall , as the relative proportions of body parts vary between macaw species . The tail feathers were longer than those of the Cuban Macaw , which were long . Du Tetre described the Lesser Antillean Macaw as follows in 1654 : Labat described the Lesser Antilles Macaw in much the same way in 1742 : Both authors wrote that the macaws were the largest parrots of Guadeloupe , and stressed that the parrot species of each Caribbean island was distinct and could be distinguished from each other visually and vocally . According to Hume , this means that the birds described could not simply have been escaped South American macaws . Furthermore , the docile and amiable nature described by Du Tetre and Labat does not match the behaviour of South American macaws. # Contemporary depictions # Apart from Du Tetre 's crude 1667 drawing and Labat 's 1722 derivative , a few contemporaneous paintings depict red macaws that may be the Lesser Antilles Macaw . A colour plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , entitled L'Ara Rouge ) shows a red macaw with entirely red tail feathers and more red on the tertial and scapular feathers of the wing than are present on the Scarlet Macaw. # Behaviour and ecology # Du Tetre gave a detailed account of the behaviour of the Lesser Antillean Macaw in 1654 : In a 1667 work , Du Tetre gave a similar account , and also said that the macaw only ate the poisonous Manchineel fruits in times of necessary . He also described its reproductive behaviour : The twice-yearly breeding may have actually been staggered breeding , which is practised by some tropical birds . Clark wrote that the Lesser Antillean Macaw also occurred on Dominica and Martinique , but there is no evidence for this . It may instead have existed on islands close to Guadeloupe . # Extinction # In 1534 , Johann Huttich wrote that the forests of Guadeloupe were full of this macaw , which was apparently as abundant as grasshoppers , and the natives of the island cooked it together with human flesh and that of other birds . In 1654 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat , and that some considered it unpalatable and even poisonous . He wrote that he and the other inhabitants of the island often consumed it , and that he experienced no ill effects from it . He also stated that the natives wore the feathers as head decoration and as moustaches through the septum of the nose . He described how it was hunted by the natives : Since Du Tetre wrote that the macaws were prone to sickness , an outbreak of a disease , along with hunting , may have contributed to its demise . In 1760 , Mathurin Jacques Brisson quoted a letter by M. de la Borde , which stated that macaws had become very rare in the Antillean islands because they were hunted for food . By then they could by only be found in areas not frequented by man , and were probably extinct soon after . Parrots are often among the first species to be exterminated from a given locality , especially islands .

1304514 Physical organic chemistry is the study of the relationship between structure and reactivity of organic molecules . More specifically , physical organic chemistry applies the experimental tools of physical chemistry to the study of the structure of organic molecules and provides a theoretical framework which interprets how structure influences both mechanisms and rates of organic reactions . It can be thought of as a subfield that bridges organic chemistry with physical chemistry . The term ' ' physical organic chemistry ' ' was itself coined by Louis Hammett in 1940 when he used the phrase as a title for his textbook . Physical organic chemists use both experimental and theoretical disciplines such as spectroscopy , spectrometry , crystallography , computational chemistry , and quantum theory to study both the rates of organic reactions and the relative chemical stability of the starting materials , transition states , and products . Chemists in this field work to understand the physical underpinnings of modern organic chemistry , and therefore physical organic chemistry has applications in specialized areas including polymer chemistry , supramolecular chemistry , electrochemistry , and photochemistry. # Chemical structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools of thermodynamics to study the bonding , stability , and energetics of chemical systems . This includes experiments to measure or determine the enthalpy ( H ) , entropy ( S ) , and Gibbs ' free energy ( G ) of a reaction , transformation , or isomerization . Chemists may use various chemical and mathematical analyses , such as a va n't Hoff plot , to calculate these values . Empirical constants such as bond dissociation energy , standard heat of formation ( H <sub> f </sub> ) , and heat of combustion ( H <sub> c </sub> ) are used to predict the stability of molecules and the change in enthalpy ( H ) through the course of the reactions . For complex molecules , a H <sub> f </sub> value may not be available but can be estimated using molecular fragments with known heats of formation . This type of analysis is often referred to as Benson group increment theory , after chemist Sidney Benson who spent a career developing the concept . The thermochemistry of reactive intermediates - carbocations , carbanions , and radicals is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data are available for radical systems . Carbocation and carbanion stabilities can be assessed using hydride ion affinities and pK <sub> a </sub> values , respectively . # Conformational analysis # One of the primary methods for evaluating chemical stability and energetics is conformational analysis . Physical organic chemists use conformational analysis to evaluate the various types of strain present in a molecule to predict reaction products . Strain can be found in both acyclic and cyclic molecules , manifesting itself in diverse systems as torsional strain , allylic strain , ring strain , and ' ' syn ' ' -pentane strain . A-values provide a quantitative basis for predicting the conformation of a substituted cyclohexane , an important class of cyclic organic compounds whose reactivity is strongly guided by conformational effects . The A-value is the difference in the Gibbs ' free energy between the axial and equatorial forms of substituted cyclohexane , and by adding together the A-values of various substituents it is possible to quantitatively predict the preferred conformation of a cyclohexane derivative . In addition to molecular stability , conformational analysis is used to predict reaction products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis is a bi-molecular elimination reaction ( E2 ) . This reaction proceeds most readily when the nucleophile attacks the species that is antiperiplanar to the leaving group . A molecular orbital analysis of this phenomenon suggest that this conformation provides the best overlap between the electrons in the R-H bonding orbital that is undergoing nucleophilic attack and the empty * antibonding orbital of the R-X bond that is being broken . By exploiting this effect , conformational analysis can be used to design molecules that possess enhanced reactivity . The physical processes which give rise to bond rotation barriers are complex , and these barriers have been extensively studied through experimental and theoretical methods . A number of recent articles have investigated the predominance of the steric , electrostatic , and hyperconjugative contributions to rotational barriers in ethane , butane , and more substituted molecules . # Non-covalent interactions # Chemists use the study of intramolecular and intermolecular non-covalent bonding/interactions in molecules to evaluate reactivity . Such interactions include , but are not limited to , hydrogen bonding , electrostatic interactions between charged molecules , dipole-dipole interactions , polar- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonding . In addition , the hydrophobic effectthe association of organic compounds in wateris an electrostatic , non-covalent interaction of interest to chemists . The precise physical origin of the hydrophobic effect originates from many complex interactions , but it is believed to be the most important component of biomolecular recognition in water . For example , Xu and Melcher ' ' et al . ' ' elucidated the structural basis for folic acid recognition by folate acid receptor proteins . The strong interaction between folic acid and folate receptor was attributed to both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions . The study of non-covalent interactions is also used to study binding and cooperativity in supramolecular assemblies and macrocyclic compounds such as crown ethers and cryptands , which can act as hosts to guest molecules . # Acid-base chemistry # The properties of acids and bases are relevant to physical organic chemistry . Organic chemists are primarily concerned with Brnsted-Lowry acids/bases as proton donors/acceptors and Lewis acids/bases as electron acceptors/donors in organic reactions . Chemists use a series of factors developed from physical chemistry -- **27;214552;TOOLONG , bond strengths , resonance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basicities . The hard-soft acid-base principle is utilized to predict molecular interactions and reaction direction . In general , interactions between molecules of the same type are preferred . That is , hard acids will associate with hard bases , and soft acids with soft bases . The concept of hard acids and bases is often exploited in the synthesis of inorganic coordination complexes . # Kinetics # Physical organic chemists use the mathematical foundation of chemical kinetics to study the rates of reactions and reaction mechanisms . Unlike thermodynamics , which is concerned with the relative stabilities of the products and reactants ( G ) and their equilibrium concentrations , the study of kinetics focuses on the free energy of activation ( G <sup> </sup> ) -- the difference in free energy between the reactant structure and the transition state structureof a reaction , and therefore allows a chemist to study the process of equilibration . Mathematically derived formalisms such as the Hammond Postulate , the Curtin-Hammett principle , and the theory of microscopic reversibility are often applied to organic chemistry . Chemists have also used the principle of thermodynamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws # The study of chemical kinetics is used to determine the rate law for a reaction . The rate law provides a quantitative relationship between the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentrations or pressures of the chemical species present . Rate laws must be determined by experimental measurement and generally can not be elucidated from the chemical equation . The experimentally determined rate law refers to the stoichiometry of the transition state structure relative to the ground state structure . Determination of the rate law was historically accomplished by monitoring the concentration of a reactant during a reaction through gravimetric analysis , but today it is almost exclusively done through fast and unambiguous spectroscopic techniques . In most cases , the determination of rate equations is simplified by adding a large excess ( flooding ) all but one of the reactants . # Catalysis # The study of catalysis and catalytic reactions is very important to the field of physical organic chemistry . A catalyst participates in the chemical reaction but is not consumed in the process . A catalyst lowers the activation energy barrier ( G <sup> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either stabilizing the transition state structure or destabilizing a key reaction intermediate , and as only a small amount of catalyst is required it can provide economic access to otherwise expensive or difficult to synthesize organic molecules . Catalysts may also influence a reaction rate by changing the mechanism of the reaction . # Kinetic isotope effect # Although a rate law provides the stoichiometry of the transition state structure , it does not provide any information about breaking or forming bonds . The substitution of an isotope near a reactive position often leads to a change in the rate of a reaction . Isotopic substitution changes the potential energy of reaction intermediates and transition states because heavier isotopes form stronger bonds with other atoms . Atomic mass affects the zero-point vibrational state of the associated molecules , shorter and stronger bonds in molecules with heavier isotopes and longer , weaker bonds in molecules with light isotopes . Because vibrational motions will often change during a course of a reaction , due to the making and breaking of bonds , the frequencies will be affected , and the substitution of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . # Substituent effects # The study of how substituents affect the reactivity of a molecule or the rate of reactions is of significant interest to chemists . Substituents can exert an effect through both steric and electronic interactions , the latter of which include resonance and inductive effects . The polarizability of molecule can also be affected . Most substituent effects are analyzed through linear free energy relationships ( LFREs ) . The most common of these is the Hammett Plot Analysis . This analysis compares the effect of various substituents on the ionization of benzoic acid with their impact on diverse chemical systems . The parameters of the Hammett plots are sigma ( ) and rho ( ) . The value of indicates the acidity of substituted benzoic acid relative to the unsubstituted form . A positive value indicates the compound is more acidic , while a negative value indicates that the substituted version is less acidic . The value is a measure of the sensitivity of the reaction to the change in substituent , but only measures inductive effects . Therefore , two new scales were produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One is <sup> + </sup> , which concerns substituents that stabilize positive charges via resonance , and the other is <sup> - </sup> which is for groups that stabilize negative charges via resonance . Hammett analysis can be used to help elucidate the possible mechanisms of a reaction . For example , if it is predicted that the transition state structure has a build-up of negative charge relative to the ground state structure , then electron-donating groups would be expected to increase the rate of the reaction . Other LFRE scales have been developed . Steric and polar effects are analyzed through Taft Parameters . Changing the solvent instead of the reactant can provide insight into changes in charge during the reaction . The Grunwald-Winstein Plot provides quantitative insight into these effects . # Solvent effects # Solvents can have a powerful effect on solubility , stability , and reaction rate . A change in solvent can also allow a chemist to influence the thermodynamic or kinetic control of the reaction . Reactions proceed at different rates in different solvents due to the change in charge distribution during a chemical transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition state structures . A prime example of the effect of solvent is the comparison of S <sub> N </sub> 1 and S <sub> N </sub> 2 reactions . Solvent can also have a significant effect on the thermodynamic equilibrium of a system . A common example of this is keto-enol tautomerization . In non-polar aprotic solvents , the enol form is strongly favored due to the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen-bond , while in polar aprotic solvents , such as methylene chloride , the enol form is less favored due to the interaction between the polar solvent and the polar diketone . In protic solvents , the equilibrium lies towards the keto form as the intramolecular hydrogen bond competes with hydrogen bonds originating from the solvent . A modern example of the study of solvent effects on chemical equilibrium can be seen in the study by Carlier et al . on the epimerization of chiral cyclopropylnitrile Grignard reagents . In this study it is shown that the equilibrium constant for the ' ' cis ' ' to ' ' trans ' ' isomerization of the Grignard reagent is much greaterthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form is enhancedin THF over diethyl ether . However , the faster rate of ' ' cis to trans isomerization ' ' in THF results in a loss of stereochemical purity . The understanding of the molecular configuration of reagents such as these is particularly important for improved selectivity in asymmetric synthesis . # Quantum chemistry # Many aspects of the structure-reactivity relationship in organic chemistry can be rationalized through resonance , electron pushing , induction , the eight electron rule , and s-p hybridization , but these are only helpful formalisms and do not represent physical reality . Due to these limitations , a true understanding of physical organic chemistry requires a more rigorous approach grounded in particle physics . Quantum chemistry provides a rigorous theoretical framework capable of predicting the properties of molecules through calculation of a molecules electronic structure , and it has become a readily available tool in physical organic chemists in the form of popular software packages . The power of quantum chemistry is built on the wave model of the atom , in which the nucleus is a very small , positively charged sphere surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their associated wavefunction , an equation which contains all information associated with that particle . All information about the system is contained in the wavefunction . This information is extracted from the wavefunction through the use of mathematical operators . The energy associated with a particular wavefunction , perhaps the most important information contained in a wavefunction , can be extracted by solving the Schrdinger equation ( above , is the wavefunction , E is the energy , and is the Hamiltonian operator ) in which an appropriate Hamiltonian operator is applied . In the various forms of the Schrdinger equation , the overall size of a particles probability distribution increases with decreasing particle mass . For this reason , nuclei are of negligible size in relation to much lighter electrons and are treated as point charges in practical applications of quantum chemistry . Due to complex interactions which arise from electron-electron repulsion , algebraic solutions of the Schrdinger equation are only possible for systems with one electron such as the hydrogen atom , H <sub> 2 </sub> <sup> + </sup> , H <sub> 3 </sub> <sup> 2+ </sup> , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar atomic ( s , p , d , f ) and bonding ( , ) orbitals . In systems with multiple electrons , an overall multielectron wavefunction describes all of their properties at once . Such wavefunctions are generated through the linear addition of single electron wavefunctions to generate an initial guess , which is repeatedly modified until its associated energy is minimized . Thousands of guesses are often required until a satisfactory solution is found , so such calculations are performed by powerful computers . Importantly , the solutions for atoms with multiple electrons give properties such as diameter and electronegativity which closely mirror experimental data and the patterns found in the periodic table . The solutions for molecules , such as methane , provide exact representations of their electronic structure which are unobtainable by experimental methods . Instead of four discrete -bonds from carbon to each hydrogen atom , theory predicts a set of four bonding molecular orbitals which are delocalized across the entire molecule . Similarly , the true electronic structure of 1,3-butadiene shows delocalized -bonding molecular orbitals stretching through the entire molecule rather than two isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A complete electronic structure offers great predictive power for organic transformations and dynamics , especially in cases concerning aromatic molecules , extended systems , bonds between metal ions and organic molecules , molecules containing nonstandard heteroatoms like selenium and boron , and the conformational dynamics of large molecules such as proteins wherein the many approximations in chemical formalisms make structure and reactivity prediction impossible . An example of how electronic structure determination is a useful tool for the physical organic chemist is the metal-catalyzed dearomatization of benzene . Chromium tricarbonyl is highly electrophilic due to the withdrawal of electron density from filled chromium d-orbitals into antibonding CO orbitals , and is able to covalently bond to the face of a benzene molecule through delocalized molecular orbitals . The CO ligands inductively draw electron density from benzene through the chromium atom , and dramatically activate benzene to nucleophilic attack . Nucleophiles are then able to react to make hexacyclodienes , which can be used in further transformations such as Diels Alder cycloadditons . Quantum chemistry can also provide insight into the mechanism of an organic transformation without the collection of any experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given molecular state , guessed molecular geometries can be optimized to give relaxed molecular structures very similar to those found through experimental methods . Reaction coordinates can then be simulated , and transition state structures solved . Solving a complete energy surface for a given reaction is therefore possible , and such calculations have been applied to many problems in organic chemistry where kinetic data is unavailable or difficult to acquire . # Spectroscopy , spectrometry , and crystallography # Physical organic chemistry often entails the identification of molecular structure , dynamics , and the concentration of reactants in the course of a reaction . The interaction of molecules with light can afford a wealth of data about such properties through nondestructive spectroscopic experiments , with light absorbed when the energy of a photon matches the difference in energy between two states in a molecule and emitted when an excited state in a molecule collapses to a lower energy state . Spectroscopic techniques are broadly classified by the type of excitation being probed , such as vibrational , rotational , electronic , nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) , and electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure determination is often aided by complementary data collected from X-Ray diffraction and mass spectrometric experiments . # NMR and EPR spectroscopy # One of the most powerful tools in physical organic chemistry is NMR spectroscopy . An external magnetic field applied to a paramagnetic nucleus generates two discrete states , with positive and negative spin values diverging in energy ; the difference in energy can then be probed by determining the frequency of light needed to excite a change in spin state for a given magnetic field . Nuclei that are not indistinguishable in a given molecule absorb at different frequencies , and the integrated peak area in an NMR spectrum is proportional to the number of nuclei responding to that frequency . It is possible to quantify the relative concentration of different organic molecules simply by integration peaks in the spectrum , and many kinetic experiments can be easily and quickly performed by following the progress of a reaction within one NMR sample . Proton NMR is often used by the synthetic organic chemist because protons associated with certain functional groups give characteristic absorption energies , but NMR spectroscopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fluorine , phosphorus , boron , and a host of other elements . In addition to simple absorption experiments , it is also possible to determine the rate of fast atom exchange reactions through suppression exchange measurements , interatomic distances through multidimensional nuclear overhauser effect experiments , and through-bond spin-spin coupling through homonuclear correlation spectroscopy . In addition to the spin excitation properties of nuclei , it is also possible to study the properties of organic radicals through the same fundamental technique . Unpaired electrons also have a net spin , and an external magnetic field allows for the extraction of similar information through electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) spectroscopy. # Vibrational spectroscopy # Vibrational spectroscopy , or infrared ( IR ) spectroscopy , allows for the identification of functional groups and , due to its low expense and robustness , is often used in teaching labs and the real-time monitoring of reaction progress in difficult to reach environments ( high pressure , high temperature , gas phase , phase boundaries ) . Molecular vibrations are quantized in an analogous manner to electronic wavefunctions , with integer increases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy between vibrational states is nearly constant , often falling in the energy range corresponding to infrared photons , because at normal temperatures molecular vibrations closely resemble harmonic oscillators . It allows for the crude identification of functional groups in organic molecules , but spectra are complicated by vibrational coupling between nearby functional groups in complex molecules . Therefore , its utility in structure determination is usually limited to simple molecules . Further complicating matters is that some vibrations do not induce a change in the molecular dipole moment and will not be observable with standard IR absorption spectroscopy . These can instead be probed through Raman spectroscopy , but this technique requires a more elaborate apparatus and is less commonly performed . However , as Raman spectroscopy relies on light scattering it can be performed on microscopic samples such as the surface of a heterogeneous catalyst , a phase boundary , or on a one microliter ( L ) subsample within a larger liquid volume . The applications of vibrational spectroscopy are often used by astronomers to study the composition of molecular gas clouds , extrasolar planetary atmospheres , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectroscopy , or ultraviolet-visible ( UV-vis ) spectroscopy , is performed in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and is useful for probing the difference in energy between the highest energy occupied ( HOMO ) and lowest energy unoccupied ( LUMO ) molecular orbitals . This information is useful to physical organic chemists in the design of organic photochemical systems and dyes , as absorption of different wavelengths of visible light give organic molecules color . A detailed understanding of an electronic structure is therefore helpful in explaining electronic excitations , and through careful control of molecular structure it is possible to tune the HOMO-LUMO gap to give desired colors and excited state properties . # #Mass spectrometry# # Mass spectrometry is a technique which allows for the measurement of molecular mass and offers complementary data to spectroscopic techniques for structural identification . In a typical experiment a gas phase sample of an organic material is ionized and the resulting ionic species are accelerated by an applied electric field into a magnetic field . The deflection imparted by the magnetic field , often combined with the time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then used to calculate the mass of the molecule . Often in the course of sample ionization large molecules break apart , and the resulting data show a parent mass and a number of smaller fragment masses ; such fragmentation can give rich insight into the sequence of proteins and nucleic acid polymers . In addition to the mass of a molecule and its fragments , the distribution of isotopic variant masses can also be determined and the qualitative presence of certain elements identified due to their characteristic natural isotope distribution . The ratio of fragment mass population to the parent ion population can be compared against a library of empirical fragmentation data and matched to a known molecular structure . Combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry is used to qualitatively identify molecules and quantitatively measure concentration with great precision and accuracy , and is widely used to test for small quantities of biomolecules and illicit narcotics in blood samples . For synthetic organic chemists it is a useful tool for the characterization of new compounds and reaction products . # #Crystallography# # Unlike spectroscopic methods , X-ray crystallography always allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths totally unavailable through spectroscopy . It is often used in physical organic chemistry to provide an absolute molecular configuration and is an important tool in improving the synthesis of a pure enantiomeric substance . It is also the only way to identify the position and bonding of elements that lack an NMR active nucleus such as oxygen . Indeed , before x-ray structural determination methods were made available in the early 20th century all organic structures were entirely conjectural : tetrahedral carbon , for example , was only confirmed by the crystal structure of diamond , and the delocalized structure of benzene was confirmed by the crystal structure of hexamethylbenzene . While crystallography provides organic chemists with highly satisfying data , it is not an everyday technique in organic chemistry because a perfect single crystal of a target compound must be grown . Only complex molecules , for which NMR data can not be unambiguously interpreted , require this technique . In the example below , the structure of the host-guest complex would have been quite difficult to solve without a single crystal structure : there are no protons on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two halves of the organic complex spectroscopy alone was unable to prove the hypothesized structure .

1336514 Old Market is a Conservation Area of national significance , to the east of the city centre in Bristol , England . Old Market Street and West Street form the central axis of the area , which is approximately bounded by New Street and Lawfords Gate to the north , Trinity Road and Trinity Street to the east , Unity Street and Waterloo Road to the south and Temple Way Underpass to the west . Old Market Street is an ancient market place which developed immediately outside the walls of Bristol Castle on what was for many centuries the main road to London ( now the A420 ) ; on market days Jacob Street and Redcross Street , which run parallel to Old Market Street , took the through traffic . Old Markets Pie Poudre Court , which dealt out summary justice to market-day offenders , was not formally abolished until 1971 .

Old Market suffered decades of neglect and severe decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic central shopping area from Castle Street to Broadmead and the construction of Temple Way Underpass and Easton Way , which severed it from Bristols pre-war shopping axis in both directions . Some important buildings still suffer from neglect , but the actions of local conservationists together with grant-aided schemes in the wake of its declaration as a Conservation Area in 1979 have done much to arrest the decline . Old Market has in recent years become a centre of Bristols gay scene , and has been proclaimed as Bristols Gay Village . # History # There is documentary evidence of a market immediately to the east of Bristol Castle from the mid-12th century . This area of fertile land with many market gardens was referred to as ' Old Market ' from the 15th century . In the 13th century , the area was enclosed by a defensive ditch , with Lawfords Gate at the eastern end separating it from West Street . The ditch marked the boundary of the town of Bristol . The area was characterised by long narrow plots of land , some of which survive today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local taxes , and became a place of inns , low lodgings , squatters and outlaws . Old Market Street prospered as Bristols trade grew , developing into a 370 m long street connecting the East Gate of the Castle with Lawfords Gate , wide in its middle section and narrowing for the gates . In the 15th and 16th century , the area grew in importance and became the site of almshouses and manufacture , as well as houses , inns and shops . Old Market did not fare well in the English Civil War . During the Parliamentarian attack on Lawfords Gate , much of West Street may have been destroyed , and buildings to the east of Lawfords Gate may have been demolished to give the Royalists a clear defensive line of fire . Following the Civil War much of the area was redeveloped . The Castle was demolished and with it the East Gate ; Old Market Street and Castle Street became a major commercial axis . Many of the buildings erected during this period survive today . In 1768 , Lawfords Gate was demolished , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into West Street . Old Market became home to a widening range of trades . In Old Market Street and West Street the well-off built town houses ; in the side streets leading off to either side the artisans crowded in . By the end of the 19th century , market trading was becoming increasingly difficult due to the increase in wheeled traffic . Old Market became an important tram terminus , serving areas to the east , north-west and south of the city . By now it was also a well-established shopping street , connecting seamlessly with Castle Street . Parts of the area were affected by slum clearance programmes in the 1930s , but it was the severance caused by the destruction of Castle Street together with the building of Temple Way Underpass ( which obliterated the western end of Old Market Street ) that sent the area into near-terminal decline . Some businesses relocated to Broadmead ; others closed . Large parts of the area were zoned for redevelopment , and the area was severely blighted . In the 1970s , the value of what remained started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Conservation Area . Since then many of its at-risk buildings have been restored , and a more sensitive approach to development has done much to improve the area . # Significant buildings # Old Market contains over 60 listed buildings , some dating from before the 17th century .

Other significant buildings include Kingsley Hall , a Georgian house jettied over the pavement , and 7 Redcross Street , a grand Georgian house with a shell porch .

It was held in the open air under an ancient oak tree , the site of which the Stag and Hounds Public House was built on . There is no actual record of when the court moved into the inn , where it was reputedly held in the first-floor room .

' The Road Goes On ' is loosely based on Bilbo 's walking song spoken by Bilbo and Frodo in ' ' The Hobbit ' ' and ' ' The Fellowship of the Ring ' ' respectively . ' The Cat and the Moon ' takes some of its lyrics from Frodo 's drinking song in ' ' The Fellowship of the Ring ' ' . ' The Song of Hope ' includes Elvish lyrics , which are a reworking of Galadriel 's lament ( in ' ' The Fellowship of the Ring ' ' ) , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lament for Moria ' takes lyrics from Gimli 's lament in ' ' The Fellowship of the Ring ' ' . The song ' Lothlrien ' is performed by Legolas as an introduction to Galadriel . At the same point in the novel Legolas sings about the Elf-maiden Nimrodel , and although the two songs share a similar sentiment their lyrics are unrelated . The song ' Now And For Always ' is taken from a conversation between Frodo and Sam in ' ' The Two Towers ' ' . The lyrics to ' Wonder ' , performed by Galadriel , are reminiscent of the Song of Eldamara lament sung and played on the harp by Galadriel in ' ' The Fellowship of the Ring ' ' . Many of the songs feature lyrics in Quenya , one of the fictional languages developed by Tolkien , despite the fact that the Elves during the Third Age communicated in Sindarin . The writers opted for Quenya because Tolkien had developed this language the most and it is a form of Elvish appropriate to the characters . # Original London Cast Recording # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2008 , and features 18 musical numbers from the show .

1372514 birthplace = Yang Yuanqing ( , born 1964 ) is the current chief executive officer of Lenovo. # Early life and education # Yang was born on 12 November 1964 to parents both educated as surgeons . He grew up poor as his parents were paid the same salaries as manual laborers . Yang spent his childhood in Hefei in Anhui province . Yang 's parents were repeatedly persecuted during the Cultural Revolution . Yang 's father , Yang Furong , was a disciplined man with strict standards . Yang said of his father , If he set a target , no matter what happened , he wanted to reach it . While his parents wanted him to pursue a career in medicine , and he had a budding interest in literature , Yang decided to study computer science on the advice of a family friend who was a university professor . Yang earned an undergraduate degree in computer science from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 1986 and graduated with a master 's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 1988. # Lenovo # Yang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beijing performing research for his master 's degree . Yang had initially planned on becoming a university professor but took a risk and accepted a position with Lenovo in sales . He was paid the equivalent of US$30 per month . In 1989 , Yang joined Legend , as Lenovo was then known , at the age of 25 . He was quickly promoted . Yang travelled to meet distributors throughout China and used his technical knowledge to help build an outstanding sales record . Yang also stood out at Lenovo for being a quiet , deep thinker . These qualities caught the attention of Liu Chuanzhi , who later promoted Yang to head Lenovo 's personal computer business at just 29 years old . Yang was elevated to CEO of the whole company when Liu retired in 2001 . Liu described Yang as A man who moves forward , takes risks and aims to innovate . Liu also said , I had been observing Yang a long time before I appointed him to take over the PC business . He had clear goals , was broad-minded and straightforward . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to write a bid to become an IBM reseller . After submitting his bid , Yang discovered that he had quoted twice the price of his competitors . Within a year of joining Lenovo in 1988 , Yang had lost interest in sales and had taken the TOEFL in preparation to study overseas . Yang stayed on after repeated requests from Liu Chuanzhi . Yang believed that he would benefit from exposure to American business practices but Liu persuaded him to delay his plans for two years . Problems at Legend due to lower import duties on personal computers did not allow for this though . Yang was responsible for Lenovo implementing specific job descriptions with clear responsibilities and a system of performance evaluations used to determine annual bonuses . At the time , most Chinese enterprises distributed bonuses of equal size to all employees , there was little sense of responsibility , and workers waited passively for superiors to issue instructions . When Yang took over Lenovo 's personal computer division , he strongly discouraged the use of formal titles and required staff to address each other by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their offices each morning to greet their employees while carrying signs with their first names . When Yang 's division moved to a new building in 1997 , he used the move to break Lenovo 's cultural links to the past by insisting on a more formal dress code and training all employees in telephone etiquette ; Yang wanted his people to think and act like high-tech workers in developed markets . After addressing , human resources issues , Yang moved on to distribution . Due to China 's large territory , large population , varying degrees of economic development , and widely different local regulations , Lenovo was having difficulty operating nationwide . While Lenovo had been using direct sales and a network of distributors , Yang gave up on direct sales in favor of exclusively using independent agents in order to avoid the costs of administering a complex sales network . This action resulted in Lenovo cutting its sales staff from over 100 to just 18 in 1994 . In order to gain the confidence among distributors , Lenovo provided a wide range of products , offered reasonable prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to look out for the interests of distributors . In contrast to Lenovo , foreign firms often tried to squeeze distributors ' margins . Yang made sure that distributors were properly trained and brought in Microsoft and Intel to help with these efforts . Yang also set up a system to monitor the sales , inventory , cash flow , compliance , and pricing of distributors . Many analysts cite Lenovo 's distribution system and after sales service as the key to its expansion . Yang Yuanqing was chairman of Lenovo 's board from 2004 to 2008 . In February 2009 , Yang gave up his position as chairman and again became CEO at Lenovo . In 2005 , Yang Yuanqing began to position Lenovo to become a key ally of Microsoft . Using his substantial influence in China 's technology industry Yang was able to assist Microsoft with fighting piracy of its software . Microsoft had difficulty with this issue for years . A key problem was that most consumers purchased computers with no pre-loaded operating system and later loaded pirated versions of Microsoft 's Windows operating system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for assistance combating piracy . Over the following months Yang worked out a deal with Microsoft China executives . Microsoft agreed to offer a rebate on Windows and marketing assistance in return for preloading it on most Lenovo computers sold in China . Yang was counting on other manufacturers to do the same . Due to government pressure they did so . Microsoft tripled its sales of pre-loaded versions of Windows over the next year . Steve Ballmer said , Yuanqing made a huge difference . He was willing to go out on a limb . Yang also proved to be effective at navigating American politics . In early 2006 , the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo . Critics attempted to smear Lenovo as controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States . Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo . He said , We are not a government-controlled company . He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China 's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment . The State Department deal went through . Yang worried that fears about Lenovo 's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an on-going issue in the United States . Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress . In June of 2006 , Yang arranged to be seated next to C. Richard D'Amato , a member of the congressional committee that had earlier raised concerns about the security of Lenovo 's products . D'Amato later stated that he was impressed with Yang 's candor . The issue soon faded away . While Lenovo 's official language is English , Yang initially did not understand the language well ; he relocated his family to Morrisville in order to improve his language skills and soak up American culture . Yang also hired a private tutor and watched cable news in order to practice . Yang also sent many Lenovo executives to the US for long postings . One American Lenovo executive interviewed by ' ' The Economist ' ' praised Yang for his efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , as of 2013 , Lenovo 's top 14 executives come from seven countries , Lenovo has acquired companies all over the world , and the company has dual headquarters in Beijing and Morrisville , the former home of IBM 's personal computer business . Yang has created a performance culture instead of the traditional Chinese work style of waiting to see what the emperor wants . Yang holds an annual banquet at his home in Beijing for Lenovo 's top executives . Traditionally , each guest at the banquet stands up and uses a toast to set goals for their business unit . Yang has said that when Lenovo enters a new market they intend to be number one . Yang stated , If you do nt have enough scale , if you do nt have enough volume , its hard to make money . If you do nt have enough market share , its hard to make money . Thats why we enter the markets one by one . When we enter a market , we want to quickly get double-digit market share . In 2012 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record profits , which he in-turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo 's employees . According to Lenovo spokesman , Jeffrey Shafer , Yang felt that it would be the right thing to , redirect the money to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done . The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of 2,000 yuan or about US$314 . This was almost equivalent to a month 's pay for the typical Lenovo worker in China . Yang contributed another $3.25 million bonus to 10,000 Lenovo employees in 2013 . Employees in 20 countries benefited from Yang 's gift . 85% of recipients were in mainland China . As in 2013 , these workers were generally hourly production staff . Shafer also said that Yang , who owns about eight percent of Lenovo 's stock , felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company . According to Lenovo 's annual report , Yang earned $14 million , including $5.2 million in bonuses , during the fiscal year that ended in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011 . He previously owned only 70 million shares . In a statement , Yang said , While the transaction is a personal financial matter , I want to be very clear that my decision to make this investment is based on my strong belief in the company 's very bright future . Our culture is built on commitment and ownership we do what we say , and we own what we do . My decision to increase my holdings represents my steadfast belief in these principles . Yang is often referred to as YY by his colleagues at Lenovo. # Awards # Yang was awarded the May Fourth Youth Medal , by the All-China Youth Federation in 1999 .

1375514 The sculptures in the Schnbrunn Garden at Schnbrunn Palace in Vienna , Austria were created between 1773 and 1780 under the direction of Johann Wilhelm Beyer , a German artist and garden designer . The Great Parterre of Schnbrunn Garden is lined on both sides with 32 over life-size sculptures that represent mythological deities and virtues . The ' ' Neptune Fountain ' ' at the foot of the Gloriette hill is the crowning monument of the Great Parterre . Other sculptures are distributed throughout the garden and palace forecourt , including fountains and pools .

1395514 MEROPS is an on-line database for peptidases ( also known as proteases ) and their inhibitors . The classification scheme for peptidases was published by Rawlings &amp; Barrett in 1993 , and that for protein inhibitors by Rawlings ' ' et al . ' ' in 2004. # Overview # The classification is based on similarities at the tertiary and primary structural levels . Comparisons are restricted to that part of the sequence directly involved in the reaction , which in the case of a peptidase must include the active site , and for a protein inhibitor the reactive site . The classification is hierarchical : sequences are assembled into families , and families are assembled into clans . A family is assembled around a ' ' type example ' ' , the sequence of a well-characterized peptidase or inhibitor . All other sequences in the family must be related to the family type example , either directly or through a transitive relationship involving one or more sequences already shown to be family members . Typically , FastA or BlastP are used to establish sequence relationships , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistically significant . A clan is also assembled around a type example , this being the structure of a well-characterized peptidase or inhibitor . A family is included in a clan if the tertiary structure of a family member can be shown to be related to that of the clan type example . Typically , DALI is used to establish clan membership , with a z score of 6.00 standard deviation units or above considered to be statistically significant . For peptidases , other evidence to indicate that families are related when a tertiary structure is absent includes the same order of catalytic residues in the sequences .

1421514 This family represents the SL1 RNA . SL1 is commonly located in the spacer region between 5S-rRNA genes where it is involved in trans-splicing . Trans-splicing is a form of RNA processing . The acquisition of a spliced leader from an SL RNA is an intra-molecular reaction which precisely joins exons derived from separately transcribed RNAs .

1435514 The Central Division of New South Wales is one of the three divisions of New South Wales along with the Eastern and Western divisions , established under the Crown Lands Act of 1884 for the purposes of land management . In 1907 , it included the Hay , Forbes , Dubbo and Moree land boards , as well as the western parts of the Wagga Wagga and Tamworth land boards . Part of its western boundary is the Lachlan River , and it includes a large part of the Riverina. 
1438514 Analog device is usually a combination of both analog machine and analog media that can together measure , record , or reproduce ( emit ) continuous information , for example , the almost infinite number of grades of transparency , voltage , resistance , rotation , or pressure . In theory , the continuous information ( also analog signal ) has an infinite number of possible values with the only limitation on resolution being the accuracy of the analog device . # Examples # # Non-electrical # There are notable non-electrical analog devices , such as clocks ( sundials , water clocks , pendulum clocks , analog watches ) , the astrolabe , slide rules , the governor of a steam engine , the planimeter ( a simple device that measures the area of a closed shape ) , Kelvin 's mechanical tide predictor , acoustic rangefinders , servomechanisms ( e.g. the thermostat ) , a simple mercury thermometer , a bathroom scale , and the speedometer of a car . # Electrical # The telautograph is an analogue precursor to the modern fax machine . Basically it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a pen , thus being able to reproduce a drawing or signature made by the sender at the receiver 's station . It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper ; previous inventions in Europe used rotating drums to make such transmissions . An analog synthesizer is a synthesizer that uses analog circuits and analog computer techniques to generate sound electronically . The analog television encodes television and transports the picture and sound information as an analogue signal , that is , by varying the amplitude and/or frequencies of the broadcast signal . All systems preceding digital television , such as NTSC , PAL or UNIT are analog television systems . An analog computer is a form of computer that uses electrical , mechanical or hydraulic phenomena to model the problem being solved . More generally an analog computer uses one kind of physical quantity to represent the behaviour of another physical system , or mathematical function . Modeling a real physical system in a computer is called simulation . # Interfacing the digital and analog worlds # In electronics , a digital-to-analog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting a digital signal ( usually binary ) to an analog signal ( current , voltage or electric charge ) . Digital-to-analog converters are interfaces between the digital world and analog world . An analog-to-digital converter ( abbreviated ADC , A/D or A to D ) is an electronic circuit that converts continuous signals to discrete digital numbers . # Controversy over photographic film # There is quite a bit of controversy in the photographic world as to whether or not a film camera should be considered an analog device since the photographic film is n't a truly analog recording medium and requires chemistry to process an image . Analog has become the common term for referring to cameras that are not digital and is an easy shorthand for people to differentiate between the two mediums .

1538514 birthplace = Glen Ridge , New Jersey , United States deathplace = Vienna , Austria Count Alexander Sascha Joseph von Kolowrat-Krakowsky ( 29 January 1886 December 4 , 1927 ) , was an American-born Austrian film producer of Bohemian-Czech descent . A pioneer of Austrian cinema , he founded the first major film studio ' ' Sascha-Film ' ' in Vienna . # Life # He was born in Glen Ridge , New Jersey , the son of Count Leopold Philipp von Kolowrat-Krakowsky ( 18521910 ) and his wife Nadine Freiin von Huppmann-Valbella ( 18581942 ) , the daughter of a Saint Petersburg cigarette manufacturer . He had three siblings : Bertha , Friedrich and Heinrich . The reason Sascha Kolowrat-Krakowsky was born in the US is described in a letter of March 30 , 1984 from his nephew Count Colloredo-Mansfeld to the Austrian film scholar Walter Fritz : After Count Leopold Kolowrat had been granted a reprieve by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria , the family returned to Austria-Hungary . Sascha Kolowrat studied at the Catholic University of Leuven ( present-day ' ' Katholieke Universiteit Leuven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the German Catholic fraternity ' ' Katholische Academische Verbindung Lovania Leuven ' ' . He served in the army and was able to speak many European languages . After he had met Charles Path in Paris in 1909 , he got into cinematography , besides his interests in motorcycle and car racing , aviation and ballooning . In 1909 , he privately filmed a car racing at the Semmering Pass . After the death of his father in 1910 and the inheritance of his estates in Bohemia , Alexander Kolowrat founded the Sascha-Film factory and a film laboratory at his castle Gro Meierhfen ( today ' ' Velk Dvorce ' ' ) in Pfraumberg ( ' ' Pimda ' ' ) . In 1912 , he moved to Vienna and founded the ' ' Sascha-Filmfabrik ' ' on Pappenheimgasse 2/Treustrae in Brigittenau . One of his first productions with Sascha-Film was the documentary ' ' Die Gewinnung des Erzes am steirischen Erzberg in Eisenerz ' ' ( The Ore Mining in the Styrian Erzberg in Eisenerz ) . In 1915 , he took over the film branch of the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in Vienna and also produced several propaganda movies during World War I. Kolowrat-Krakowsky discovered many actors , e.g. Marlene Dietrich and Willi Forst , who both performed in the 1927 silent film ' ' Caf Elektric ' ' directed by Gustav Ucicky . He did important pioneering work in all film genres of the time . The high points of his artistic work were the productions of monumental silent movies like ' ' Sodom and Gomorrah ' ' ( 1922 ) or ' ' Die Sklavenknigin ' ' ( 1924 ) , both directed by Michael Curtiz , on the ' ' Laaer Berg ' ' in Vienna-Favoriten . In 1916 , he erected Austria 's first huge studio in Vienna-Sievering . Together with his Sascha-Film company , he was the owner of several cinemas . He personally loved to attend the Mnstedt Cinema in the Prater park , as well as the Burgkino and the Opernkino . In the Vienna Prater , west of the Rotunde , he erected Old London in 1920 for film shots , similar to the Venice in Vienna theme park nearby , but smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square in Prague .

Other elements fought in Gabon and Eritrea before the various units were organized under British sponsorship as the 1st Free French Light Division in May 1941 near Tel Aviv . From 8 June - 11 July 1941 , the division fought with British forces to remove the Vichy authorities from power in the Levant . The division was then disbanded in August 1941 , but the component units continued to serve with the Allied forces .

During the course of the war , the division would be officially renamed the 1st Motorized Infantry Division and finally the 1st March Infantry Division . In August 1944 , the division landed in southern France as part of the follow-on troops of Operation Dragoon , and fought as part of the French 1st Army , through Provence and the Vosges Mountains , and into Alsace . In January 1945 , the division defended the area south of Strasbourg at heavy cost , losing the 24th March Battalion during desperate fighting against an offensive by the German 19 . ' ' Armee ' ' .

1563514 Cystadenocarcinoma is a malignant form of a cystadenoma and is a malignant neoplasm derived from glandular epithelium , in which cystic accumulations of retained secretions are formed . The neoplastic cells manifest varying degrees of anaplasia and invasiveness , and local extension and metastases occur . Cystadenocarcinomas develop frequently in the ovaries , where pseudomucinous and serous types are recognized . Similar tumor histology has also been reported in the pancreas , although it is a considerably more rare entity . It is the most common malignant ovarian tumor . Contains complex multi-loculated cyst but with exuberant solid areas in places . It usually presents with omental metastases which cause ascites.

1637514 The Defence Fire and Rescue Service is the primary firefighting and rescue service protecting British defence estates and property . Along with the Royal Air Force Rescue and Firefighting Service , it forms the Ministry of Defence Fire Services . # History # The Ministry of Defence Fire Service was formed on 1 April 1991 by the amalgamation of the Navy Department Fire Prevention Service , Army Department Fire Service , Air Force Department Fire Service and Procurement Executive Fire Service . It was later renamed the Defence Fire Service . It was a civilian organisation which protected mainly domestic sites at RAF , Army and Navy installations . It later became part of a similarly named umbrella body , the Ministry of Defence Fire Services , which also included the RAF Firefighting and Rescue Service , a military organisation which protected mainly RAF airfields and runways . The Defence Fire Service was renamed the Defence Fire and Rescue Service in 2004 following the introduction of the Fire and Rescue Services Act . The Act , among other things , acknowledges that Fire Brigades in the UK do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed their names from Fire Services to Fire &amp; Rescue Services during this period . The name change only applies to the civilian fire service , the Royal Air Force Fire Service still remains a separate organisation . # Firefighting and rescue # Both civilian and RAF fire crews are trained in exactly the same way . The training is in line with their local authority fire service counterparts . Traditionally RAF crews were specialists skilled at dealing with live aircraft munitions and airfield crash rescue operations , but they also provided Fire Prevention and Domestic firefighting response on RAF bases and assisted local civilian brigades when called upon . There was , also , often a cross over of roles with civilian Defence Fire Service crews protecting some air bases , and RAF crews protecting purely domestic ( non-flying ) units . In the RAF , airmen and women receive their basic military training before going on to train in various trades or areas of expertise such as mechanics , pilots , electricians , navigators , etc . Firefighting is a trade therefore which some airmen/women choose to be trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Defence Fire Training and Development Centre ( was FSCTE ) at the former RAF Manston in Kent . Originally the Air Ministry Fire Training School , in 2007 DFTDC became part of the newly created Defence Fire Risk Management Organisation ( DFRMO ) at Andover , under the command of HQ Land Forces . # Over the fence response # As a general rule the Defence Fire and Rescue Service only operate within the confines of the site it is protects . However it is a fire service recognised by the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 citatation required and as such it has jurisdiction and powers of entry just like any other local authority fire service at incidents involving fire or risk to life . As such there are often local agreements for MoD fire services to cover a certain area around the site they protect and can be called for assistance by their local authority fire service colleagues as and when required . # Other responsibilities # The new MoD fire service is a Fire Authority in its own right , citation required , and is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The Regulatory Reform ( Fire Safety ) Order 2005 ) at all defence sites .

1643514 The California Walnut Board or Walnut Marketing Board , founded in 1933 , supports the California walnut industry . The organization was originally known as the Walnut Control Board , changing its name to the Walnut Marketing Board in 1962 and to the California Walnut Board in 2008 . Its formation was authorized by the Agricultural Adjustment Act ( AAA ) . Under the AAA , the Walnut Control Board was authorized to assess crops and declare a percentage as surplus . Its 1934 assessment designating 30% of the crop as surplus met with local resistance . In 2009 , responding to a request from the Board , the United States Department of Agriculture purchased $30 million of the crop , which was distributed to nutrition assistance programs . The AAA 's application to walnuts was affirmed by Federal Marketing Order 984 in 1948 . The USDA and the organization date its foundation to that year . Its activities now include the promotion of walnuts in the US diet , research funding , product grading , and compilation of crop statistics . The USDA oversees its operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 , concluded that its cost-benefit ratio was favorable. 
1646514 Hollyford Valley is a valley in Fiordland , New Zealand , in the southwest of the South Island . It is named for the Hollyford River , which runs north-north-west along its length from the Southern Alps to the Tasman Sea . Beech forest dominates both the slopes and the bottom of the valley . Historically very remote , there is still only one road into the valley , Milford Road , which approaches the valley from the south from Te Anau , but turns towards Homer 's Saddle into Milford Sound long before reaching the coast . The turnoff site , a former roadworkers camp , sports a small museum and is a starting point for a number of tramping ( hiking ) routes , with about 2,000 people per year exploring the Hollyford Valley backcountry. # Haast-Hollyford road # In 2010 , plans resurfaced to construct a road from this turnoff towards Haast , following first the river and then travelling along the rugged coastline . Such a road had previously been mooted as far back as the 1870s , but had always been considered too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a privately funded report estimates that a toll road could be built for between $225315 million . The proponents claim that the road should have Road of National Significance status , as it would be useful for tourism in the area , and could reduce the time it takes to travel to Milford Sound , a major constraint on local tourism growth . However , the road plan is being criticised by conservation groups , some who consider it a smokescreen for more commercial exploitation of the National Park areas , linking it to plans by the National Party to allow mining on conservation land again . In early March 2010 , the government announced that at the current proposed cost , and with the level of tourism benefits likely , the road was a low priority project , and the proposal would not be taken further at this stage . # Milford Dart Tunnel # A proposal for a Milford Dart Tunnel private coach road was approved in principle by the Minister for Conservation in 2012 , against the advice of the relevant regional conservation boards . There is concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's previously isolated botany and fauna , in particular that run-off from the tunnel construction site might foul the pristine Hollyford River . The Milford Dart Ltd company 's 11.3 kilometre tunnel would run from Glenorchy into the Hollyford Valley The proposal has been slightly amended since its introduction in 2011 but concern remains that making the unspoilt natural area , which attracts more adventurous sightseers and hikers , more road accessible may compromise both conservation and , in the longer term , the attractiveness of the remote area . # References #

1699514 runtime = 92 minutes ' ' 12:01 ' ' is a 1993 television film directed by Jack Sholder , and starring Helen Slater , Jonathan Silverman , Jeremy Piven , and Martin Landau . It originally aired on the Fox Network in the United States . It is an adaptation of Richard Lupoff 's short story 12:01 PM , published in the December 1973 , issue of ' ' The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction ' ' . The story had previously been adapted into an 1990 Academy Award nominated short film starring Kurtwood Smith . # Plot # Barry Thomas is bored with his job and moons over high profile scientist Lisa Fredericks . On the way home , Barry sees Lisa fatally shot and takes it very hard . While at home at midnight , he receives a strong electrical shock . The next morning the events of the previous day are repeating themselves and Barry is the only one who realizes that the world is stuck in a time loop . During several repetitions , Barry figures out how to save Lisa and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrested for knowing too much about events . Barry and Lisa eventually learns that her boss , Dr. Thadius Moxley , is conducting illegal and unethical experiments with faster-than-light particle acceleration that have caused the time loop . In fact , it was Lisa 's partial knowledge of Dr. Moxleys illegal activities that resulted in her murder by his henchmen . After getting involved with an undercover government agent , they must stop her boss from starting his experiment at the end of a loop or the world will be trapped forever repeating the same day . Expanding on the original 's premise of a one hour time loop , this version saw the main character reliving the same 24-hour period , which would restart at one minute past midnight ( rather than midday as in the other versions ) . It also contains a pseudo-happy ending , as the protagonist ultimately finds a way to correct the time loop over the course of the films 92-minute running time . # Release # The movie was released on DVD in the United States on November 28 , 2006. # Legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has a similar time loop premise , was also released in 1993 . The writers and producers of ' ' 12:01 ' ' believed their work was stolen by ' ' Groundhog Day ' ' . According to Richard Lupoff : : A brilliant young filmmaker named Jonathan Heap made a superb 30-minute version of my short story 12:01 PM . It was an Oscar nominee in 1990 , and was later adapted ( very loosely ) into a two-hour Fox movie called ' ' 12:01 ' ' . The story was also adapted -- actually plagiarized -- into a major theatrical film in 1993 . Jonathan Heap and I were outraged and tried very hard to go after the rascals who had robbed us , but alas , the Hollywood establishment closed ranks . We were no Art Buchwald . After half a year of lawyers ' conferences and emotional stress , we agreed to put the matter behind us and get on with our lives 
1709514 The Hortobgyi palacsinta is a savoury Hungarian pancake , filled with meat ( usually veal ) . The meat is prepared as a stew ; minced meat is fried with onions and spices like the prklt or the papriks dish , using , veal , veal with mushrooms , chicken or Hungarian sausage . The pancakes are filled with the minced meat , tucking in the ends , and are baked in the oven with a pepper and sour cream , then topped with fresh parsley . The dish actually does not originate from the Hortobgy National Park region of the Great Hungarian Plain and has nothing to do with Hortobgy . It was originally invented for the 1958 Brussels World Fair . However some Hungarian recipe books already featured a similar recipe in the 1930s . The name of the food is simply a marketing trick . 
1728514 The Huanren frog , ' ' Rana huanrensis ' ' , is a species of true frog found in East Asia . It was originally believed to be endemic to Huanren County , Liaoning , China , but was later also found in South Korea ; it is presumed to be present in North Korea , as well . It is closely related to the Dybowski 's frog , ' ' Rana dybowskii ' ' , and specimens collected before 1991 were incorrectly identified as that species . Distinguishing factors include the absence of a vocal sac . The Huanren frog is found in and around rivers and streams in hilly terrain . The type locality in Huanren is 520m ft above sea level , and specimens from Korea have also only been found at altitudes over 500m ft . Specimens from South Korea have been collected in the provinces of Gangwon-do , Gyeongsangbuk-do , and eastern Gyeonggi-do . Egg clutches , which are small and clustered , are deposited on submerged rocks in the streams which this species favors.

A monument marking the significance of the spot was unveiled in a ceremony on 3 September 2006 . It is hoped that it will become a tourist attraction . The site lies just to the west of the large lake Skjkervatnet. # Method of calculation # Harald Stavestrand at the Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority looked for the balancing point of mainland Norway with its islands , not including sea area , the overseas areas of Svalbard and Jan Mayen , or considering elevation .

1849514 Tobiah was an Ammonite official ( possibly a governor of Ammon , possibly also of Jewish descent ) who incited the Ammonites to hinder Nehemiah 's efforts to rebuild Jerusalem . He , along with Sanballat the Horonite and Geshem the Arab , resorted to a stratagem , and , pretending to wish a conference with Nehemiah , invited him to meet them at Ono , Benjamin . Four times they made the request , and every time Nehemiah refused to come . Their object was to frighten him from completing the restoration of Jerusalem 's walls and to do him some kind of harm . Tobiah also had married a daughter of Shecaniah , a Judahite leader , and had given his son , Jehohanan , in marriage to the daughter of Meshullam , another Judahite leader , for ostensibly political purposes . Because of this , he somehow gained enough of a Judahite coalition to use the Judahites themselves to send letters to Nehemiah , telling him of Tobiah 's good deeds in an apparent attempt to weaken Nehemiah 's resolve to keep Tobiah out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nehemiah . Additionally , Tobiah had established a close relationship with Eliashib the High Priest , whose grandson had married the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite , such that Eliashib leased the storerooms of the temple , intended to be filled with the Israelite 's grain offerings , incense , temple articles , and the tithes of grain , new wine and oil meant for the work of the temple and the temple workers themselves , so that Tobiah could conduct business in the newly constructed temple . Upon hearing this , Nehemiah , who was then in Babylon serving Artaxerxes I , requested permission to return to Judah . After returning , he promptly threw all of Tobiah 's belongings out of the temple room , purified the room , and put back all that had originally been there . It is possible , though uncertain , that Tobiah the Ammonite may be related to other Tobiahs mentioned in extra-biblical sources . The Lachish Ostraca mention a Tobiah who is a servant of the king . Josephus later mentions a rich and influential Tobiad family from around the geographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise related to this same Tobiah.

1941514 ' ' Heavens Cafe ' ' is a rock opera written and composed by John Miner . It was first staged in Las Vegas , Nevada in 1996 . The opportunity to perform the musical theater project came after his demo was heard by investor Mike Lewis of Las Vegas-based Tributary Music Label after his departure from California-based progressive rock group Mantra Sunrise . Miner put a new band together Art Rock Circus with drummer Jon Weisberg and Jon Cornell to stage the live performances at the Flamingo Theater in Las Vegas . Former Follies Bergere performer Kristine Keppel directed the original casting . In 2003 , Los Angeles based theater director John Beane , approached John Miner about staging the opera in the Los Angeles area later that year . Beane 's new vision for the project came to fruition in May 2004 with a six-week California run at the Insurgo Theater which included Ken Jaquess on bass and on drums . Art Rock Circus continues to perform and record music as recent as 2007. # Synopsis # The Classical Man suffers an untimely death and arrives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is here he meets his previous self ( Classical Man ) , his current incarnation ( Lark ) , and his future potential self ( Robin ) . Along his suspenseful journey through the afterlife , he is accompanied by his protective angel ( Guardian Angel ) , and the protagonistic negative force ( Devil ) . His alter ego ( Kral , Lark spelled backwards ) is the caretaker of the coffee house where much of the opera takes place . Kral also acts as the comic relief of the play . Once the lead character ( Lark ) leaves the cafe ' , he embarks on a soul-searching journey in quest of the mysterious Tower of Information where he hopes to find all the unanswered questions he has remaining about the meaning of life and the purpose of existence . After finding out that he can not proceed past The Tower he finds himself lost without a cause until he finds the beautiful Robin in the play 's dream within a dream sequence , and falls in love with her energy and beauty . They consummate their love in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the next earthly reincarnation now as the baby Robin at the plays end . # Analysis # Some critics have drawn parallels to Miner 's rock opera as ' ' A Christmas Carol ' ' meets ' ' The Wonderful Wizard of Oz ' ' The tower itself is not a far cry from the elusive city of OZ and the idea of meeting different aspects of past and present would bring to mind A Christmas Carol . Miner 's dabbling in metaphysics as exemplified in earlier works from his band Mantra Sunrise would suggest such concepts put to rock music . The release of a CD recording of the live Las Vegas performances on the Tributary Music Label in 1998 found a healthy audience in the progressive rock music scene . The album received much attention around the world in progressive rock fanzines and radio shows . A five-page article highlighted both the Las Vegas and Los Angeles shows in the industry magazine ' ' Progression Magazine ' ' ( issue #46 2004 ) . # Cast of characters # *Classical Man *Guardian Angel *Lark *Robin *Kral *Devil

1960514 The Harrison P. Young House is a home in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park , Illinois , United States . The 1870s era building was remodeled extensively by famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright , early in his career , in 1895 . The home 's remodeling incorporated elements that would later be found in Wright 's pioneering , early modern Prairie style . Some of the remodel work included setting the home back an additional 16 ft ( 4.88 m ) from the street and an overhanging porch over the driveway . The House is similar in some ways to Wright 's other early work and was influenced by his first teacher , Joseph Silsbee . The house is considered a contributing property to both a local and federally Registered Historic District . # Architecture # The Harrison P. Young House was first built during the 1870s for Harrison P. Young based upon a design by William E. Coman . In 1895 it was remodeled by famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright for the same client . The Young House is atypical to the other design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its steeply pitched roof is closely identified with some of his other early work . The Young House was perhaps most influenced by Wright 's design for the Nathan G. Moore House , which was designed during the same period in a Tudor Revival style . Wright 's 1895 remodel was significant and included structural modifications ; before any other work began the house was pushed back an additional 16 ft ( 4.88 m ) from the street . Following on , Wright affixed a large addition to the home , faced with narrow banded clapboarding ( found in much of Wright 's early work ) , the addition held a new living room , second-floor bedroom and a large porch . Wright 's sweeping , utilitarian porch overhangs , meant to allow access to the carriage during the rain , were cantilevered over the entry drive . It is the sweep of Wright 's eaves , throughout the remodel , that give the home a distinctly modern Wrightian character . The high-pitched gabled roof is reminiscent of the roof lines in the Irving Clark House in suburban LaGrange , Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house is bisected by another perpendicular gable . Both homes also feature prominent chimneys constructed from Roman brick . Chimneys such as these became hallmarks of Wright 's Prairie style work and of his work throughout his career . The large chimney is symbolic of the significance of the hearth in a warm , family-centered environment . In the Young House some of the elements that Wright would go to use in his signature early modern Prairie style are recognizable . The most obvious element which is immediately visible is the thin , narrow clapboarding , which provides some of the horizontal emphasis for which Prairie style is known . Other features are more representative of Wright 's earliest work with architect Joseph Silsbee , such as the soaring roof lines . # Significance # The house is most significant for the preview it gives of Wright 's Prairie style , and the home utilizes many elements that would later become an important part of that school . The house is also recognized by the United States federal government as a contributing property to the Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its own , local version of the federal historic district and the Young House is part of that district as well . The federal Frank Lloyd Wright Historic District was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on December 4 , 1973.

2005514 licenceexpires = The is a nuclear power plant located in the town of i , Fukui Prefecture , managed by the Kansai Electric Power Company . The site is 1.88 km2. i Units 3 and 4 were Japan 's the last operating nuclear power plants . # Reactors on site # # History # # December 2005 # On 22 December 2005 , at 8:50am there was trouble with a power line due to strong winds and heavy snow , the reactor was shut down as a result . # July 2011 # On 15 July 2011 , Kansai Electric announced that two more nuclear power reactors in Fukui Prefecture would be shut down for regular inspections . The result of this decision was that 6 reactors were shut down , over half the utility 's 11 reactors . The No. 4 reactor of the plant in Takahama Town will be brought to a halt for regular inspections on 21 July , and the No. 4 reactor of the plant in Oh Town , on 22 July . Regular inspections are nearly complete at two other reactors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress tests for the nation 's nuclear plants leaves it unclear when they could be brought back on line . On 15 July 2011 , the pressure in a tank with boric-acid dropped unexpectedly . This tank injects water into the reactor in the event of an emergency . This made it impossible to inject water in a proper way into the No. 1 reactor . The reactor would be manually shut down around 9 PM on 16 July to look into the cause of the problem , although pressure returned to normal in about one hour . It was said that the trouble did not cause any leak of radioactive substances to the outside . # August 2011 # In August 2011 citizens of the prefecture Shiga , at the banks of Lake Biwa , started a lawsuit at the Otsu District Court , and asked a court order to prevent the restart of seven reactors operated by Kansai Electric Power Company , in the prefecture Fukui. # December 2011 # On 16 December 2011 Kansai Electric Power Company halted the No.2 reactor for a 4-month safety check . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no. 3 and no. 4 were approved after a meeting on 9 February 2012 of a panel of nuclear experts . The report said that the tests on the reactors were conducted appropriately and measures for earthquakes and tsunami were in place at the plant . These results would be submitted to NISA as early as 13 February 2012 , after the briefing of minister Yukio Edano of Economy , Trade and Industry . But the local governments of the prefecture Fukui and the town i were still very cautious about restarting the reactors , to their minds the stress tests had little priority , and they urged the central government to create new safety standards based on the lessons learned after accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. # March 2012 # On 29 March 2012 the governor Keiji Yamada of Kyoto said to the Japanese Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency that the prefecture would not accept the restart of reactor 3 and 4 at the i nuclear power plant . Officials of the agency did visit Kyoto , to explain that the stress tests on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shiga Yukiko Kada , who was visited later for a likewise explanation , reacted in a similar way : he asked for no hasty decisions . Although the approval of local governments was not legally required , prime minister Noda had made it clear , that the participation of the local communities would be taken into account . Mayor Yamada of Kyoto , with some 67,000 people living in areas within a radius of 30 kilometers from the i power plant , added to his statement : ' ' A safety standard that reflects technical knowledge learned from the accident at Tokyo Electric 's Fukushima Daiichi power plant must be presented first . ' ' # April 2012 # To improve the safety at the plant an action plan was designed with a total of 91 possible measures . On 9 April 2012 of this only 54 were already implemented : the earthquake resistance of the power transmission towers was improved , satellite telephone communication was installed , seawater could be taken in to cool the systems . But an earthquake-resistant office building was not to be completed before April 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central control room would act as emergency-management office . Because this place offers only accommodation for some 50 people , experts had doubts about this place . Venting systems to release steam from the containment with filters to remove radioactive isotopes were planned to be built in 2015 . The dam that would offer better protection against tsunamis was to be finished around March 2014 . On 13 April 2012 at a meeting of the Japanese government the stress-tests of two reactors of the i nuclear plant and the safety action plan submitted by KEPCO were approved satisfactory and conform safety standards . To prevent the rise of electricity charges and an estimated power shortage of 18% in the summer of 2012 the two reactors needed to be restarted . Industry minister Yukio Edano said , that the 2 reactors were safe enough to be restarted and there was a need for their resumption . # May 2012 # On 1 May 2012 Tetsuya Yamamoto , head of the nuclear crisis management team of NISA , said at a meeting at the Kyoto prefectural hall , that the Japanese government will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be involved with this . The head of the Kyoto crisis team , did not accept this explanation , and said that the government explanation is inconsistent with the demands of local people . On 14 May 2012 Oi assembly says yes to restarting reactors . The assembly made the decision in consideration of the economic damage that a prolonged suspension could cause and conveyed its view to Oi Mayor Shinobu Tokioka later in the day . The mayor was set to make a decision on whether to approve the restarts after reflecting on the assembly 's conclusion and the results of the appraisal made by Fukui 's nuclear safety commission and other matters . The decision will then be conveyed to Fukui Gov . Issei Nishikawa . The assembly 's decision followed an 11-1 vote in favor of restarting the reactors . One assembly member was absent due to illness . # July 2012 # Reactor #3 was restarted on 1 July and reached criticality on 2 July 2012 .

Digging and boring surveys gave no indication of danger . According to Mitsuhisa Watanabe , tectonic geomorphology professor at Tokyo University , the fault poses security risks when the nuclear reactors continue to operate , and the seismic threat was underestimated by the authorities . An on-site inspection by the Nuclear Regulation Authority was scheduled for 2 November 2012. # March 2013 # On 19 March 2013 the NRA announced that it would check the power plant on the site according to the new safety standards , before their introduction in July 2013 , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , than continued operation until September would be authorized by the NRA . After this date the reactors needed their routine maintenance .

But the NRA intended to do a close examination . # June 2013 # In the first weeks of June 2013 a team of inspectors , including NRA Commissioner Toyoshi Fuketa , examined the two operating reactors . # July 2013 # On 3 July 2013 the NRA allowed the plant to keep the two operating reactors on line , although on 8 July new safety requirements for atomic plants would take effect . The NRA saw no serious problems at that moment . After September because of the mandatory routine checks the reactors would be taken offline .

Her brother , Ricky Wilde , continued to serve as her producer , though was now assisted by their father , Marty Wilde , who also continued to co-write material . For the first time , Kim Wilde also received a co-producer credit and the album also marked the first time in which she earned a sole songwriting credit , for the tracks Fit In and Shangri-la . Three singles were taken from the album . The Second Time reached the UK Top 30 and the Top 10 in Germany , as well as becoming only her second single to reach the US Billboard Hot 100 , where it was retitled Go For It and peaked at No. 65 .

She changed from a girl wearing secondhand clothes with self-dyed hair , to a Barbarella-inspired sci-fi heroine ( by XL Design ) for the cover of The Second Time . Though initially only for the single , MCA Records decided to use the new image for the album cover also , which Wilde objected to . She later cited the album sleeve as one of the reasons for its weak sales , stating that it confused her audience who still regarded her as the girl-next-door . For subsequent single releases from the album , Wilde switched back to an image she felt more identifiable with . For the Rage to Love promotion , she wore one of her father 's Teddy Boy jackets ; in keeping with the rockabilly retro theme of the song . # Critical response # ' ' Billboard ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge and described the sound as somewhere between Sheena Easton and Debbie Harry .

However , the reviewer reserved praise for Kim 's self-written efforts , writing that Fit In and Shangri-La have the passive , yearning tone of a jailhouse diary and expressed hope that the vivacious , earnest singer might be smart enough to cut loose her puppet strings . . # Track listing # All tracks written by Ricki Wilde/Marty Wilde , unless otherwise noted . # The Touch 4:13 # Is It Over 3:56 # Suburbs of Moscow 3:24 # Fit In ( Kim Wilde ) 4:38 # Rage to Love 4:20 # The Second Time 3:54 # Bladerunner 4:29 # Janine 3:47 # Shangri-La ( Kim Wilde ) 4:49 # Thought It Was Goodbye ( Kim Wilde , Ricki Wilde , Marty Wilde ) 4:38 Is It Over is featured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2010 Remastered CD Edition ) # # Lovers on a Beach ( The Second Time B-side ) # Shangri-La ( Alternative Version ) # Putty in Your Hands ( Rage to Love B-side ) # Turn It On ( from Weird Science Soundtrack ) # The Second Time ( 7 Version ) # The Touch ( 7 Version ) # Rage to Love ( 7 Version ) # Bonus CD ( 2010 Remastered CD Edition ) # # The Second Time ( 12 Version ) # Lovers on a Beach ( 12 Version ) # Go For It ( Extended Dance Version ) # The Touch ( 12 Version ) # Shangri-La ( 12 Version ) # Go For It ( Dub Version ) # Rage To Love ( 12 Version ) # Shangri-La ( Special Re-Mix ) # The Second Time ( US Remix ) # Personnel # *Kim Wilde vocals , arranger , producer , solina , dx-7 , mini-moog , Roland System 700m , Roland Jupiter 8 , Polyfusion Modular system , Emu Emulator II , Fairlight CMI , Buchla Series 200 , Memorymoog , Oberheim ob-8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arranger , backing vocals *Ricki Wilde producer , bass , harmonica , arranger , programming , backing vocals , synclavier , solina , dx-7 , jupiter 8 , mini-moog , fender jazz bass , guitar *Steve Byrd guitar , backing vocals *Andy Duncan percussion *Christopher North drums *Nigel Mills engineer *Gary Twigg bass *John Shaw photography # Chart performance # # Album # ' ' Teases &amp; Dares ' ' spent only two weeks in the UK Albums Chart , entering at number 66 for the week-ending 17 November 1984 , and falling to number 79 the week after .

That same year , Sands debuted on Cameo-Parkway Records and would continue the pattern of songs introduced by Sands becoming successful for other artists , when in 1967 , Sands ' latest single , the Chip Taylor-penned Angel of the Morning , got caught up in label 's business problems . Despite the single being one of the most-requested radio songs wherever played , and the initial 10,000 copies selling out , the label 's pending bankruptcy aborted the record 's potential success ; a few months later , the unknown Merrilee Rush would score a Top Ten single with the song . Sands ' last single release on Cameo-Parkway was Billy Sunshine in January 1968 , the tracking reaching ' ' Billboard s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart before Cameo 's demise . In 1969 Sands scored with the A&amp;M single Any Way That You Want Me , a Chip Taylor composition previously recorded by both the American Breed and the Troggs in 1966 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Any Way That You Want Me also reached the Top Ten or better in Columbus , Ohio , Houston , Texas , San Diego , California , and a number of other cities ; it reached No. 53 ' ' Billboard ' ' Hot 100 , tying Don Ho 's Tiny Bubbles for longevity among 1960s singles failing to reach that chart 's top 50 ( at 17 weeks ) , and eventual sales are estimated at 500,000 units . Sands ' debut album , also named ' ' Any Way That You Want Me ' ' , was released on A&amp;M in 1970 , several months after the single had peaked . Evie made her recorded debut as a songwriter on the album with It 's This I Am - covered years later by Beck and Beth Orton , respectively . A Sands album to be produced by Val Garay for Buddah Records was announced in March 1971 but did not come to fruition : rather the 1975 release ' ' Estate of Mind ' ' on the Capitol Records Haven label ended Sands ' five-year absence from recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album marked Sands ' continuing as a songwriter , also collaborating with Richard Germinaro and veteran songwriter Ben Weisman . Two tracks from the album , Lambert and Potter 's You Brought The Woman Out Of Me and the Sands-Weisman-Germinaro collaboration I Love Makin ' Love To You , both approached major hit status . They wound up peaking at No. 50 , with Sands would see the latter included on the ' ' ButterFly ' ' album by Barbra Streisand . Several other Sands songs from the Estate of Mind album were also covered by a number of artists , including Dionne Warwick , Dobie Gray , Dusty Springfield , Frankie Valli , Gladys Knight , Arthur Prysock , The Manhattans , Cher/Gregg Allman , Jose Feliciano and Phyllis Hyman . After a final 1976 single release on Haven : a remake of The Way You Do the Things You Do , Sands next release was on RCA who issued the album ' ' Suspended Animation ' ' - produced by Sands and Michael Stewart in the spring of 1979 ; Sands had actually begun working with co-producer Michael Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members David Hungate , Steve Lukather and Greg Phillinganes , and also Lee Ritenour and Buzz Feiten , and the vocalists backing Sands included Toto frontman Bobby Kimball , Bill Champlin of Chicago and on the track Lady of the Night - Dusty Springfield . Despite its prestigious personnel ' ' Suspended Animation ' ' did n't make a real chart impact for its single releases and Sands focused mostly on writing and production in the music business for almost twenty years . As with her previous album , a few of the songs were covered by several artists , including Helen Reddy , Linda Clfford , Phyllis Hyman , June Pointer , The Weather Girls and Shirley Bassey . Karen Carpenter recorded two songs for her solo album , but they remained unreleased . In 1982 , Sands co-produced ( with Leslie Ann Jones ) the Holly Near album Speed Of Light . The basic band consisted of Adrienne Torf-keyboards , Carrie Barton-bass , Cam Davis-drums and Ray Obiedo- electric and acoustic guitars . Additional musicians and singers included , Sands-electric guitar , acoustic guitar and backing vocals , Sheila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tillery-backing vocals . The album was recorded and mixed in San Francisco , California at The Automatt . In late 1996 , Sands went to see Chip Taylor perform at a club gig and he invited her onstage to perform with him . Despite not having kept actively in touch through the previous years , the experience was so successful that the two re-ignited their collaboration along with Al Gorgoni , resulting in the critically acclaimed ' ' Women In Prison ' ' LP , which was released in 1999 ( and again in 2000 ) on Taylor 's Train Wreck records . A more rootsy project than the blue-eyed soul of her late 1960s-1970s output , the album consisted of various Sands-Taylor-Gorgoni originals , including a duet with Lucinda Williams on the track Cool Blues Story . Several tracks fared well on UK/Euro indie charts . After the reconnection with Taylor , Sands returned to performing in 1998 . Sands and Taylor did some shows in the UK and Europe when the album was released , including London , Glasgow , Brussels and several dates in Holland . Sands ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Any Way ... ' ' and ' ' Estate ... ' ' were reissued in September 2005 and June 2006 respectively , on Creation Records co-founder Joe Foster 's Rev-Ola imprint in the United Kingdom . Evie can currently be found performing her own solo material as well as performing as the lead guitar player in eclectic Los Angeles based group , Adam Marsland 's Chaos Band . Her most recent recorded appearance is on that band 's 2007 live CD ' ' Long Promised Road : Songs of Dennis and Carl Wilson ' ' , on which she sings several lead vocals , including the first-ever released recording of Dennis Wilson 's Would n't It Be Nice to Live Again . She also did extensive vocal and guitar work on Marsland 's 2009 double CD ' ' Go West ' ' , including lead vocals on one track . # Discography # # Albums # * A&amp;M SP-4239 - ' ' Any Way That You Want Me ' ' - 1970 * Haven ST-9202 - ' ' Estate of Mind ' ' - 1974 * RCA Victor AFL1-2943 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Train Wreck TW-009 - ' ' Women in Prison ' ' - 1999 # Singles # * ABC 10458 - The Roll/My Dog 1963 * Gold 215 - Danny Boy , I Love You So/I Was Moved 1964 * Blue Cat 118 - Take Me For A Little While/Run Home To Your Mama - 1965 * Blue Cat 122 - I Ca n't Let Go / Uptight 1965 * Cameo 413 - Picture Me Gone/It Makes Me Laugh - 1966 * Cameo 436 - The Love Of A Boy / We Know Better 1966 * Cameo 475 - Angel Of The Morning / Dear John 1967 * Cameo 2002 - Billy Sunshine / It Makes Me Laugh - 1967 * A&amp;M 0980 - Until It 's Time For You To Go / Shadow Of The Evening 1968 * A&amp;M 1026 - One Fine Summer Morning / I 'll Hold Out My Hand 1969 * A&amp;M 1090 - Any Way That You Want Me / I 'll Never Be Alone Again 1969 - Billboard Hot 100 #53 ( Aug. ) * A&amp;M 1157 - Maybe Tomorrow / Crazy Annie 1969 * A&amp;M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow 1970 - Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 #110 , Billboard AC #30 ( March ) * A&amp;M 1192 - It 's This I Am , I Find / Take Me For A Little While 1970 * Haven 7010 - You Brought The Woman Out Of Me/Early Morning Sunshine - 1974 - Billboard Hot 100 #50 ( March 1975 ) * Haven 7013 - I Love Makin ' Love To You/One Thing On My Mind - 1974 - Billboard Hot 100 #50 ( August 1975 ) * Haven 7020 - Yesterday Ca n't Hurt Me/ ( Am I ) Crazy Cause I Believe - 1975 - Billboard AC #36 ( Dec. ) * Haven 806 - The Way You Do The Things You Do/Love In The Afternoon - 1976 * RCA 11549 - Keep My Love Light Burnin ' / I Ca n't Wait For You - 1979 * RCA 11653 - You Sho ' Look Good To Me / Brain Damage 1979 # References # * * *

However , New Jersey officials opposed this plan , and I-95 was routed to cross the Delaware River on the Scudders Falls Bridge . In 1969 , another plan was created to build a US 13 expressway that would provide a direct connection between I-95 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike ( Interstate 276 ) . It would have run from Exit 40 of I-95 , intersect the PA Turnpike , and head to the southern end of the completed US 13 expressway in Tullytown . It was eventually cancelled due to feared environmental impacts on Silver Lake Park . # Major intersections # notes=Delaware border notes= notes= notes=Interchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlap notes= notes=North end of PA 3 west overlap notes=I-76 Exit 342 ; Brief overlap between US 13 northbound and US 30 westbound notes= notes=Interchange ; south end of US 1 overlap ; southbound exit and northbound entrance notes=Interchange ( Oxford Circle ) notes=North end of US 1 overlap notes= notes=Partial cloverleaf interchange notes= notes=Partial cloverleaf interchange notes= notes=I-276 Exit 358 notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance 
2100514 ' ' The Fury ' ' is the ninth studio album , and seventh under his own name , by musician Gary Numan , released in 1985 . It saw him continuing to explore the sampling-heavy industrial sound he had developed for the previous album ' ' Berserker ' ' in 1984 . The album was his second released under his self-owned Numa Records label . # Overview # Although Numan 's previous album ' ' Berserker ' ' had failed to make a notable commercial impact , Numan decided to continue with a similar sound for his next record . For the second time in his career he decided to team up with other people to produce his album , recruiting The Wave Team ( Mike Smith , Ian Herron ) as his co-producers . Colin Thurston assisted on the production of one track . ' ' The Fury ' ' , as the album was to be called , continued with the highly sampled , metallic , industrial sound heard on ' ' Berserker ' ' but added layers of electronic funk that he had previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1982 ) and ' ' Warriors ' ' ( 1983 ) . The style would become a crucial part of his music as the 1980s progressed . As on ' ' Berserker ' ' , the rhythm section is dominated by aggressive electronic percussion and usage of samples , but the fretless bass that had been an important element on the previous album disappeared almost completely , with only three tracks on the new album featuring a bass . The rhythm elements were balanced with the usage of a PPG Wave synthesiser , saxophonist Dick Morrissey ( who had appeared on ' ' Warriors ' ' ) again provided the more melodic elements , while guitars were virtually non-existent . Tessa Niles and Tracey Ackerman contributed female backing vocals , similar to those already heard on ' ' Berserker ' ' , which would be another continuing theme in Numan 's work until the early 1990s . Of the album , Numan later recalled : The usage of sampling on the album is especially prominent on the album 's anthemic opening track ( and second single ) , Call Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 1982 science fiction movie ' ' Blade Runner ' ' . This marked the beginning of Numan 's fascination with the movie that would also resurface on his next three studio albums , ' ' Strange Charm ' ' in 1986 , ' ' Metal Rhythm ' ' in 1988 , and ' ' Outland ' ' in 1990 . The original album artwork was very much at odds with the music , featuring an oddly Bryan Ferry-like Numan dressed in a white suit with a red bow-tie , posing in a tilted photograph against a white-dominant background , with the album name written on a typeface reminding the viewer of 1950s futurism . Numan later admitted that the cover was completely inappropriate , probably did the album a great disservice and made him look like the man who lost it all at Monte Carlo . Your Fascination , Call Out the Dogs , and Miracles were released as singles in rapid-fire succession in August , September and November 1985 , charting at 46 , 49 , and 49 respectively . This was quite a poor turn-around compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only My Dying Machine had charted lower at 66 ) . Numan blamed the singles ' poor chart placements on the total lack of radio play they had received . In November 1986 a version of I Still Remember was released as a charity single , with all proceeds going to the RSPCA . Numan wrote and sung new lyrics for this version , changing the personal anguish theme of the original for a story of a dog mistreated by its owners and eventually dying at the end of the song . Despite the lack of successful singles , ' ' The Fury ' ' reached number 24 in the UK albums chart , higher than both ' ' Berserker ' ' and the ' ' White Noise ' ' ( 1985 ) live album released earlier the same year . ' ' The Fury ' ' remains the highest-charting album ever released by Numa Records , and was the last of Numan 's albums to reach the UK top 30 until October 2013 with the release of Splinter reaching #20 in the UK Album charts . Numan supported ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour in September and October 1985 . No live albums or videos have been released officially from the tour . # Different releases # The album was originally released in the UK on both LP , CD and cassette . A second cassette version was also available containing extended mixes of all nine tracks ; these extended mixes were released on CD in 1996 . In 1998 the album was issued on CD for the first time in the United States by Cleopatra Records . This release added five bonus tracks , including three alternate versions of songs on the album , and a cover photograph different from the UK release . The following year , the album was reissued on CD in the UK by Eagle Records . This issue also featured five bonus tracks , but dropped the alternate versions in favour of three additional out-takes . This reissue also used a cover artwork similar but not identical to the original UK cover , with Numan 's red bow-tie re-coloured white , amongst other changes . # Track listing # All songs written by Gary Numan , except This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <small> All timings are approximate and will vary slightly with different equipment . </small> # 1985 Numa vinyl release <small> ( NUMA1003 ) </small> # # Call Out The Dogs - 4:42 # This Disease - 4:04 # Your Fascination - 4:46 # Miracles - 3:40 # Pleasure Skin - 4:10 # Creatures - 5:10 # Tricks - 5:43 # God Only Knows - 5:26 # I Still Remember - 4:04 # 1991 Numa CD reissue <small> ( CDNUMA 1003 ) </small> # # Call Out The Dogs - 4:42 # This Disease - 4:04 # Your Fascination - 4:46 # Miracles - 3:40 # Pleasure Skin - 4:10 # Creatures - 5:10 # Tricks - 5:43 # God Only Knows - 5:26 # I Still Remember - 4:04 # 1996 Numa CD reissue <small> ( NUMACDX 1003 ) </small> # # Call Out The Dogs - 6:47 # This Disease - 5:19 # Your Fascination - 5:14 # Miracles - 4:22 # Pleasure Skin - 5:03 # Creatures - 6:40 # Tricks - 6:21 # God Only Knows - 6:38 # I Still Remember - 5:24 * All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running times . # 1998 Cleopatra U.S. CD reissue <small> ( CLP 0389-2 ) </small> # # Call Out The Dogs - 4:42 # This Disease - 4:04 # Your Fascination - 4:46 # Miracles - 3:40 # Pleasure Skin - 4:10 # Creatures - 5:10 # Tricks - 5:43 # God Only Knows - 5:26 # I Still Remember - 4:04 # Call Out The Dogs ( Extended ) - 6:47 # I Still Remember ( 12 Version ) - 5:22 # Anthem - 3:29 # Tribal - 5:57 # The Fear ( ' 95 Remix ) - 6:16 * Tribal is a demo version of Call Out the Dogs . * I Still Remember was released as a single in 1986 for the RSPCA charity with different lyrics .

Though called barbel , it is probably not closely enough related to the typical barbels &amp;ndash ; the core group of ' ' Barbus ' ' &amp;ndash ; to be considered congeneric .

But the Amala is actually a tributary of the Mara River , where ' ' B. altianalis ' ' is found , and ' ' B. procatopus ' ' is thus a junior synonym of it . # Distribution and ecology # The Ripon Barbel inhabits Lake Victoria and its drainage basin and surrounding areas in the East African Rift , including Lake Edward , George , Kyoga and Kivu , and the Ruzizi River down to its delta ( though not adjacent Lake Tanganyika ) and the upper and middle Kagera River . Records from the Tana River are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Burundi , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Kenya , Rwanda , Tanzania and Uganda . It lives in diverse freshwater habitats , from inshore waters of lakes to rapidly flowing rivers . This species is an omnivore , eating water plants , molluscs and fishes . It is fished for sport and food ; its Kagera River population being of some commercial significance . Widespread and apparently rather plentiful for such a large fish due to its ecological tolerance and omnivorous habits , the Ripon Barbel is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN . Local stocks might be temporarily affected by erosion after deforestation increasing turbidity and upsetting the aquatic plant life , and unsustainable growth of the fisheries e.g. along the Kagera must be avoided considering that it is presumably &amp;ndash ; as per its large size and like many relatives &amp;ndash ; slow-growing and takes long to mature . # Footnotes #

2188514 The Church of England , like the other autonomous member churches of the Anglican Communion , has its own system of canon law . The principal body of canon law enacted since the Reformation is the ' ' Book of Canons ' ' approved by the Convocations of Canterbury and York in 1604 and 1606 respectively . There are 151 canons in the collection , some of which reaffirm medieval prescriptions , while others depend on Matthew Parker 's ' ' Book of Advertisements ' ' and the Thirty-nine Articles . They were drawn up in Latin by Richard Bancroft , Bishop of London , and only the Latin text is authoritative . They were published in separate Latin and English editions in 1604 . A few , e.g. canon 37 , were amended in the 19th century . A Canon Law Commission was appointed in 1939 to reconsider the matter of canon law in the Church of England : it held eight sessions between 1943 and 1947 and then issued a report which included a full set of new canons which were subsequently considered by Convocation.

2210514 176 ( Abu Klea ) Battery Royal Artillery is the junior currently-existent regular battery of the Royal Artillery . Its name is pronounced One Seven Six , and the battery is commonly referred to as The Abus , and its members as Abus , after the battery 's Honour Title . The battery is one of the sub-units of 39th Regiment Royal Artillery , part of the British Army . It was formed in 1860 and since then has participated in many campaigns , most notably the Battle of Abu Klea in 1885 , where it earned a Victoria Cross and later its Honour Title . # History # 5 Battery , 15 Brigade , Royal Artillery was officially raised in Gosport on the 1 May 1860 by Captain J. de Havilland , although in reality it first paraded on the 23rd . It spent the next few years garrisoned variously in Ireland , Woolwich , Halifax , Gibraltar , the Channel Islands and Malta , without being involved in any conflicts . In 1884 , the Nile Expeditionary Force was organised with the purpose of relieving General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now renamed as part of an RA reorganisation , 1 Battery , Southern Division , Royal Artillery joined the force at Cairo and equipped with the 2.5 inch RML Mountain Gun ( the Screw Gun ) , and camels for transport . While the main part of the force headed up the River Nile by steamer , a camel corps of about two thousand men was detached to move directly cross-country , at best speed , bypassing the waterfalls along the Nile . Half of the battery was detached to support this column . On 16 January 1885 , a force of approximately 12,000 Mahdists was encountered by the column and engaged on the morning of 17 January in the Battle of Abu Klea . During the battle , the battery 's guns were pushed out to the edge of the British square to fire at the charging enemy . The guns each managed to fire one round of case-shot , cutting down many of the enemy , before they reached the square and engaged in hand-to-hand fighting . Lieutenant D. J. Guthrie was attacked by several Sudanese and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gunner Alfred Smith , saved his life by killing his assailant with the handspike from a gun , and remained standing over him fighting off others . For this act of bravery Gunner Smith was awarded the Victoria Cross , although Lieutenant Guthrie was to die of his wounds . Other decorations for the Battery during this action include two Distinguished Conduct Medals and two brevet promotions for the officers present . On 22 June 1955 176 Battery was awarded the Honour Title Abu Klea in recognition of its distinguished service in this action . After service in Egypt and the Sudan the battery was stationed again in Malta , then posted to Hong Kong in 1890 , returning to Malta in 1895 and to the United Kingdom 1898 . While in the United Kingdom the battery re-roled as 15 Company , Royal Garrison Artillery and was sent to Ireland until the First World War . There are no records within the battery 's own archives of its activities during the Great War . Afterwards it spent time as Q Coast Battery manning the coastal defences of the United Kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.7 inch Mountain Howitzers and still using mules for transport , the last British battery to do so . At the start of the Second World War , the battery , now renamed 120 Field Battery and part of 32 Regiment , served in France with the British Expeditionary Force and was part of the retreat and evacuation from Dunkirk . Five guns remained under Captain G. R. W. Stainton in a rearguard action to defend the perimeter while the rest of the British force escaped . After returning to the UK , the battery re-equipped with 25 pounders , moved to the Middle East in 1941 and took part in the Anglo-Iraqi War , the SyriaLebanon Campaign , and then later the North African campaign where it participated in Jock columns . During the British retreat to El Alamein , 32 Regiment were tasked to hold Fuka Aerodrome against overwhelming German forces while the RAF evacuated their aircraft . During this engagement , the regiment , including the linked 115/120 Field Battery , suffered massive casualties . The survivors made their way back to Cairo , where 115/120 was reformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montgomery 's successful counteroffensive. 120 Field Battery continued to serve with 25 pounders until the Allied advance reached Tunisia in 1943 . Here the battery was re-equipped with 155mm Long Tom howitzers , became 120 Medium Battery and served in Italy , most notably at Monte Cassino in April 1944 . The battery later played a part in the final battles in northwest Europe in 1945 , and with ironic symmetry was in Dunkirk when the war in Europe ended . It spent some time in the occupation of Germany before returning to the UK . In 1947 120 Field Battery was renamed 176 Field Battery , by which name it is still known today , bar changes in functional designation and the addition of the Honour Title .

In later years it spent some time in Larkhill equipped with 105mm Light Guns , but returned to Germany with nuclear-armed M110 howitzers . During these decades the battery also completed five emergency tours of Northern Ireland in the internal security role . The battery last changed role and equipment in 1990 with the adoption of the Multiple Launch Rocket System ( MLRS ) . The MLRS was hurried into service so that 39 Regiment , now 176 Battery 's parent unit , could deploy on Operation Granby to use it in support of the Coalition Forces during the Gulf War .

2250514 patternla = greenshoulders Edendork St. Malachy 's is a GAA Club based in Edendork , in the town of Dungannon in County Tyrone , Northern Ireland . Their clubhouse was burnt down on 8 November 2008. # History # The history of the G.A.A. in Edendork can be traced back much further than 1932 , the year in which the present St. Malachy 's club was formed . Indeed , it was only three years after the formation of the Gaelic Athletic Association that the game was first played in Edendork . The year was 1887 , and the match was probably the first ever in Tyrone . After a lapse of a few years , Gaelic football was revived at the turn of the century and continued sporadically though fervently for some thirty years at various locations in the district . Then in 1932 the present St. Malachy 's GFC was founded by Larry Fox and immediately joined the East Tyrone Junior League . In 1936 , Edendork won the league for the first tiime and reached the final of the East Tyrone Junior Championship , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made it two league titles in a row , and made it a hit-trick in 1938 , when they also won their first Tyrone title , the Junior Championship . The club won the league again in 1946 , before clinching another three-in-a-row of East Tyrone Junior League titles in 1950 , 1951 and 1952 . Edendork entered senior football for the first time the following season , and also fielded a hurling team . It was back to Junior , however , in 1957 , as emigration robbed the club of many of its leading players , but Edendork immediately made an impact by winning the Tyrone Junior Championship . Edendork returned to senior football with a vengeance in 1958 , just failing to reach the senior championship final in a thrilling semi-final against a Frankie Donnelly-inspired Carrickmore . There was little in the way of success for the next eight years , in fact the club dropped back into Junior football ; but in 1966 the team bounced back to Intermediate football with an unbeaten run to lift the league title . Edendork 's greatest success came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years later the club 's camogie team won the Tyrone league . Two of Edendork 's rising stars , Hugh Mooney and Kieran Currie won All-Ireland minor medals with Tyrone in 1973 , both playing vital roles in an historic victory . In 1976 , the camogie team achieved its greatest triumph by winning the Tyrone Senior Championship . 1982 saw the club 's Golden Jubilee and the publication of a book to mark this milestone , as well a series of celebratory events . Three years later , success returned on the field of play and Edendork lifted their second Intermediate Championship titlem and returned to senior football as double champions , having won the league as well . In the following season , the club 's greatest honour was witnessed all over the world , as two of our members played in the All-Ireland Final against Kerry at Croke Park . The Mallon brothers , Joe and Mickey , were members of the Tyrone team which came so close to bringing the Sam Maguire Cup home .

2269514 Angelica Schuyler Church ( February 20 , 1756 March 13 , 1814 ) was the eldest daughter of Continental Army General Philip Schuyler , wife of British MP John Barker Church , sister of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton ( wife of Alexander Hamilton ) , and a prominent member of the social elite wherever she lived ; first in New York , then in Paris , London and New York again . The village and the town named Angelica , both located in New York State were named after her . # Early life # Angelica Schuyler was born in Albany , New York ; the eldest daughter of Philip Schuyler and Catharine Van Rensselaer Schuyler . Both parents came from wealthy Dutch families prominent since early colonial days . Catharine was a descendant of Kiliaen van Rensselaer , one of the founders of New Netherlands . The Schuylers were also fourth-generation residents . Angelica came of age during the troubled times leading up to the American Revolution , and met many of the prominent revolutionary leaders . Because of her father 's rank and political stature , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and war councils . One of the visitors , in 1776 , was John Barker Church , a British-born merchant who made a fortune during the war supplying the American and French armies . At the time of their meeting and subsequent courtship , Church was on a mission from the Continental Congress to audit army supply records . Knowing that her father would not bless their marriage because of his suspicions about Church 's past , Angelica and John eloped in 1777 . In 1783 , they and their four children left for Europe , not to return to New York until 1797. # Life in Europe # From 1783-85 , Angelica and her family lived in Paris while John performed his duties as a U.S. envoy to the French government . Angelica never failed to enchant the famous , intelligent men she met , and in Paris she soon befriended the venerable Benjamin Franklin , U.S. Ambassador to France . She also developed lasting friendships with Franklin 's successor , Thomas Jefferson , and with the Marquis de Lafayette . After a brief visit to New York in 1785 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London . Now the wife of a very wealthy man , Angelica entered a fashionable social circle that included the Prince of Wales , Whig party leader Charles James Fox and playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan . She also befriended and sponsored emigre American painter John Trumbull , who went on to create some of the most famous paintings of the Revolutionary War era . Always an American at heart , Angelica made a visit in 1789 to attend the inauguration of George Washington as the nation 's first president . # Return to America # John and Angelica Church finally returned to the U.S. in 1797 , to be reunited with her family in New York . In lieu of capital , the young country repaid loan from John Barker Church for funding the revolution army with 100,000 acres of land in Western New York . To take possession of the land , his son Philip traveled to the area of what is today Allegany and Genesee counties , near the Pennsylvania border . Philip Church selected the specific acreage , along the Genesee River , with his surveyor Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plots and design to be reminisent of Paris , France ( a circular drive in the center , streets coming to that drive to form a star , and five churches situated around that circle ) . In the center of the circular drive is the village park . Philip named his planned village Angelica , after his mother . Philip left to marry Anna Matilda Stewart , daughter of General Walter Stewart ( founder of the Erie Canal and Erie Railroad ) in Philadelphia . For their honeymoon , they traveled to first by boat , then raft as far west as Bath , NY , then on horseback to the banks of the Genesee River . Soon they constructed a small house , soon to be whitewashed and known as the white house . Later , they had their mansion built ( known as ' Belvidere ' ) . It still stands on the banks of the Genesee River near Angelica , NY ; it is occupied by its owners .

Angelica 's correspondence with Hamilton , now preserved in the Library of Congress , demonstrates a strong affection between them . There has long been speculation that she may have had a romantic and possibly sexual relationship with Hamilton . Hamilton biographer Ron Chernow notes that : One letter sent to Angelica 's sister Elizabeth , Hamilton 's wife , is suggestive of a relationship , but likely an innocent joke between sisters .

2286514 ' ' This article has been written in 2007/08 with only minor updates since . Please feel free to update it , if need be . ' ' Water supply and sanitation in Jamaica is characterized by high levels of access to an improved water source , while access to adequate sanitation stands at only 80% . This situation affects especially the poor , including the urban poor many of which live in the country 's over 595 unplanned squatter settlements in unhealthy and unsanitary environments with a high risk of waterborne disease . Despite a number of policy papers that were mainly focused on water supply and despite various projects funded by external donors , increases in access have remained limited ( 1% for water and 5% for sanitation between 1990 and 2004 ) . The responsibility for water and sanitation policies within the government rests with the Ministry of Water and Housing , and the main service provider is the National Water Commission . An autonomous regulatory agency , the Office of Utilities Regulation , approves tariffs and establishes targets for efficiency increases . # Access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHO/UNICEF ( /2006 ) . Data for and based on the Survey of Living Conditions ( 2002 ) . In urban areas , where 52% of Jamaicas population lives , access to improved water supply is 98% access to improved sanitation is 91% . Only 31% of the urban population is connected to sewers . In rural areas access stands at 88% for improved water supply and 69% for improved sanitation . Overall , access to improved water supply in Jamaica stands at 93% and access to improved sanitation is currently at 80% . Between 1990 and 2004 access only increased slightly by 1% for water by 5% for sanitation. # Service quality # Many homes receive water only at low pressure . Many rural communities receive water that is not or only irregularly chlorinated . According to the 2011 Population and Housing Census , 69 percent of Jamaica 's households receive untreated drinking water . The following table summarizes the results of the water tested from the 11 major surface sources and 6 wells of the National Water Commission ( NWC ) as compared to the standards set by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' : Office of Utilities Regulation Annual Report 2005-2006 , p. 48 Most of the country 's over 595 unplanned squatter settlements or approximately 10% of the population is located nearby unhealthy and unsanitary environments without piped water or sanitation where there is a high risk of waterborne diseases . The vulnerability to natural disasters threatens the existing water and sanitation systems . Furthermore , there is a heightened probability of contamination of systems following hurricanes due to service interruption as well as the incidence of health-related diseases . # Infrastructure # The National Water Commission ( NWC ) , which produces more than 90% of Jamaica 's total potable water supply , operates a network of more than 160 wells , over 116 river sources ( via water treatment plants ) and 147 springs . The various Parish Councils and a small number of private water companies supply the rest of the potable water . The NWC operates more than 1,000 water supply and over 100 sewerage facilities islandwide . These vary from large raw water storage reservoirs at Hermitage and Mona in St. Andrew and the Great River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small diesel-driven pumping installations serving rural towns and villages across Jamaica . The NWC facilities also include over 4,000 kilometres of pipelines and more than 500 kilometres of sewer mains across the island . NWC supplies some 190 million gallons of potable water each day . # Responsibility for water supply and sanitation # # Policy and regulation # Policy institutions The Ministry of Water and Housing ( MWH ) is responsible for setting water and sanitation policies . It is also in charge of ensuring that all housing developments meet required standards for sanitation . The Ministry of Health develops and implements health policies and legislation to promote appropriate sanitation practices ; establishes and monitors health indicators for sanitation , enforces public health laws , provides public education on sanitation and hygiene . The National Environment and Planning Agency ( NEPA ) determines and monitors environmental standards for water supply and sanitation . Local Authorities have only a limited role in the sector .

The WRA maintains a hydrological database and provides data , information , and technical assistance to government and non-government institutions . Policies Some of the existing policies related to water supply and sanitation are : * The Water Sector Policy Paper ( 1999 ) outlines the current situation and problems within the water sector , defines the objectives of the Government to address the issues , and sets out the mode of implementation . * The National Solid Waste Management Policy ( 2000 ) establishes the framework for standard setting and regulatory agency , the National Solid Waste Management Authority which facilitates the private sector as the principal service provider . The policy also indicates cost recovery provision as key , establishments of sanitary landfills , and solid waste management . * The draft National sanitation policy for Jamaica of 2005 notes that there are overlapping responsibilities at the national and local levels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Community-based organizations , community members , as well as the government . * The Water Sector Policy , Strategy and Action Plan ( 2004 ) has as its main objective to ensure that all households have access to water by 2010 , sewer all major towns by 2020 , as well as rehabilitate existing non-compliant facilities to achieve compliance with national environmental standards . * The Rural Water Supply Master Plan , announced in 2008 , is currently under elaboration . Regulation The Office of Utilities Regulation ( OUR ) , established by an Act of Parliament in 1995 , regulates , among others , water and sanitation service provision . The Office approves tariffs , sets targets for efficiency improvements , processes all license applications for utility services and makes recommendations to the Minister . # Service provision # Water service on the island is provided by one large public entity and three small private companies : * The National Water Commission ( NWC ) is the main institution responsible for all major water and sewerage operations , including : production of water and collection , treatment and disposal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NWC and the Parish Councils . * The smaller private service providers are : Four Rivers Development , Runaway Bay Water Co. , Rio Bueno Water Co , among others . The three provide 10-year non-exclusive licenses . Sanitation services are provided by NWC , Can Cara Development Company and Rosehall Utilities Company . # Other # The Jamaica Social Investment Fund finances community-based water and sanitation projects . # Economic efficiency # The water and sanitation infrastructure is inadequate and inefficiently operated , as the level of Non-revenue water for the NWC was 66% in 2005 . In 2004 , service providers produced 277 million cubic meters of water , but only 103 million cubic meters were consumed . # Financial aspects # # Tariffs and cost recovery # Cost recovery Despite a tariff increase granted to NWC in 2004 , the utility continued to register an operating loss for the fourth consecutive year . There thus is no cost recovery for capital costs . Poor enforcement of tariff payments contributes to the utility 's low revenues .

This is approximately half of what the average household spend on electricity , and a bit less than half of what the average household spends on telephone services . The poorest 20% of household in Jamaica spend 3.2% of their income on water , while the richest 20% send 1.8% of their income on water . # Investment and Financing # Most financing is provided through government grants to NWC , which are in turn financed by external loans , internal debt or general tax revenue . The government intends to tap other sources of financing , such as property taxes ( called millage ) and private sector financing . The Water Sector Policy Paper of 1999 estimated investment needs until 2015 at US$2.2 billion , including US$1.3 billion for the non-agricultural sector , US$0.3 billion for the agricultural sector and US$0.6 billion for sewerage systems . # External cooperation # The main external cooperation partners that provide support to the Jamaican government for water supply and sanitation are the Inter-American Development Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Inter-American Development Bank # * Kingston Metro Water Supply Rehabilitation Approved on June 23 , 2004 , a US$40 million loan aims to improve water and sanitation as well as to modernize the management in Kingston , Jamaica .

At the height of his career he briefly played for the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League . # Career # MacMillan began his career in 1996 , icing for the junior team the Oshawa Generals in the OHL . MacMillan stayed with the Generals for three years , making almost 170 appearances in that time . His solid defensive play combined with a reasonable offensive output for a defenceman meant that in the 1999 NHL entry draft , MacMillan was drafted in the seventh round by the Dallas Stars . MacMillan was sent to play for the Fort Wayne Komets in the UHL , where he played just seven games before being moved to the Michigan K-Wings , a Dallas Stars affiliate team playing in the IHL . In the K-Wings ' last season as a Stars affiliate , MacMillan featured in 53 games .

MacMillan was a cornerstone of the Grizzlies team , and featured in over 300 games during his stay there . MacMillan 's hard work and natural defensive qualities meant that during the 2003/04 season he also featured for the Dallas Stars themselves , and played four regular season NHL games . The following season , MacMillan was again relegated back down to the AHL , this time playing for the Hartford Wolf Pack . In his one season playing for Hartford he was again a key player , playing 71 times and clocking up 136 penalty minutes . MacMillan would play one more season in the AHL in 2005/06 , for the Syracuse Crunch . For the 2006/07 season , MacMillan decided to play in Europe and signed for the Vienna Capitals in the Austrian national league , but did not stay for the whole season , signing for the Phoenix RoadRunners of the ECHL back in North America , where he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play in Europe the following year , and in the summer of 2007 , along with Capital team-mate Scott Fankhouser , agreed to sign for the Manchester Phoenix , a team playing in the EIHL , the top tier of British club ice hockey , where he was also appointed alternate captain by player/coach Tony Hand . MacMillan proved to be a solid , physical defender for the Phoenix but struggled to find form , suffering a number of injuries through the season . The Manchester defence was notably unreliable during the 2007/08 season and at the end of the season , head coach Hand made the decision to re-model the entire defence , releasing MacMillan . MacMillan and Fankhouser would again choose to sign for the same club , agreeing to play for the Bloomington Prairie Thunder of the United Hockey League , an announcement made in July 2008 .

2763514 The Huta Pieniacka massacre was a massacre of the Polish inhabitants of the village Huta Pieniacka , located in modern-day Ukraine , which took place on February 28 , 1944 . Estimates of the number of victims range from 500 to 1,200 . Polish and Ukrainian historians disagree over the responsibility for the Huta Pienacka massacre . According to the Polish Institute of National Remembrance , the action was committed by the 14th subunit of the ' 1st Ukrainian ' Grenadier Division of the Waffen-SS . Polish witnesses testified that the orders were given by German officers . According to Ukrainian sources , it was committed by the German police battalions . According to witness accounts and scholarly publications , SS Galizien were accompanied by Ukrainian nationalists ( a paramilitary unit under Wodzimierz Czerniawski 's command ) , including members of the UPA and inhabitants of local villages who intended to seize property found in the households of the murdered . The Warsaw division of the Commission for the punishment of crimes against the Polish people launched an investigation in July 2001 . The judicial case adheres to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were perpetrated by ethnically Ukrainian citizens of Poland , residents of Eastern Galicia , which up until 1939 formally fell under Polish jurisdiction . # Background # Huta Pieniacka was a village of about 1,000 ethnically Polish inhabitants in 200 houses , located in the Tarnopol Voivodeship , Poland ( today Ternopil oblast in Ukraine ) . In 1939 , following joint German and Soviet attack on Poland , the voivodeship was annexed by the Soviet Union , becoming part of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic . After the 1941 German attack on the Soviet Union , it fell under German occupation . The village was a major Polish resistance centre , fighting against German forces and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army . As a result , the Ukrainians wanted to eliminate this Polish stronghold . Polish inhabitants of the village co-operated with Soviet partisans , active in the area . In January and February 1944 , Soviet troops were frequent visitors , and this was noticed by both the Ukrainians and the Germans . An armed stronghold , Huta Pieniacka had fought off several attacks in 1943 and early 1944. # Prelude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 60 men of the II Battalion of the 4th Gal .

Helion and Company . Chapter 5 . The Poles , many of whom were members of the Home Army , killed two of the troops and wounded another . This incident was described in the ' ' Chronicle of the Halchyna Division ' ' , and documents found in uniforms of the killed soldiers stated that they were members of the SS Galizien Division , stationed in Brody . According to Ukrainian accounts , the bodies of the two soldiers , Roman Andriychuk and Oleksa Bobak , were found naked and mutilated . Their bodies were recovered during a second raid five days later that resulted in between 8-12 Ukrainians being wounded , one of whom , Yuri Hanusiak , died in hospital . Elaborate funerals were organized for those killed , during which Otto Wchter , the German governor of Galicia , laid a wreath at their graves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Events # Early in the morning of February 28 , 1944 , a mixed force of Ukrainian SS and German soldiers surrounded Huta Pieniacka . There were some 600800 soldiers and it has been established that Kazimierz Wojciechowski ( who was burnt alive that day ) , commandant of Polish forces in the village , had been informed of the approaching enemy around two hours before the attack . The Poles however , had too little time to prepare a defense or to escape . The village was shelled by artillery . The Ukrainian SS soldiers , led by a German SS captain , after firing and throwing grenades , entered Huta Pieniacka , assembled the farmers and their families and locked them in their barns . They then set fire to the village and remained until nightfall before leaving . Those trying to escape were killed . # Polish account # Some time around noon a mixed force of Ukrainian SS and German soldiers and a strong contingent from the SS Freiwilligen Division Galizien surrounded Huta Pieniacka and herded the villagers into their barns . The attackers set fire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bogusawa Marcinkowska , a historian from Krakw 's office of the Institute of National Remembrance , the Ukrainians threw infants against walls and cut open the stomachs of pregnant women . The murderers left at night . Many of them were drunk and singing songs . Only four houses remained , and on the next day a mass funeral took place . Those who survived escaped to Zloczow and other towns , never to return . Witnesses interrogated by the Polish prosecutors of the The Head Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation described the details of crimes committed against women , children and newborn babies . After murdering the inhabitants of Huta Pieniacka , the local Ukrainian population looted the remaining property of the murdered , loading everything on horse-drawn carts that had been prepared beforehand . According to those Poles who survived , the Germans did not participate in the massacre itself . In the April 9 , 2008 issue of the ' ' Gazeta Polska ' ' weekly , an article about the massacre appeared . According to those persons who survived ( four of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SS Galizien Division . All those who recollected the massacre ( Emilia Bernacka , then 10 ; Filomena Franczukowska , then 20 ; Jozefa Orlowska , then 16 ; and Regina Wroblewska , then 6 ) claimed that the village was attacked by the Ukrainian troops , who murdered all Poles they managed to catch , including infants . The mentioned persons survived because somebody managed to open the rear door of a village church in which the murderers were massacring the Polish civilians . Filomena Franczukowska , who was 20 then and is the oldest still-living survivor of the massacre ( as of April 2008 ) stated in the ' ' Gazeta Polska ' ' article that the Ukrainians came to the village at 4 am . They entered Huta Pieniacka from the nearby village of Zarkow and began shooting at everybody . Her father had been beaten before being executed , and one of the attackers said loudly in Ukrainian : Now you have your Poland and your England . Franczukowska lost both parents and three younger siblings in the massacre ; only her brother survived . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , aged 4 , and were laughing at the children who were trying to ' wake up ' their dead mother . Franczukowska , together with her brother and a group of people , was ordered to go to a barn which was locked and set on fire . She somehow managed to open the rear door and escape to a forest . Now they say they do not know who did it , but it is enough to visit neighboring Ukrainian villages , one can still see remnants of the stolen property . The locals remember this event and this is why none of them has settled in Huta Pieniacka since then , she said . The weekly publication of the Polish Home Army the ' ' Biuletyn Ziemi Czerwienskiej ' ' ( ' ' Land of Czerwien Bulletin ' ' ) for March 26 , 1944 ( 12 ) 216 , p. 8 stated that during the Battle at Pidkamin and Brody , Soviet forces took a couple of hundred soldiers of the SS Galizien division prisoner . All were immediately shot in the Zbarazh castle on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the killing of the Polish inhabitants of Huta Pienacka , and as a result could not be categorized as prisoners of war . # Ukrainian account # The actions at Huta Pienacka were researched by Ukrainian historian Vasyl Veryha . On the basis of Polish , German and Soviet documents he was able to show that Huta Pienacka was one of the main centres for the Polish Home Army ( Armija Krajowa ) and Soviet partisan activities . The self-defense group of the village cooperated with the Communist ' ' People 's Guard ' ' ; the 9th Soviet partisan detachment named after Chkalov and the special group of Boris Krutikov were based in the village . According to Veryha , the village population ( with women and children ) at that time numbered approximately 500 persons , and the partisans made up another 500 . According to Ukrainian accounts , in addition to attacking German supply columns , the partisans based in Huta Pienicka terrorized neighboring Ukrainian villages , raiding them . Furthermore , according to Ukrainian accounts many of the fires in the village were set by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred as a result of ammunition stored in the houses . The grisly reports by alleged eyewitnesses about the deaths were described as difficult to believe by the Institute of History of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences . According to the chief of staff of the Galizien Division Sturmbannfhrer , Wolf Heike , the local police command demanded that the Galizien Division take part in the operation , requesting a regiment . However because the division was still in the state of formation , the commander-in-chief Fritz Freitag refused to send a regiment . Only after the order was repeated one company and some small detachments were sent . These were attached to the group commanded by Colonel Bayersdorf . Heike wrote that the untrained soldiers with inexperienced commanders were not suited to this task and that the group from the division , as a non-German section , was blamed for things that the Germans had done themselves . They ( the division ) in the final result could not take the responsibility for the pacification of the village . At that time a different German section was functioning . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article appeared directed to the Ukrainian youth written by the military commanders . They blamed all the murders of Poles and Ukrainians on Soviet partisans and stated that God forbid if among those who committed such inhuman acts , a Ukrainian hand was found , it will be forever excluded from the Ukrainian national community . # Russian account # The Russian historical work regarding the massacre differs from those of the Ukrainians and the Poles . Russian historian Sergei Chuyev states that the village was indeed an outpost for Polish and Soviet partisans . The head of the village self-defense was lieutenant Kazimierz Wojciechowski who worked closely with the AK and the Soviet partisans led by Boris Krutikov and Dmitri Medvedyev . On arriving at the village , intense shooting commenced . The battle continued for some time before the village was taken . Chuyev states that Ukrainian police took part in the punitive action , and that one could assume that members of this police force included previous members of the UPA . According to Heike , the group ( sent from the SS Galizien ) did not fulfill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the general from Przemyl who had no idea how to command army divisions . After four weeks of fighting around the area , the group was returned to the division in Neuhammer . Chuyev records that SS Oberfhrer Freitag stated that he would never allow the use of a battle group for such a command , as it became understandable what methods were used by local police commanders covering themselves in the name of the Reichsfhrer-SS , as no direct order had been given by Heinrich Himmler to send a detachment from the Division . # Investigation # The Warsaw branch of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance ( IPN ) started an investigation into the massacre in November 1992 . The investigation was subsequently suspended between 1997 and 2001 , and as of 2008 is being conducted by the Krakw branch of the Institute . The Institute of History of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences investigated the events at Huta Pienicka and concluded that the 4th and 5th SS Police regiments did indeed kill the civilians within the village . It noted that at the time of the massacre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather under German police command ( specifically , under German Sicherheitsdienst and SS command of the General Government ) . During this time , these units enjoyed a close relationship with local UPA units . # Aftermath # After the massacre , some local AK commanders forbade Polish strongholds from sheltering Soviet partisans in order to minimize the risk of those self-defence posts ' destruction . pp.282-285 In the late 1940s , some 8,000 soldiers of the SS Galizien division were allowed to come to Britain , allegedly including members of the unit that massacred inhabitants of Huta Pieniacka . Most of them were not questioned about their activities , and successive British governments refused requests by lobby groups as well as American authorities to investigate their backgrounds . However , a 2001 television documentary , ' ' The SS in Britain ' ' , initiated a police investigation after uncovering evidence suggesting that former members of the SS Galizien division living in Britain had participated in massacres in Poland . The documentary , however , made numerous factual mistakes . The statement that the 4th and 5th regiments of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the Division had at that time been normalized to 3 regiments ; there were no 4th or 5th regiments . The division also was at that time still in the process of formation , which was completed two months later in May 1944 near the Polish town of Dbica. # Recent events # On February 28 , 1989 a memorial was built on the site of the previous village , but was soon destroyed . A new monument commemorating the victims was erected in 2005 and unveiled on October 21 , 2005 . During the unveiling the consul put the blame of the massacre on the Ukrainians in his speech , stating , On 28 February 1944 , when the ' SS Galizien ' together with other Ukrainian nationalists did horrible things as told by a contemporary , they shot mothers , children and murdered .. Ukraine sent a note of protest regarding the fact that the Polish consul had ignored the Ukrainian government completely when opening the monument , that the new monument did not adhere to Ukrainian laws and was erected without the necessary permits . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note of protest regarding the illegal erection of the monument was sent out and the Polish consul was declared a ' ' persona non-grata ' ' for degrading the national dignity of the Ukrainian people . On February 28 , 2007 a new monument was unveiled to the Poles who had been killed in the atrocities at Huta Peniacka . A delegation from Poland led by the vice consul of Culture for the Polish consulate in Lviv , Marcin Zieniewicz , stated that the occasion marked one of the most tragic pages in the history of not only the Polish people , but also of the Ukrainian people . On February 28 , 2009 the presidents of Ukraine and Poland met at the monument to commemorate the massacre . The village of Huta Pieniacka no longer exists . Most of the houses were burned during the massacre and only the school and a Roman Catholic church remained . Both of these buildings were demolished after the war , and in the area of the village there is a pasture for cattle .

Gillespie became known for meticulously painted figurative paintings , landscapes , and self portraits , often with a fantastical element . Many of his early works were made by painting over photographs cut from newspapers or magazines , transforming the scenes through photographic collage and by adding imaginary elements . In his later work he abandoned his early fascination with creating hyper-realized realistic imagery , instead focusing on a looser and more expressive style . He often combined media in an unorthodox way to create shrine-like assemblages .

2881514 area rank= 171= Population= 0 Hermetray ( ) is an uninhabited island off North Uist , in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland . # Geography and geology # Hermetray lies in the Sound of Harris on the edge of the Minch . It is on the south side of the sound although it is in the parish of Harris . The island is 72ha sqmi in area , and 35m ft at its highest point , ' ' Cnoc a ' Chombaiste ' ' ( compass hill ) . The bedrock of the island is Lewisian gneiss . The hillock of ' ' Cnoc a ' Chombaiste ' ' is found to the northeast . The other main geomorphological features are ' ' Acarseid Mr ' ' ( big harbour ) to the west a shallow and weedy inlet with a rocky shore and Loch Hermetray at the island 's centre . There are numerous surrounding islets . The largest is Vaccasay or ' ' Bhacasaigh ' ' ( island with a bay ) which extends to and lies to the west . Along with Fuam to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheltered Basin of Vaccasay . Fuam 's full name in Gaelic is ' ' Fuam an Aon Fhoid ' ' , meaning far out isle of the one peat a reference to its shallow soils . Greineam and the skerries of Staffin and Creag na Stead lie to the north in the Grey Horse Channel and Grodaigh and the once fortified Dun Mhic Leathann to the south , beyond the ' ' Selaid na h-Eala ' ' and close to North Uist . This strait is named after the ' ' Eala Bhn ' ' ( white swan ) , a famous 17th century ' ' birlinn ' ' . ' ' Selaid ' ' means a sailing channel , fairway in the sea or anchorage . Further northwest is the Cabbage Patch , a complex group of reefs and skerries including the islets of Opasaigh , Srstaigh and Nrstaigh. # History # The island 's name is Norse , ' ' Hermunr-y ' ' meaning Hermund 's Island , although it is not known who this person was . The Ordnance Survey also refer to the islet by its Gaelic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hermodray that it was a : ' ' half mile lang , fertile and frutfull ' ' . Martin Martin visited the island in 1695 and said of it , that it had : ' ' moorish soil , covered all over almost in heath , except here and there , with a few piles of grass and the plant milkwort . Yet not withstanding this disadvantage , it is certainly the best spot of its extent for pasturage amongst these isles , and affords plenty of milk in January and February beyond what can be seen in other islands . ' ' Martin Martin also mentions that there is : : ' ' the foundation of a house built by the English in the reign of King Charles the First 's time , for one of their magazines to lay up the cask , salt etc , for carrying on the fishery , which was then begun in the Western Islands ; but this design miscarried because of the civil wars which then broke out . ' ' Martin was referring to Lord Seaforth 's fishery , set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . It was part of Charles I 's Company of the General Fishery of Great Britain &amp; Ireland . In 1841 , a population of 8 was recorded as living on the island in a single household . Ordnance Survey maps published in 1881 showed six unroofed buildings on the island , which has remained uninhabited since the mid 19th century . A sheep fank at Acarseid Mr may be on the site of the 1841 house . North Uist was much affected by the Highland Clearances from where there was large scale emigration to Cape Breton in Canada but no certain reasons for the abandonment of Hermetray have come to light . In 1921 , a Norwegian ship , the ' ' Puritan ' ' was wrecked here . Reportedly the three survivors would not partake of a crate of whisky which was wrecked with them , and did not thank their rescuer , Alasdair Beag of Berneray , when he arranged for them to be returned to their home country . The Hebrideans explained this by the name of the ship , although it should be pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heremtray is currently owned by the Scottish Government and there is a fish farm in the Basin of Vaccasay. # Wildlife # Gulls and buzzards nest in the low cliffs and escaped American mink have been trapped on the island during an eradication programme . Fish are absent from Loch Hermetray . The flora includes adder 's tongue , flag iris , bog cotton , ragged robin and white clover . # In popular culture # In the ' ' Harry Potter ' ' universe , at some point in the 16th Century Zygmunt Budge , an accomplished maker of potions , took up residence on Hermetray after leaving Hogwarts in protest at the age of 14 . Living alone , he continued his studies and eventually wrote the ' ' Book of Potions ' ' . # Notes #

2922514 Hughes/ Thrall was musical project formed in 1982 by former Deep Purple and Trapeze bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes and guitarist journeyman Pat Thrall . # History # While Pat Thrall had spent the late 1970s and early 1980s making a name for himself by playing with the likes of Automatic Man and Pat Travers , former Deep Purple man Glenn Hughes recorded one solo album after the demise of Purple in 1976 entitled ' ' Play Me Out ' ' ; a record that focused more on his love of soul and funk rather than hard-rock . ' ' Play Me Out ' ' had limited success and Hughes had slipped off the musical map , save for a few guest appearances here and there . Hughes moved to Los Angeles to write with the intention of releasing new material . In 1981 , Thrall 's playing caught Hughes ' eye and the two formed a musical partnership . After a period of jamming and writing they started recording with producer Andy Johns ( who had previously worked with the likes of Led Zeppelin , Free and The Rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called ' ' Hughes/Thrall ' ' in August 1982 . Released on a short-lived subsidiary of Epic Records The album itself had a definite radio-friendly , album-oriented rock sound . However it also had elements of post-punk and New wave music Hughes/Thrall took to the road for a short American tour , playing a handful of gigs in California and Texas supporting Santana . The touring band featured drummer Tommy Aldridge and keyboardist Jesse Harms. # Further collaborations # The pair recorded some demos for a proposed follow-up to the first album , but these never ended up being released and the album was scrapped . A few of these demos have surfaced over the years , but are of limited quality . One of the songs originally intended for the aborted follow-up to ' ' Hughes/Thrall ' ' , Still the Night later appeared on the 1985 ' ' Phenomena ' ' album , which featured Hughes vocals . This song also made an appearance on John Norums 1992 album ' ' Face the Truth ' ' , again featuring Hughes . Thrall would also record another version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontman Tony Liddle and Billy Rush of Southside Johnny &amp; The Asbury Jukes , though this never progressed beyond demo form . Hughes and Thrall did team up again in 1987 to record a track for the Tom Hanks-Dan Aykroyd comedy ' ' Dragnet ' ' . The song , City of Crime , featured Hanks and Aykroyd rapping the verses , while Hughes sang the chorus . It was released as a single and a promotional video was shot , which received heavy rotation on MTV . Two songs , You Were Always There and Devil in You , from the abandoned follow-up album were included on Hughes 1994 solo album ' ' From Now On ... ' ' ; although both were new recordings that did not feature Thralls playing . Thrall did , however perform on Hughes 1995 album ' ' Feel ' ' , playing guitar and keyboards on eight of the tracks and co-writing two of them . To date this is the most recent collaboration between Hughes and Thrall . # Hughes/Thrall followup # In 2006 it was announced that Hughes and Thrall were actively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the process of writing and recording new material . In September , they started the final phase of the recording process , and announced that the album would be released in 2007 . The news of the new album coincided with the setting up of hughesthrall.com . The first Hughes/Thrall album was remastered and re-released in January 2007 on Rock Candy Records . This new version included two additional tracks . In 2007 , it was announced on their website that Hughes/Thrall 2 had been pushed back to 2008 . They also stated that the album includes thirteen songs , of which eleven are new compositions , while two date back from the sessions of the scrapped initial follow-up . In June 2009 , Hughes confirmed I have put the Hughes/Thrall 2 project behind me .. We started the album in 1997 and Pat Thrall wanted to produce it by himself . Ten years to produce an album ? I usually take no more than six months .

2984514 The postpaid mobile phone is a mobile phone for which service is provided by a prior arrangement with a mobile network operator . The user in this situation is billed after the fact according to their use of mobile services at the end of each month . Typically , the customer 's contract specifies a limit or allowance of minutes , text messages etc. , and the customer will be billed at a flat rate for any usage equal to or less than that allowance . Any usage above that limit incurs extra charges . Theoretically , a user in this situation has no limit on use of mobile services and , as a consequence , unlimited credit . This service is better for people with a secured income . Postpaid service mobile phone typically requires two essential components in order to make the ' post-usage ' model viable : #Credit history/Contractual commitment : This is the basis on which the service provider is able to trust the customer with paying their bill when its due and to have legal resource in case of non-payment #Service tenure : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-3 year ) contracts committing to use of the service . Failure to complete the term would make the customer liable for early terminiation fees . The bill itself is an important component of the services which acts as an ambassador of the service provider and at times as an evidence of the service itself . The bill needs to be readable , comprehensible as well as aesthetically attractive for the subscriber to be interested enough to see details other than the bill amount . The United States is an example of a country dominated by postpaid providers including Verizon , AT&amp;T , Sprint , and T-Mobile , although a smaller market has been captured by prepaid providers such as Boost Mobile , Virgin Mobile , MetroPCS , Cricket Wireless and TracFone , many of which use postpaid providers networks ( e.g. MetroPCS is carried on the T-Mobile network ) . The alternative billing method is a prepaid mobile phone where a user pays in advance for credit which is then consumed by use of the mobile phone service . 
2990514 The Brigantine Lighthouse is a lighthouse in Brigantine , New Jersey , USA . It was built in 1926 by the Island Development Real Estate Company to attract people to Brigantine Beach Island and not as an operating lighthouse . Over the years , it has served as the headquarters for the Brigantine Police Department , as a museum and a gift shop . The lighthouse fell into disrepair in the early 1990s , so a group of volunteers refurbished the building in 1995 . Today , the Brigantine Lighthouse is one of Brigantine 's most noticeable features . 
3033514 Porthoustock is a hamlet near St Keverne in Cornwall , England , United Kingdom , on the east coast of Lizard Peninsula . Aggregates are quarried nearby and Porthoustock beach is dominated by a large concrete stone mill . The mill was once used to crush stone but is now disused . Coastal trading ships of up to 82 m can dock alongside the wharf along the southern edge of the beach to be loaded with stone . Fishing boats operate from the shingle beach , with lobster and crab potting , net fishing and long lining as the principal fishing methods . The South West Coast Path passes through Porthoustock . Porthoustock lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty ( AONB ) . Almost a third of Cornwall has AONB designation , with the same status and protection as a National Park . # History # Porthoustock originated as a fishing hamlet . However , from the 1890s the village developed as a port for the local stone quarries . There has been quarrying activity in Porthoustock since the late 19th century . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone to build Cornwall 's wartime airfields . Porthoustock survived a German bombing raid in November 1940 with no casualties . Porthoustock 's proximity to The Manacles , a set of treacherous rocks which extend about 1nmi km east and south east of Manacle Point means that it has been the location for numerous shipwrecks . The Royal National Lifeboat Institution ( RNLI ) stationed a lifeboat at Porthoustock in 1869 and built a boat house by the beach . The station was closed in 1942 and has since become the village hall . The last boat stationed here was the ' ' Kate Walker ' ' which arrived in 1931 . After it was sold in 1946 it was converted to a yacht and was reported as being at Felixstowe Ferry in 2007. # Geology # Analcime , analcite , epidote , hornblende , prehnite , calcite , diorite and pectolite are all minerals extracted from the quarries in Porthoustock . A natural rock formation known as the Giant 's Quoits stands on the cliffs above Porthoustock . The rocks once stood on Manacle Point but were moved to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarries . The cliffs and quarries to the south of the hamlet are designated as part of ' ' Coverack to Porthoustock SSSI ' ' ( Site of Special Scientific Interest ) for their geological interest . # Economy # Aram Resources ' West of England Quarry is situated adjacent to Porthoustock village . The quarry works a dark green diorite rock mass and has its own wharf allowing the loading of aggregates directly from the quarry to ships . The wharf is protected from the prevailing southwesterly Atlantic weather systems , ensuring minimal disruption to ship loading . # Diving # Porthoustock is a popular launching beach for divers en route to The Manacles and instruction in diving is available . # Notable residents # Titanic survivor Mrs Annie Margaret Hold was born in Porthoustock .

3041514 Neocatastrophism is the hypothesis that life-exterminating events such as gamma-ray bursts have acted as a galactic regulation mechanism in the Milky Way upon the emergence of complex life in its habitable zone . It is proposed as an explanation of Fermi 's paradox since it provides a mechanism which would have delayed the otherwise expected advent of intelligent beings in the local galaxy nearby to Earth . This is an avenue to explain why none so far have been detected by humans . # The problem # It is estimated that Earth-like planets in the Milky Way started forming 9 Gya BP , and that their median age is 6.4 0.7 Gya . Moreover , 75% of stars in the galactic habitable zone are older than the Sun . This makes the existence of potential planets with evolved intelligent life more likely than not to be older than that of the Earth ( 4.54 Gya ) . This creates an observational dilemma since interstellar travel , ( even of the slow kind that is nearly within the reach of present Earth technology ) could in theory , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy . This leads to a conundrum first posed in 1950 by the physicist Enrico Fermi in his namesake paradox : Why are no aliens or their artifacts physically here ? # The neocatastrophism resolution # Astrobiological evolution is subject to regulation mechanisms that arrest or postpone the advent of complex creatures capable of interstellar communication and traveling technology . These regulation mechanisms act to temporarily sterilize planets of biology in the galactic habitable zone . The main proposed regulation mechanism is gamma-ray bursts . Part of the neocatastrophism hypothesis is that stellar evolution produces a decreasing frequency of such catastrophic events increasing the length of the window in which intelligent life might arise as galaxies age . According to modeling , this creates the possibility of a phase shift at which point a galaxy turns from a place that is essentially dead ( with a few pockets of simple life ) to one that is crowded with complex life forms .

Comozon began his career as an ordinary army recruit under the Emperor Commodus , whom he served as a soldier in the province of Thrace . While there he suffered a demotion from the provincial government under Tiberius Claudius Attalus Paterculianus . However , this incident did not hinder his later promotion and he want on to make a military career . In the year 218 he commanded a legion Legio II Parthica prefect , who was then temporarily stationed in Apamea in Syria.Upon the accession of Macrinus as emperor in 217 , Comazon orchestrated a revolt among the Third Legion to help secure the throne for Elagabalus , who was tied to the Severan dynasty .

3089514 The House of Gurieli ( ) was a Georgian royal noble family and a ruling dynasty ( dukes ) of the southwestern Georgian province of Guria which was autonomous and later for a few centuries independent , as well as a few ducal rulers of the dynasty rose in the 17th-18th centuries to be kings of the whole western Caucasus in place of hereditary Bagrationi kings of Imereti . Initially a hereditary title of governors ( Eristavi ) of Guria since the mid-13th century , Gurieli ( literally , of Guria ) was adopted as a dynastic name by the Vardanisdze family ( ) , hereditary rulers of Svaneti ( a highland province in western Georgia ) . The other notable branch of the Vardanisdze was the Dadiani ( ) of Samegrelo . Both of these branches occasionally used double names : Gurieli-Dadiani or Dadiani-Gurieli . The medieval Gurieli were vassals to the Georgian crown , but , at the same time , seem to have paid some kind of homage ( ) to the rulers of the neighboring Empire of Trebizond , whose last emperor , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documented as having been ' gambros ' of Mamia Vardanisdze-Gurieli ( c. 1450 - 69 ) , which is interpreted that Mamia married his daughter or sister or close kinswoman . If the couple had issue , possibly the subsequent ruler Kakhaber ( 146983 ) , the latter-day Gurieli should have descended from several Byzantine and Trapezuntine emperors . In the 1460s , when the power of the Bagrationi Dynasty of Georgia was on the decline , the Gurieli pursued a policy of separation and became virtually ( and even formally acknowledged in occasions ) independent rulers ( mtavari ) of the Principality of Guria in the mid-16th century , but were forced to pay tribute to the Ottoman Empire , nominally recognizing also the authority of the princes of Mingrelia and kings of Imereti . Throughout the following two centuries , the politics of the Gurieli dynasty were dominated by the conflicts with the neighboring Georgian rulers , Ottoman inroads , and repeated occasions of civil strife and palace coups . In the 17th and 18th centuries , as many as four Gurieli rulers managed to get chosen kings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Imereti . Gurieli kings ( ephemeral as some of their royal reigns were ) however are usually characterized as usurpers , or as rival dynasty of counter-monarchs . Powerful neighbors also in several occasions managed to change the rulership of Guria itself to other members of the Gurieli dynasty , there were rivalling branches of the family itself .

3177514 Peyton M. Magruder ( October 19 , 1911 , Fort Riley , Kansas &amp;ndash ; January 19 , 1982 , Marathon , Florida ) was an aircraft designer best known for his design of the Glenn L. Martin Company 's B-26 Marauder . Magruder was also responsible for the design of the Martin B-10 and the Martin Model 146 ( note , however , both of these attributions seem to be in error because the B-10 's first flight was on February 16 , 1932 when Magruder was only 20 years old and apparently still a midshipman at Annapolis and the Model 146 's first flight was in 1935 - while Magruder did n't join Martin Company until 1937 ) . # Early life # Magruder was born into a military family ; his father was Brigadier General Marshall Magruder . His early life was a succession of moves from one post to another due to his father 's career . This would take him to Manila , Yokohama , Hawaii , and several other posts . Because of his father 's career he had to attend four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Annapolis and West Point . Magruder chose to attend the Naval Academy in Annapolis which he entered in 1930 . He studied less -- and partied more -- than most , but still remained in the upper part of his class . He pole-vaulted for the track team , was a member of the swim team , and once won $350 in bets by running five miles ( 8 km ) in 29 minutes and 37 seconds . He resigned during his senior year of 1934 partially due to a scandal which has now become a part of Naval Academy lore , and partially in order to apply for enlistment in the Army 's aviation school . At that time the Army would not give up slots for Navy officers and cadets because the Navy had its own air school . In order to improve his chances of acceptance Magruder signed up with one of the National Guard 's air units , and enrolled in the Aeronautical Engineering curriculum at the University of Alabama . However , before completion of his one year at Alabama he was engaged to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magruder soon obtained a position at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia , through an encounter with Adm .

Martin Company , now Lockheed-Martin. # Design of the B-26 # Glenn L. Martin assigned the then 27-year-old aeronautical engineer the title of Project Engineer , and the task of designing Model 179 according to Army Air Corps specifications issued in January 1939 . This model would later become known as the B-26 Marauder . Design of the Model 179 was completed in June 1939 . On July 5 , 1939 , the Model 179 was submitted to a review board and was rated the highest of those submitted .

3178514 Sum of absolute transformed differences ( SATD ) is a widely used video quality metric used for block-matching in motion estimation for video compression . It works by taking a frequency transform , usually a Hadamard transform , of the differences between the pixels in the original block and the corresponding pixels in the block being used for comparison . The transform itself is often of a small block rather than the entire macroblock . For example , in x264 , a series of 4&amp;times ; 4 blocks are transformed rather than doing the more processor-intensive 16&amp;times ; 16 transform . # Comparison to other metrics # SATD is slower than the sum of absolute differences ( SAD ) , both due to its increased complexity and the fact that SAD-specific MMX and SSE2 instructions exist , while there are no such instructions for SATD . However , SATD can still be optimized considerably with SIMD instructions on most modern CPUs . The benefit of SATD is that it more accurately predicts quality from both the standpoint of objective and subjective metrics . As such , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive and estimate distortion explicitly , such as in the Theora ( since 1.1 alpha2 ) encoder , as an optional metric used in wide motion searches , such as in the Microsoft VC-1 encoder , or as a metric used in sub-pixel refinement , such as in x264.

3231514 birthplace = Birmingham , England Bernard Patrick Bunny Larkin ( born 11 January 1936 ) is an English former professional footballer who played at inside forward or wing half . He played in the First Division of the Football League and in European competition for Birmingham City , and in the Football League for Norwich City , Doncaster Rovers , Watford and Lincoln City . # Biography # Larkin was born in Digbeth , Birmingham . He joined local club Birmingham City as a 16-year-old wing half , signing professional forms at 18 . He made his debut at inside left in October 1956 , when he was nearly 21 ; the club had a big squad in those days , and it was not unusual for a player to be well into his twenties before getting into the first team on a regular basis . : When I joined the club the staff was bigger than is normal nowadays . We even had pros playing for the fifth team and by the time you reached the ' A ' team there were some very good players indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another six games that season . He played more frequently the following season , filling in at right-half for Johnny Watts . He took part in both legs of the semi-final of the 195558 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup against Barcelona , though he missed the replay . His career changed in November 1958 , when he was selected at inside left in place of the ageing Peter Murphy . Between then and the end of the season he scored 23 goals in all competitions , including four goals in the early rounds of the 195860 Fairs Cup , which made him the club 's top scorer for the 195859 season . He attributed his goalscoring success to being two-footed : : I 'd always scored goals wherever I 'd played . I had the advantage of being able to use both feet to shoot . That meant that you did n't have to change your position when the ball came to you . There do n't seem to be many players around nowadays that can do that . He contributed another goal in the Fairs Cup semi-final , but by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form and left the club , transferred to Norwich City for a fee of 10,000 . An incident in which he overslept and missed the flight to a European away game did not help his cause . He spent two seasons at Norwich , then went on to Doncaster Rovers , Watford , Lincoln City and to non-league clubs including Wisbech Town , Nuneaton Borough , King 's Lynn and Stevenage Athletic . He had the distinction of being the first Lincoln City player ever to be substituted in the Football League . After retiring from football he settled in the Norwich area and became a salesman for a bakery firm . # Honours # *with Birmingham City **Club 's top league scorer 1959

3249514 ' ' Dreaming Out Loud ' ' is the debut album by American rock band OneRepublic . The album was released on November 20 , 2007 by Interscope Records . The album was recorded between 2004 and 2006 and it was produced by Greg Wells , with two songs produced by singer Ryan Tedder , and was engineered and combined by Joe Zook . The album follows two years of massive success on Myspace , where the band has appeared in MySpace Music 's Top Artists since early 2006 , with over 28 million total song plays counted . The album was released after the success of a remix version of the lead single Apologize , which was produced by Timbaland . The song reached number one in many countries , while it peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . The following single Stop and Stare was also a success , while Say ( All I Need ) , Mercy and Come Home were also released as singles . The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics . Many critics cited U2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band 's influences on the album . Some commended the band for having a tremendous confidence apparent in the craft of creating pleasing music , but others felt it was an unoriginal album and thought that Tedder continued to make alternative pop rock fare better whenever he was writing for groups other than his own . Many critics noted that it was difficult to distinguish the differences between some tracks . The album reached top ten in many countries , including the Australian Albums Chart , Canadian Albums Chart , German Albums Chart , UK Albums Chart and others . It debuted at number 14 on the ' ' Billboard ' ' 200 chart . ' ' Dreaming Out Loud ' ' has been certified Platinum by the RIAA. # Background # OneRepublic is an alternative pop rock band formed in Los Angeles in 2003 . The band , which was formed in Colorado by Ryan Tedder and high school classmate Zach Filkins , also includes fellow Coloradan , guitarist/keyboardist Drew Brown , drummer Eddie Fisher , and bass/cellist Brent Kutzle . They worked in the studio for two and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two months before their album was due to be released , ( with Sleep as their debut single ) , they were dropped by Columbia Records . The band was beginning to gain prominence on MySpace , becoming the number-one unsigned act on the site . The song Apologize was already released on MySpace the same year . When a remixed version of Apologize found its way onto Timbaland 's Shock Value in early 2007 , and after the song 's appearance in a number of American TV dramas , allied with two years of MySpace notoriety , OneRepublic were faced with a number one hit , even without an accompanying album . # Composition # Many critics cited U2 , Coldplay , Snow Patrol and The Fray as the band 's influences on the album . The album starts out with Say ( All I Need ) , which according to Blogcritics is a U2-sounding song , that is full of soaring heartfelt vocals . It begins with a vocal effect , and leads to an overlooking verse on a girl 's soul by Ryan Tedder . With chopped-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with rising crescendos and interesting musical textures . Mercy features an upbeat tempo and is full of hope and promise . Stop and Stare is a big , muscular rock ballad , which according to Digital Spy is very much in the Matchbox 20 mould , steered by a vein-poppingly emotional vocal from lead singer Ryan Tedder . Apologize has heart-felt lyrics and is heavy on self-imposed melodrama . It has hip-hop beats mingling with a string section cutting Ryan Tedder 's bland vocals with a stuttering R&amp;B drum loop . Goodbye Apathy has a chorus that was considered charmingly harmonious , while Tedder 's vocals were considered U2-sounding . All Fall Down begins with an acoustic riff followed by strings that follow the riff , while the verses follows the instruments as well . The seventh track Tyrant crank up the rock guitars , letting a little bit of angst bleed through the bands performance . It begins with a fast piano playing . Tedder enters slowly at first , but picks up speed with a drum beat that enters too . In the song , he sings : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na sing . Prodigal is a pure ballad that uses guitar riffs and keyboards to back dreamy vocals . Wont Stop is almost an alternative country in its sound . It is a ballad compared to Turin Brakes classic The Optimist LP , replete with strings , bells , and harmonized vocals . All We Are is a ballad backed by keyboards and reminiscent of The Fray in both sound and style . Someone To Save You was considered a big song , with big vocals and big sound , kind of a ballad on steroids . The sombre piano ballad Come Home offers a political stance on the war and an appeal to bring the troops home . It is a tribute to American soldiers and was written by Tedder about a soldier friend of his who was serving overseas . The last track is a remixed version of Apologize produced and featuring Timbaland . The Timbaland remix has his trademark yeah grunts in the background and a slight resequencing of the drum patterns . # Critical reception # ' ' Dreaming Out Loud ' ' received generally mixed reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album 3 out of 5 stars , and noted that the album still sounded derivative , almost as if it were mimicking the popular trends that Tedder helped create with his production gigs . None of this made ' ' Dreaming Out Loud ' ' a bad album , particularly , but it did make it an unoriginal one , and Tedder continued to fare better whenever he was writing for groups other than his own . Blogcritics wrote a very positive review , stating that ' ' Dreaming Out Loud ' ' is full of hopeful ballads and a couple of rock songs , and reveals OneRepublic 's vocal and musical talents . Evan Sawdey from PopMatters wrote : Though Greg Wells ' high-budget production gives ' ' Dreaming Out Loud ' ' a professional sheen , the problems start and end with Tedder . His band , his voice , his lyricsthey 've all been heard before . What 's particularly disappointing is how his songs all just blend together in a strictly melodic sense . Rob Sheffield from ' ' Rolling Stone ' ' commented : On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a drag , since the half-loud guitars and sob-in-the-throat vocals could be absolutely anybody . Nick Levine from Digital Spy called it a fairly drab , characterless affair . Chris Jones from BBC Music expressed : It remains an album that will appeal to fans of the OC and those moments when the lovelorn antics of the cast demand some cod-existentialism . It may be pop , but it 's a long way from fun . # Singles # The first single to be lifted from the album was Apologize , both in its original form and a version remixed by Timbaland . The remix helped propel the song to number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in late 2007 . Its 25 weeks in the top 10 were the most there since Santana 's Smooth featuring Rob Thomas spent 30 in 1999 . Apologize has also sold more than 3.6 million downloads only in the United States .

A third single from the album , Say ( All I Need ) was released in June 27 , 2008 . The song was n't as successful as the previous singles , only reaching number 51 on the UK Singles Chart and number 75 on the Canadian Hot 100 . In September 2008 , the band released their fourth single , Mercy . The official video for Mercy debuted in the UK on August 15 , 2008 , on the music channel ' Q ' . The video is filmed in black and white and features OneRepublic performing the song on a beach . However , the song did n't chart on the UK Singles Chart . Come Home , a digital single , was remastered featuring Sara Bareilles and was released on July 14 , 2009 in the iTunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hot 100 at #80. # Media appearance # Apologize was used in the film Keinohrhasen ( 2007 ) and on Cold Case .

3315514 Design technology , or D.T. , is the study , design , development , application , implementation , support and management of computer and non-computer based technologies for the express purpose of communicating , using various mediums , product design intent and constructability as well as to facilitate product operation and maintenance and to ultimately improve overall product design realization , construction , operation and maintenance . At times there is cross-over between D.T. and Information Technology , however , whereas I.T . is primarily focused on overall network infrastructure , hardware &amp; software requirements , and implementation , D.T. is specifically focused on supporting , maintaining and training design and engineering applications and tools and working closely with I.T . to provide necessary infrastructure , for the most effective use of these applications and tools . Within the building design , construction and maintenance industry ( also known as AEC/O/FM ) , the product is the building and the role of D.T. , is the effective application of technologies within all phases and aspects of building process . So though D.T. encompasses Building Information Modelling , B.I.M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more overarching in its directive and scope and likewise looks for ways to leverage and more effectively utilize C.A.D. , Virtual Design &amp; Construction , V.D.C. , as well as historical and legacy data and systems .

Though not directly related there are also formal courses of study in some countries known as design and technology that focus on particular areas . In this case the above definition still remains valid , if for instance you take the subject textiles technology and replace product in the above definition with textile .

3440514 Pariguz ( Serbian : ' ' para ' ' - steam , ' ' guz ' ' - ass ) is a lake in Resnik , an urban neighborhood of Belgrade , Serbia . The funny name of the lake was inherited from the muddy valley which existed before . Creeks filled the valley with water , forming mud which , according to locals , had the power to cure hemorrhoids , so a local with a nude ass was no rare sight by the creek . The lake itself is 700 m long and 120 m wide . This artificial lake was made in 1989 , then dried in 1999 , during the NATO bombing of Serbia ( Urban legends tell that one of the bombs fell in the lake , but never exploded and that was the reason drying and cleaning ; this was never confirmed ) . After that period , the bottom of the lake was cleaned and the lake refilled with water from 4 creeks , which form the Topcider river . Today , the lake is rich with fish and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , partridges and other birds . Current plans for making Pariguz part a sport centre with hotels and restaurants on water are dividing the local community , which agrees that some part of the shore should be arranged for the swimmers , but highly disapproves of the disturbance of the local ecosystem , and the peacefulness of its shores , which many locals seek and find in this place . # References # * ' ' The information in this article is based on that in its Serbian equivalent ' ' . 
3454514 Ryszard Bakst ( 4 April 1926&amp;ndash ; 25 March 1999 ) was a Polish pianist and distinguished piano teacher . Bakst was a descendant of the Russian artist Lon Bakst . His teachers were initially his mother and pianist Jzef Turczyski , then Abram Lufer ( who had won 4th Prize at the 1932 Chopin International Piano Competition ) and later Konstantin Igumnov and Heinrich Neuhaus at the Moscow Conservatory , and finally with pianist Zbigniew Drzewiecki . Bakst was a prize winner at the 4th Chopin International Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1949 and performed in Europe and the USA the Far East and numerous other places around the world . He was particularly known for his interpretations of Chopin but also played composers as diverse as Aaron Copland and Juliusz Zarbski . He immigrated to Great Britain in 1968 and did not return to his beloved Poland until 1988 when he was feted in a televised concert at the Warsaw Philharmonic Hall . Among the most gifted students he taught , according to Bakst himself , are Andrew Wilde and Pawel Skrzypek , and , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bakst held in high regard are Alicja Fiderkiewicz , Janusz Olejniczak and Ronan O'Hora , whilst the long list of other students includes the highly successful Paul Lewis as well as Marta Karbownicka , Graham Scott , Mark Anderson , Matthew Schellhorn , Peter Seivewright , Timothy Horton and many others . During lessons he could be so inspired and inspiring , but also had a reputation as a highly disciplined and strict task-master often making enormous demands on the most gifted students . His attention to sound ( Artur Rubinstein was frequently mentioned ) was legendary and any deviations from the text would be immediately picked up . His students were devoted to him and he very rarely took on new students such was the demand for his services . He died after complications from diabetes mellitus and was cremated in North Manchester .

3515514 George Eld ( died 1624 ) was a London printer of the Jacobean era , who produced important works of English Renaissance drama and literature , including key texts by William Shakespeare , Ben Jonson , Christopher Marlowe , and Thomas Middleton . Eld was the son of a carpenter from Derbyshire . He served an eight-year apprenticeship to bookseller Robert Bolton , starting in 1592 , and became a freeman ( a full member ) of the Stationers Company on 13 January 1600 . He established himself in his own printing business in 1604 , at the sign of the White Horse in Fleet Lane , by marrying the widow of not one but two master printers . His shop featured two or perhaps three presses , and four compositors -- a substantial operation for the time . Eld entered into a partnership with Miles Fletcher in 1617 ; Fletcher took over the business once Eld died of plague in 1624. # Printer # In Eld 's historical era , most stationers concentrated on either printing or bookselling ; and most publishing was done by the booksellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eld was primarily a printer during his career , working on specific projects for specific booksellers . In his two-decade career , Eld printed a wide variety of works ; when the printer is identified on title pages only with initials , researchers have used Eld 's characteristic title-page device , two volutes with foliage , for supporting evidence . He is the G. E. who printed William Camden 's ' ' Remains of a Greater Work ' ' ( 1605 ) for Simon Waterson , John Selden 's ' ' The Duello ' ' ( 1610 ) for John Helme , and Peter Gosselin 's ' ' The State Mysteries of the Jesuits ' ' ( 1623 ) for Nicholas Bourne . # Thorpe # Eld worked regularly for Thomas Thorpe ; the two produced more than twenty titles together . These included the first quartos of Jonson 's ' ' Sejanus ' ' ( 1605 ) , ' ' Volpone ' ' ( 1606 ) , and ' ' The Masque of Blackness ' ' and ' ' The Masque of Beauty ' ' ( in one volume , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' What You Will ' ' ( 1607 ) , and George Chapman 's ' ' All Fools ' ' ( 1605 ) and ' ' The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles , Duke of Byron ' ' ( 1608 ) . Thorpe and Eld were also involved in two dubious publishing enterprises -- one , a failed attempt to print a work to which they did not have the rights , and the other , a successful piracy of some work by Thomas Coryat. # Shakespeare # Thorpe and Eld 's most significant project was the 1609 first edition of Shakespeare 's Sonnets . In 1612 , Thorpe and Eld also issued a work of modern Shakespearean controversy , the ' ' Funeral Elegy ' ' that Donald Foster proposed as a work by Shakespeare , without convincing most scholars and critics . More Shakespeare : Eld printed the 1609 quarto of ' ' Troilus and Cressida , ' ' for Richard Bonian and Henry Walley . Some critics have complained that the text in this volume is so poor that it should be classed as a bad quarto ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how much is due to a faulty manuscript source that Eld had to work with , is open to question . ( Eld 's ' ' Sejanus ' ' text , in contrast , is excellently printed . ) Eld has also been identified as the printer of John Smethwick 's third quarto of ' ' Hamlet ' ' ( 1611 in literature ) . # Others # Eld also printed the 1619 second quarto of Marlowe 's ' ' Doctor Faustus ' ' for John Wright . And for William Aspley , he printed one of the most controversial plays of the period , ' ' Eastward Ho ' ' ( three editions , 1605 ) . Eld printed first editions of a range of other texts in Jacobean drama : * Samuel Daniel 's ' ' The Queen 's Arcadia ' ' ( 1606 ) , for publisher Simon Waterson . * The anonymous ' ' Return from Parnassus ' ' ( 1606 ) , for John Wright . * The anonymous ' ' Caesar 's Revenge ' ' ( 1606 ) , also for John Wright . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' ( 1607 ) , again for John Wright . * Day , Rowley , and Wilkins 's ' ' The Travels of the Three English Brothers ' ' ( 1607 ) , once again for Wright . * Thomas Tomkis 's ' ' Lingua ' ' ( 1607 ) , for Simon Waterson . * Lording Barry 's ' ' Ram Alley ' ' ( 1611 ) , for Robert Wilson . * Chapman 's ' ' The Memorable Masque of the Middle Temple and Lincoln 's Inn ' ' ( 1613 ) , for George Norton . * Nathan Field 's ' ' Amends for Ladies ' ' ( 1618 ) , for Matthew Walbancke. # Publisher # Like some printers of his generation -- Richard Field is a good example -- Eld also published work on his own authority . He was active in drama here too : * Eld printed and published both Q1 and Q2 of ' ' The Revenger 's Tragedy ' ' ( 1607 and 1608 ) . The play is now generally attributed to Middleton . * Also , Middleton 's ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' again the first two quartos ( both 1608 ) . A printer who published usually had to arrange for a bookseller to sell the work in question ; the title page of Q2 of ' ' A Trick ' ' specifies that the book is to be sold by Henry Rocket . Yet when the third edition of ' ' A Trick ' ' appeared in 1616 , Eld was no longer the publisher ; he merely printed the volume for bookseller Thomas Langley . * ' ' The Puritan , ' ' one of the plays of the Shakespeare Apocrypha , was published by Eld in 1607 . Another play now generally assigned to Middleton , Eld attributed it to W. S. * Eld published ' ' Northward Ho , ' ' by Thomas Dekker and John Webster , in 1607 . Eld published beyond the confines of Jacobean drama as well , with works like John Healey 's 1610 translation of ' ' The City of God ' ' by St. Augustine . ( That volume bore a dedication to William Herbert , 3rd Earl of Pembroke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of satires by John Taylor the Water Poet called ' ' The Water Cormorant His Complaint ' ' . He published the types of religious books that were so common in his era , like Bishop Gervase Babington 's ' ' Works , Containing Comfortable Notes on the Five Books of Moses ' ' ( 1615 ) . And inevitably , Eld published and printed many now-obscure works by forgotten authors . The title page of his 1606 edition of Robert Pricket 's ' ' Time 's Anatomy ' ' bears the inscription to be sold by John Hodgets -- another demonstration of the printer/publisher 's need for a retail outlet for his products . # Grimeston # In 1607 , Eld printed and published Edward Grimeston 's ' ' A General Inventory of the History of France , ' ' the book that provided Chapman source material for his tragedies on then-recent French history ( including the Byron plays cited above ) . Eld followed this with several other large histories by Grimeston , partnering with fellow stationers Adam Islip , M. Flesher , and William Stansby : ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Islip and G. Eld , 1609 ) , ' ' The General History of Spain ' ' ( A. Islip and G. Eld , 1612 ) , ' ' The General History of the Magnificent State of Venice ' ' ( G. Eld and W. Stansby , 1612 ) , and ' ' A General History of France ' ' ( G. Eld and M. Flesher , 1624 ) .

Before the close of Edward III 's reign , it had removed into Kent and was settled at Halden near Tenterden . The unfortunate Robert de Hales was of this family . Christopher Hales was the son of Thomas Hales . His mother was Alicia , one of the four daughters and co-heirs of Humphrey Eveas . Receiving his legal education at Gray 's Inn , he rose to be an ancient in 1516 , and Autumn Reader in 1524. # Career # On 14 August 1525 , he succeeded Richard Lyster as solicitor-general , and became attorney-general on 3 June 1529 .

He prosecuted Thomas Wolsey by an indictment to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Sir Thomas More and John Fisher on their last arraignment ; and the trials of Queen Anne Boleyn and those charged with being implicated with her occurred during the last few months of his official tenure . On the elevation of Thomas Cromwell to the office of Lord Privy Seal , Hales succeeded him as Master of the Rolls on 10 July 1536 , and retained the place for the five remaining years of his life , having received the honour of knighthood soon after his appointment . In 1540 he was associated with Thomas Cranmer , Lord-chancellor Rich , and other commissioners in the work of remodelling the foundation of Canterbury Cathedral , ousting the monks and supplying their place with secular clergy . He profited largely by the dissolution of the monasteries , obtaining many grants of land which had belonged to them in Kent .

3628514 In computer systems , an access token contains the security credentials for a login session and identifies the user , the user 's groups , the user 's privileges , and , in some cases , a particular application . # Overview # An ' ' access token ' ' is an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread . A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity . While a token is generally used to represent only security information , it is capable of holding additional free-form data that can be attached while the token is being created . Tokens can be duplicated without special privilege , for example to create a new token with lower levels of access rights to restrict the access of a launched application . An access token is used by Windows when a process or thread tries to interact with objects that have security descriptors ( ' ' securable objects ' ' ) . An access token is represented by the system object of type <code> Token </code> . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user logs on to the system and the credentials provided by the user are authenticated against the authentication database . The authentication database contains credential information required to construct the initial token for the logon session , including its user id , primary group id , all other groups it is part of , and other information . The token is attached to the initial process created in the user session and inherited by subsequent processes created by the initial process . Whenever such a process opens a handle to any resource which has access control enabled , Windows reconciles the data in the target object 's security descriptor with the contents of the current effective access token . The result of this access check evaluation is an indication of whether any access is allowed and , if so , what operations ( read , write/modify , etc. ) the calling application is allowed to perform . # Types of tokens # There are two types of tokens : ; Primary token : Primary tokens can only be associated to processes , and they represent a process 's security subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both privileged operations , requiring two different privileges in the name of privilege separation - the typical scenario sees the authentication service creating the token , and a logon service associating it to the user 's operating system shell . Processes initially inherit a copy of the parent process 's primary token . ; Impersonation token : Impersonation is a security concept implemented in Windows NT that allows a server application to temporarily be the client in terms of access to secure objects . Impersonation has four possible levels : ' ' anonymous ' ' , giving the server the access of an anonymous/unidentified user , ' ' identification ' ' , letting the server inspect the client 's identity but not use that identity to access objects , ' ' impersonation ' ' , letting the server act on behalf of the client , and ' ' delegation ' ' , same as impersonation but extended to remote systems to which the server connects ( through the preservation of credentials ) . The client can choose the maximum impersonation level ( if any ) available to the server as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( impersonation initially was not , but historical carelessness in the implementation of client APIs failing to restrict the default level to identification , letting an unprivileged server impersonate an unwilling privileged client , called for it ) . Impersonation tokens can only be associated to threads , and they represent a ' ' client ' ' process 's security subject . Impersonation tokens are usually created and associated to the current thread implicitly , by IPC mechanisms such as DCE RPC , DDE and named pipes . # Contents of a token # A token is composed of various fields , including but not limited to : * an identifier . * the identifier of the associated logon session . The session is maintained by the authentication service , and is populated by the authentication packages with a collection of all the information ( credentials ) the user provided when logging in . Credentials are used to access remote systems without the need for the user to re-authenticate ( single sign-on ) , provided that all the systems involved share an authentication authority ( e.g. a Kerberos ticket server ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important and it 's strictly read-only. * the identifiers of groups the user ( or , more precisely , the subject ) is part of . Group identifiers can not be deleted , but they can be disabled . At most one of the groups is designated as the ' ' session id ' ' , a volatile group representing the logon session , allowing access to volatile objects associated to the session , such as the display . * the restricting group identifiers ( optional ) . This additional set of groups does n't grant additional access , but further restricts it : access to an object is only allowed if it 's allowed ' ' also ' ' to one of these groups . Restricting groups can not be deleted nor disabled . Restricting groups are a recent addition , and they are used in the implementation of sandboxes. * the privileges , i.e. special capabilities the user has . Most privileges are disabled by default , to prevent damage from non-security-conscious programs . Starting in Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 privileges can be permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ </code> with the <code> SEPRIVILEGEREMOVED </code> attribute . * the default owner , primary group and ACL for objects created by the subject associated to the token .

3717514 The Hartland landfill is the waste disposal site for the city of Victoria , British Columbia and the Greater Victoria area . It was purchased by the Capital Regional District in 1975 and has been directly operated by its Environmental Sustainability Department since 1985 . It is located in the District of Saanich on top of a hill , between Victoria and Sidney , at the end of Hartland Avenue . There is a public waste drop-off area , a recycling centre , a household hazardous waste collection facility and an electricity generating station that utilizes landfill gas as a fuel source . It has won several international environmental awards . At current disposal rates it is estimated that the landfill will be full by 2045. # Cycling , Hiking , &amp; Tours # There are varying levels of mountain biking trails for people who wish to use ATB , All Terrain Bikes . These paths are located outside the fenced garbage disposal and processing areas . The cycling , or hiking areas have park signs and water hose stations to clean cycling equipment . The mountain bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Work Regional Park boundaries . The CRD conducts public tours of the Hartland landfill facility , on the subject of waste management , recycling , and capture of waste gas as a supplementary source of electricity generation . # History # The Hartland landfill started as a private dump site in the 1950s . The Hartland landfill was bought by the Capital Regional District in 1975 . As it began to fill up , construction began on phase two in 1997 . This involved blasting out the side of a rock face and covering phase one with dirt and vegetation . This procedure is still taking place . In 2003 the Hartland landfill installed an electricity generating station , to create electricity from the methane gas that was being collected from the decomposing refuse . This generating station now creates 1.6 megawatts of electricity , enough to power about 1,600 homes . After analysis of its garbage composition , the landfill found that 30 percent of its garbage was organic in nature . This has resulted in calls for local food waste collection and composting , which is currently done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular service or as a pilot project . # Procedures and policies # The Hartland landfill is a sanitary landfill , which means that it has a comprehensive system of environmental controls and monitoring programs to mitigate its effects on the environment . Landfill gas created by the decomposition is collected by gas wells and is used for generating electricity . Leachate is collected in two lagoons and it is disposed of through the sanitary sewer system . The landfill has had challenges with the introduction of the non-native species of plants and animals , including the European wall lizard . The Hartland landfill operating bylaw prohibits scavenging of any kind . This is due to safety liability . The Hartland landfill gives free public tours .

3869514 A Defence of Poetry is an essay by the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley , written in 1821 and first published posthumously in 1840 in ' ' Essays , Letters from Abroad , Translations and Fragments ' ' by Edward Moxon in London . It contains Shelley 's famous claim that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world . # Background # The essay was written in response to his friend Thomas Love Peacock 's article The Four Ages of Poetry , which had been published in 1820 . Shelley wrote to the publishers Charles and James Ollier ( who were also his own publishers ) : : I am enchanted with your ' ' Literary Miscellany ' ' , although the last article has excited my polemical faculties so violently that the moment I get rid of my ophthalmia , I mean to set about an answer to it ... It is very clever , but I think , very false . To Peacock Shelley wrote : : Your anathemas against poetry itself excited me to a sacred rage . . . . I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in honour of my mistress Urania . ' ' A Defence of Poetry ' ' was eventually published , with some edits by John Hunt , posthumously by Shelley 's wife Mary Shelley in 1840 in ' ' Essays , Letters from Abroad , Translations and Fragments ' ' . # Editorial introductions # Shelley sought to show that poets make morality and established the legal norms in a civil society thus creating the groundwork for the other branches in a community . In ' ' Gateway to the Great Books ' ' , Volume 5 , Critical Essays , Robert M. Hutchins and Mortimer J. Adler wrote : : : In A Defence of Poetry , Shelley attempts to prove that poets are philosophers ; that they are the creators and protectors of moral and civil laws ; and that if it were not for poets , scientists could not have developed either their theories or their inventions . Poets introduce and maintain morality . The mores so created are codified into laws . The social function or utility of poets is that they create and maintain the norms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Writers ' ' , David Perkins wrote : : : ... Shelley was mainly concerned to explain the moral ( and thus the social ) function of poetry . In doing so , he produced one of the most penetrating general discussions on poetry that we have . # Major themes # Shelleys argument for poetry in his critical essay is written within the context of Romanticism . In 1858 , William Stigant , a poet , essayist , and translator , wrote in his essay Sir Philip Sidney that Shelley 's beautifully written ' ' Defence of Poetry ' ' is a work which analyses the very inner essence of poetry and the reason of its existence , its development from , and operation on , the mind of man . Shelley writes in ' ' Defence ' ' that while ethical science arranges the elements which poetry has created , and leads to a moral civil life , poetry acts in a way that awakens and enlarges the mind itself by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought . In ' ' A Defence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language reveals a human impulse to reproduce the rhythmic and ordered , so that harmony and unity are delighted in wherever they are found and incorporated , instinctively , into creative activities : Every man in the infancy of art , observes an order which approximates more or less closely to that from which highest delight results .. This faculty of approximation enables the observer to experience the beautiful , by establishing a relation between the highest pleasure and its causes . Those who possess this faculty in excess are poets and their task is to communicate the pleasure of their experiences to the community . Shelley does not claim language is poetry on the grounds that language is the medium of poetry ; rather he recognises in the creation of language an adherence to the poetic precepts of order , harmony , unity , and a desire to express delight in the beautiful . Aesthetic admiration of the true and the beautiful is provided with an important social aspect which extends beyond communication and precipitates self-awareness . Poetry and the various modes of art it incorporates are directly involved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. are not only the authors of language and of music , of the dance , and architecture , and statuary , and painting ; they are the institutors of laws , and the founders of civil society .. Social and linguistic order are not the sole products of the rational faculty , as language is arbitrarily produced by the imagination and reveals the before unapprehended relations of things and perpetuates their apprehension of a higher beauty and truth . Shelley 's conclusive remark that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world suggests his awareness of the profound ambiguity inherent in linguistic means , which he considers at once as an instrument of intellectual freedom and a vehicle for political and social subjugation .

3877514 Prostitution in Spain is not addressed by any specific law , but a number of activities related to it such as pimping are illegal . # Legal status # Prostitution ( ' ' Prostitucin ' ' ) was decriminalised in 1995 . Prostitution itself is not directly addressed in the Criminal Code of Spain , but exploitation such as pimping is illegal . The only article in the Code dealing specifically with adult prostitution is Artcle 188 , which bans pimping : # ' ' 1 . El que determine , empleando violencia , intimidacin o engao , o abusando de una situacin de superioridad o de necesidad o vulnerabilidad de la vctima , a persona mayor de edad a ejercer la prostitucin o a mantenerse en ella , ser castigado con las penas de prisin de dos a cuatro aos y multa de 12 a 24 meses . En la misma pena incurrir el que se lucre explotando la prostitucin de otra persona , aun con el consentimiento de la misma ' . # Owning an establishment where prostitution takes place is in itself legal , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ' ' hire ' ' a person to sell sex because prostitution is not considered a job and thus has no legal recognition . # Local government # Local governments differ in their approaches to both indoor and outdoor prostitution , usually in response to community pressure groups , and based on ' public safety ' . Most places do not regulate prostitution , but the government of Catalonia offers licenses for persons to gather people to practice prostitution . These licenses are used by brothel owners to open ' clubs ' , where prostitution takes place ( the women are theoretically only ' gathered ' to work on the premises not employed by the owner ) . Some places have implemented fines for street prostitution . # Politics # # History # Prostitution was tolerated in Spain throughout the mediaeval period , until the 17th century and the reign of Phillip IV ( 162165 ) whose 1623 decree closed the ' ' mancebas ' ' ( brothels ) forcing the women out into the street , a very unpopular decision , but one that remained in place till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18431868 ) regulation was introduced , firstly in cities , the ' ' Disposiciones de Zaragoza ' ' ( 1845 ) and the ' ' Reglamento para la represin de los excesos de la prostitucin en Madrid ' ' ( 1847 ) , followed by the 1848 Penal Code . ( Guerena 2003 , 2008 ) In 1935 during the Second Republic ( 1931-6 ) prostitution was prohibited . Once the Dictatorship ( 193975 ) was established , this law was repealed ( 1941 ) . Spain became officially ' ' abolitionist ' ' on 18 June 1962 , when the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others1949 United Nations ( UN ) Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others was ratified by Spain , and the Decree 168 of 24 January 1963 modified the Penal Code ( ' ' Cdigo Penal ' ' ) according to the Convention . In theory , this policy , in accordance with the Convention , regarded sex workers ( ' ' trabajadores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated punishment of their exploiters rather than the workers themselves , and refused to distinguish between voluntary and coerced sex work . However , there were inconsistencies , as the prostitutes were in fact treated more like criminals : under Act 16/1970 of 4 August on social menace and rehabilitation ( ' ' Ley de peligrosidad y rehabilitacin social ' ' ) prostitutes were declared amongst those classes categorized as social evils , and could be confined to special centres or forbidden to live in specified areas . In practice however , prostitution was quietly ignored and tolerated . Although democracy was restored in 1975 , it was not till the Penal Code revisions of 1995 that this policy was revisited , and most laws regarding prostitution were repealed , with the exception of those governing minors and those with mental health problems . This included the Act 16/1970 . Further revisions in 1999 addressed trafficking , as did the 2000 Immigration Act which followed other European precedents by offering asylum to trafficked victims if they collaborated ( Valiente 2003 ) . In 2012 , at Santa Cruz de Tenerife 91% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opinion remains deeply divided in Spain over prostitution , and law reform has been in a political impasse for a long time . Consequently it remains in rather a grey zone of unregulated but tolerated semi-legality . The standard debates exist as to whether it is work like any other work , or exploitation of women as espoused by groups like ' ' Malostratos ' ' . Meanwhile it thrives , and has prompted headlines such as ' ' El nuevo burdel de Europa ' ' ( The New Brothel of Europe ) . # Public policy # The key instruments in order of importance are the Penal Code ( Cdigo penal ) ( 1822- ) and the Immigration or Aliens Act ( Ley de Extranjera de Espaa ) 2000 . Plans : *Plan Municipal de Intervencin ante la Prostitucin en el municipio 2011-2014 , Santa Cruz de Tenerife # Migrant workers # According to a 2009 TAMPEP study , 90% of sex workers are migrants . Of all countries studied , only Italy had such a high percentage of migrant workers . About 80% of these were Latin American ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see also Laura Oso , 2003 , 2010 ) , however this is changing rapidly due to arrival of Central European migrants ( mainly Romania and Bulgaria ) who now make up 25% compared to 50% from Latin America . There is also considerable cross-border traffic between Spain and Portugal and France . Equally , some 80% of Spanish national workers have worked outside Spain , mainly from economic necessity . This needs to be appreciated in the overall context of Immigration to Spain . As in other countries in Western Europe , there is concern over the presence of migrant workers on the streets and claims that many of them were coerced . In 2008 the Spanish Government announced plans to aid women who had been trafficked . Organisations working with migrant women , include Proyecto Esperanza and shelters such as IPSSE ( Instituto para la Promocin de Servicios Especializados ) In 2012 to September 2013 , was identificated 544 prostitutes in 138 inspections in burdels of Asian prostitutes in Barcelona The 30 November of 2012 , arrest in Cuenca a woman from Paraguay , 34 years old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age # Advocacy # Organisations working with sex workers in Spain include APRAMP ( Associacion para la Prevencin , Reinsercin y Atencin de la Mujer Prostituida ) while sex workers ' rights organisations include Hetaira ( Madrid ) , as well as regional organisations such as SICAR Asturias , AMTTTSE ( Asociacin de Mujeres , Transexuales y Travestis como Trabajadoras Sexuales en Espaa , Mlaga ) and CATS ( Comit de Apoyo a las Trabajadoras del Sexo , Murcia ) . Spanish sex workers continue to be concerned about their lack of protection and in July 2011 petitioned the Minister of Health ( Leire Pajn ) . A demonstration is planned for November 6 , 2011 in Madrid , and a communique has been released setting out sex workers ' complaints and demands . # Social history # Prostitution in Spain was highly sectored , with at one end the ' ' damas cortesanas ' ' of high society , and the mistresses of the bourgeoisie and ' ' barraganas ' ' , the concubines of the clergy .

4005514 Jonathan Edward Caldwell ( born March 24 , 1883 , date of death unknown ) was a self-taught aeronautical engineer who designed a series of bizarre aircraft and started public companies in order to finance their construction . None of these was ever successful , and after his last known attempt in the later 1930s he disappeared , apparently to avoid securities fraud charges . His name was later connected with mythical German flying saucers , and he remains a fixture of the UFO genre to this day . Little of Caldwell 's early life is known , and what has been documented was reconstructed from college records . He appears to have been born in Hensall , Ontario , Canada , the fifth son ( and one of twelve children ) of William Thomas Caldwell ( 1848&amp;ndash ; 1930 ) and Sarah Alice Chamberlain ( 1852&amp;ndash ; 1933 ) . He emigrated to the United States in 1910 , and attended Oregon State College , from 1912 to 1913 , majoring in mechanical engineering . In the 1920s , according to statements he made later in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamentals of aerodynamics. # Cyclogyro # In February 1923 Caldwell filed for a patent on a device he called the cyclogyro . It consisted of an airplane fuselage with two paddle-wheel like attachments in place of the wings . The wheels were powered by an engine in the fuselage , spun to power the upper portion of the attachments forward &amp;ndash ; clockwise , as seen looking left from the cockpit . The wheels each featured four high aspect ratio airfoils , which were able to rotate around their horizontal axis in order to change their pitch . By changing the pitch continually through the entire rotation , the lift of the airfoils could be tuned to produce thrust in any direction . For instance , to lift off vertically the airfoils were pitched to have a positive angle of attack only at the top of their rotation , just generating lift only at that point . In forward flight the angle at the top of the arc would be reduced to make the lift neutral , but they would retain their positive angle even through the forward part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle in this fashion , the aircraft could be lifted in any direction , with differential thrust between the two wings allowing yaw to be applied . Caldwell formed Gravity Aeroplane Company in Reno , Nevada ( Caldwell was living in Santa Monica at the time ) and issued stock in 1928 . Their company stationary included an illustration showing the cyclogyro , a version with four airfoils per wing , attached on the fuselage end to a large disk and the outer end to a cross-like support . # Ornithopter # Caldwell then turned to an even more bizarre aircraft design , an ornithopter . The wings were equipped with flexible fabric valves which were supposed to open on the upstroke and close on the downstroke , allowing it to generate lift with no forward motion and thus provide VTOL service , like the cyclogyro . Caldwell , now living in Denver filed a patent on his new design in December 1927 , which was finally granted as US1730758 in October 1929 . In early 1928 he started another company in Nevada to raise funds to develop it , Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares of stock at ten cents per share , retaining a 51 percent interest . The funds were used to develop a human-powered prototype . By 1931 there was still no working prototype , and Caldwell moved to Orangeburg , New York , and later to Madison , New Jersey . A January 14 , 1932 newsreel film shows the ornithopter being readied for a test . This was apparently attempted without success , by the otherwise unknown Emile Harrier . Additional funds were then raised by another stock issue in order to build a full-sized prototype at Teterboro Airport . He also apparently restarted his cyclogyro work , and an article appeared in one of the Popular Mechanics-like magazines showing the design equipped with a V-8 engine mounted in an odd twin-fuselage with the pilot and passengers below . Before the ornithopter prototype could be completed , the New Jersey Assistant Attorney General charged Caldwell with fraud in September . In his notes , the Attorney , Robert Grossman , noted that no one connected with the company possessed sufficient knowledge of aeronautics to build a practical ship . Caldwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ornithopter prototype until December , as long as no more shares of stock were sold in that time . Grossman also noted that Caldwell had begun work on yet another entirely new design , using a disk wing . In December there was still no prototype , and Caldwell moved the company to New York . The New York Attorney General started questioning the business almost immediately . # Autogyro # In 1934 Caldwell moved again , this time to Washington , DC . In a filing with the Maryland Securities and Exchange Commission he described the company as working solely on a new type of autogyro , which he referred to as a disk-rotor plane . The design consisted of a fairly conventional autogyro layout , but the wing was disk-like instead of the more traditional helicopter-like bladed assembly . The disk had airfoils formed out of fabric on the inside of the rim , and four small solid surfaces on the outside . In forward motion the airstream blowing across the four small surfaces would spin the disk , which would provide lift from the fabric airfoils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be braked to stop it spinning , and unbraked again for a near-vertical landing . The advantage to this arrangement was that there was no theoretical limit on forward speed , whereas a conventional autogyro can not be stopped in flight , and has a limit when the speed of the rearward moving blade approaches the stall speed . Unlike his previous attempts , the disk-rotor aircraft was actually completed between 1936 and 1938 , and was issued a CAA experimental registration number ' ' NX99Y ' ' . In late 1937 or early 1938 a test flight was attempted with the company mechanic at the controls , Willard Driggers . According to later claims ( see below ) , Driggers managed to get the aircraft airborne from the Benning Race Track , and in a panic cut power , causing the aircraft to crash-land , damaging the landing gear . Although damage was minor , Caldwell had apparently already lost interest in the design and did not repair it . # Another autogyro # In 1939 Caldwell shut down Grey Goose and swapped shares once again , forming Rotor Planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his earlier autogyro , but replaced the fuselage with a smaller disk in the center . According to some accounts , around 1940 the Maryland securities commission also started examining Caldwell , who promptly disappeared , abandoning the broken disk-rotor and the partially completed rotorplane. # The USAF investigates # In May 1949 , officers of the U.S. Air Force 's Project Sign received a letter from a Gray Goose shareholder , who explained that the company had been building aircraft similar to the flying saucers which were then a popular topic in the press . This was during the UFO craze following Kenneth Arnold 's reports of seeing UFO 's over Mount Rainier and the Roswell Incident that followed . The Air Force had canvassed for reports of flying saucers , and the shareholder apparently felt that Caldwell 's disk-rotor might explain them . Tracking down the leads , the team , accompanied by the Maryland Police , visited an abandoned farm in Glen Burnie , Maryland ( outside Baltimore ) , where the damaged remains of Caldwell 's disk-rotor aircraft were discovered . They also tracked down Driggers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1937/8 . The team reported that the prototypes could not be responsible for the flying saucer reports that were being received from all around the country . Photographs of the broken disk-rotor machine continue to appear in UFOs books to this day . They were often described as crashed flying saucers in earlier works , claiming it was one more example of the USAF being in possession of such vehicles . More recently they are normally connected with the claims that the Nazis had built working flying saucers late in the war , lumped together with other disk-shaped aircraft like the Avrocar , Arthur Sack A.S.6 and Vought V-173 , in an effort to demonstrate that such aircraft were both possible and well-researched. # Personal life # In 1909/10 , Caldwell married Olive E Davis . Caldwell emigrated to the United States in 1910 . In 1930 , Caldwell was living in Denver with his wife , Olive E Caldwell ( 48 , born Wisconsin ) and son Carl Davis Caldwell ( July 17 , 1917 , Montana &amp;ndash ; November 27 , 1993 , Cupertino , California ) .

4196514 The National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies ( NACCS ) is the academic organization that serves academic programs , departments and research centers that focus on issues pertaining to Mexican Americans , Chicana/os , and Latina/os. cite web # History # NACCS was formed in 1972 in San Antonio , Texas , when attendees of the yearly meeting of the Southwestern Social Science Association discussed the need for a national association of Chicana/o scholar activists . Discussants proposed the foundation of a National Caucus of Chicano Social Scientists ( NCCSS ) . The NCCSS held its first meeting in New Mexico in May 1973 to discuss the organization 's structure , ideology , and to set up a coordinating committee . At another meeting at the University of California , Irvine in November of the same year , the organization was officially named the National Association of Chicano Social Scientists ( NACSS ) . In 1976 , members voted to rename the organization National Association for Chicano Studies . In 1995 , the organization was again renamed . Members chose the name National Association for Chicana and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chicanas in the association . # Structure # The association is led by a coordinating committee made up of representatives from nine regional focos and the chairs of 8 caucuses . The coordinating committee selects a national coordinator , secretary , and treasurer from among its ranks . In 2006 , the membership began electing a chair , secretary , treasurer and three at-large representatives to the coordinating committee . The committee , now reorganized as a board , established a subgroup called Research Divisions . # Activities # NACCS hosts an annual conference at which scholars present research papers from the social sciences , humanities , and other fields of study . The first such conference was held in Irvine in 1974 , and was titled Action Research : Community Control . Today , conferences attract from 800 to 1500 participants and as many as 85 presenters . The association also awards an annual NACCS Scholar Award , which is intended to honor a lifetime of accomplishment in the field of Chicano and Chicana studies .

4202514 The 1972 Miami Dolphins season was the teams seventh season , and third season in the National Football League . The 1972 Dolphins are the only National Football League team to win the Super Bowl with a perfect season . The undefeated campaign was led by coach Don Shula and notable players Bob Griese , Earl Morrall , and Larry Csonka . The 1972 Dolphins went 140 in the regular season and won all three post-season games , including Super Bowl VII against the Washington Redskins , to finish 170 . The team remains the only NFL team to complete an entire season undefeated and untied from the opening game through the Super Bowl ( or championship game ) . In addition , the Dolphins continued their winning streak to 18 straight games ( regular season and post-season ) , before losing in the second week of the 1973 season . During the 1972 season , Bob Grieses ankle was broken in Week 5 as he was sacked by San Diego Chargers defensive tackle Ron East and defensive end Deacon Jones . He was replaced by veteran Earl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the field as a substitute during the AFC Championship game versus the Pittsburgh Steelers and then started for Miami in Super Bowl VII . On the ground , running backs Larry Csonka and Mercury Morris became the first teammates to each rush for 1,000 yards in a season . Paul Warfield led the receivers , averaging over 20 yards per catch on 29 receptions . The offensive line included future Hall of Fame members Jim Langer and Larry Little and Pro Bowler Norm Evans . The 1972 Dolphins defensive unit , called the ' ' No-Name Defense ' ' because Miamis impressive offense received much more publicity , as well as Cowboy 's coach , Tom Landry , coining the phrase in an interview , was the leagues best that year . It was led by linebacker Nick Buoniconti , end Bill Stanfill , tackle Manny Fernandez , and safeties Dick Anderson and Jake Scott .

Coach Don Shula tried to play down the myth by saying that two players , Dick Anderson and Nick Buoniconti , who live near each other sometimes have a toast together . However , in a college football broadcast on ABC , following the loss of an undefeated team , Bob Griese , after being asked by his colleague , commented that he called former Dolphins , and they had Diet Cokes together . That celebration comes with the connotation that they no longer drink alcoholic beverages , but that a toast was customary . # The perfect season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute a perfect regular season in the post-merger NFL . They are the only team in NFL history to go undefeated and untied in the regular season and postseason . An enduring controversy is that the 1972 Dolphins played a soft schedule not possible under the current scheduling formula . Prior to the implementation of position scheduling in 1978 , opponents were set by the NFL on a rotating basis . Statistically , the Dolphins 1972 regular-season opponents had an aggregate winning percentage of .397 and only two opponents had winning records that year ( both were 86 ) . This is not however a record : the 1975 Minnesota Vikings , who began 100 and finished 122 , played fourteen opponents with an average winning percentage of .332 and nine of their games were against teams 410 or worse .

Super Bowl VII , in fact , was the first game to be televised in the market of origin under new rules which would come into effect the following season games must be sold out within 72 hours of kickoff time in order to be aired in the market of origin .

In 1901 , with problems in Sheffield caused by the high price of fuel and an adverse American tariff the company was having difficulty offering competitive prices to its U.S. customers . Following an amalgamation of some U.S. crucible steel makers , which would make competition even harder , it was considered that a successful melting facility could be set up in the U.S.A. Many British steel-makers considered that the Made in England or Made in Sheffield marks were a big selling point for their materials , however Jessop 's did not hold the view and considered that they could use their Sheffield name on steel which was made in America . # J.J. Saville &amp; Company # J.J.Saville were Sheffield crucible steel and file makers based at Libau Works in the city . # Rationalisation # It was seen in the mid-1960s that some rationalisation was needed within the Sheffield steel industry , particularly steel founding . With respect to this Jessop Saville separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Osborn &amp; Company , Edgar Allen and Company and Hadfields Limited . The intention was to merge the foundry interests of the four companies to form one large steel foundry with the capability of making castings from a few ounces to 40 tons , with only English Steel Corporation 's Grimesthorpe foundry in the city able to make larger . As negotiations were taking place the deal fell through leaving Osbourne 's and Hadfield 's to merge , with the foundry being located on Hadfield 's East Hecla ( Vulcan Road ) site , and Edgar Allen 's to purchase Jessop 's , relocating Jessop 's special alloy ( medium frequency ) melting on Edgar 's Sheffield Road site and the 3-ton electric furnace at their Imperial Steel Works site . # Whiston Grange Research Centre # Following the end of World War II , Service Camps were set up to house returning troops , Polish soldiers , prisoners of war , teachers and building craftsmen in training . From 1946 Whiston Grange , near Rotherham , was used for this purpose , however , by 1950 , it had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titanium and its alloys . Research work on Jessop 's alloys and special materials for the aerospace industry was carried out in the laboratories , and it was also here that the initial work on the casting of Titanium and its alloys took place . The tie-up with Edgar Allen released foundry space at Brightside Lane and in early 1967 it was decided to convert the research carried out at Whiston Grange into the installation of the world 's first commercial casting plant for titanium and titanium alloys on the Brightside Lane site . In the late 1960s , BSA , the owners of Jessop Saville , sold their titanium interests to IMI who absorbed Jessop 's alloys into their range . # Closure # The Brightside Lane site was closed in the late 1980s and cleared . It lay dormant for several years before being sold and laid out as an office park , being known as Jessop 's Riverside . # Up to date # In February 1998 , Special Melted Products Limited , a Sheffield based melting and remelting specialists , and Jessop Saville Limited were acquired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessops specialist products , particularly their non-magnetic drill collars and downhole components for the oil and gas industry . # Philanthropy # Situated in Figtree Lane , in Sheffield city centre , a hospital for sick women was founded by three local doctors . Having only six beds , later extended to nine , it soon outgrew the building ( which still stands and in use as solicitors offices ) and a search was made for land on which to build a new hospital . A site was found in Levygreave , then on the edge of the city centre , and in 1875 , Thomas Jessop provided the funds to buy the site and build the Jessop Hospital for Sick Women . The hospital , which was opened in 1878 , and named after its benefactor , closed in 2000 . The site is now being used by the University of Sheffield Biosciences Department and a new women 's wing , known as The Jessop Wing , was added to the city 's Royal Hallamshire Hospital .

4236514 rescatchment = Ryan Dam is a hydroelectric dam on the Missouri River , ten miles ( 16 km ) downstream from the city of Great Falls in the U.S. state of Montana . The dam is 1336 ft long and 61 ft high ; its reservoir is 7 mi long and has a storage capacity of . It is a run-of-river dam . The dam is built on the largest of the five Great Falls of the Missouri , and these specific falls are also called Great Falls . Since 1915 , the six-unit powerhouse on the left side of the dam has occupied a significant portion of the 87ft m high waterfall . The dam , built just upstream of the falls and a small island named Ryan Island , is divided into two parts . On the right side of the dam is a concrete-arch spillway structure , that when functioning , releases water over the remains of the waterfall . The center part of the dam consists of a dike that extends from the falls ' base to Ryan Island ( separating the tailrace from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards downstream ) . It also contains a concrete gravity structure facing towards the right bank of the river and tilted to face slightly downstream . This segment of the dam contains the outlet works , a water jet that bursts out and cascades over the waterfall . The left side of the dam is a large powerhouse topped by a concrete gravity structure . Since the dam 's construction in the Missouri River gorge , it has flooded a fair portion of the Great Falls - the cascades between Grand Fall and Crooked Falls , which lies several miles upstream - and reduced the flow over Great Falls to such an extent that much of the bedrock is visible . The dam was constructed on top of a 10ft m cascade that Lewis and Clark observed to lie just upstream of Grand Fall . Upstream of Ryan Dam the next dam is Cochrane Dam , then Rainbow Dam , and the uppermost is Black Eagle Dam . Downstream of Ryan Dam the next dam is Morony Dam . 
4269514 The Windy City Pace is a harness race for 3-year-old Standardbred pacing horses . It has been run annually since 1983 at Maywood Park in Melrose Park , Illinois , a suburb of Chicago . The race was originally run during Maywood 's spring meet , but since 1991 the race has been run during the fall meet . In past years , elimination heats were required to determine the finalists for the main race . The race is the top race of a program that also features Mayood 's other top stakes , the Abe Lincoln , the Galt , and the Cinderella . Among the notable runnings of the Windy City was the 1987 race , where Bomb Rickles won the final at odds of 190-1. # Past winners # class = sortable border= 1 cellpadding= 1 style= border-collapse : collapse ; font-size:90% 2009 In Over My Head Dale Hiteman 01:52.20

4275514 This is a list of items from the BBC television series ' ' The Sarah Jane Adventures ' ' . # B # # Berserker Pendant # Berserker Pendants were talismans created by Berserkers which gave the bearer the ability to order people to do as they wished . A Pendant would also slowly changed the person using it into a Berserker . Each time it was used , the Pendant would slightly change the bearer both physically and mentally until the bearer desired to complete the transformation into a Berserker . During transformation the user develops prominent veins over the skin 's surface . The final form has the appearance of a man wearing animal skins . The only cure , if done early enough , is to remind the affected person who they are so that the memories will reassert their identity . According to UNIT archives , a Berserker Pendant surfaced in a barracks in Ealing in 1940 , but was lost during a German bombing raid . This same Pendant was rediscovered by Jacob , who used it for a time until it frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed it in Sarah Jane Smith 's attic . It was then discovered by Paul Langer , who stole it and used it to take control of his son Clyde . Mr Langer was almost completely possessed by the power of the Pendant until his wife and son reminded him of who he really was . Clyde then used to Pendant to erase his mother 's memories of the incident , then disposed of it in the sea . # Biodamper # Martin Trueman had a biodamper to hide the fact that he had the Ancient lights which was the reason for Sarah Jane not able to detect that he was alien which left her thinking he was human . Secrets of the Stars . # The Brigadier 's Walking stick # The Brigadier used a very special cane that was also a kind of gun . He used it to shoot the UNIT personnel , Major Kilburn , who was actually Bane and was going to consume him and Rani. # Bubbleshock # A popular and addictive soft drink seen in Invasion of the Bane . It was vital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each bottle of Bubbleshock contained a piece of living Bane , secreted by the Bane Mother , and was otherwise a mixture of ' fresh spring water and fruit juices ' , according to Davey . When the Bane Mother ' reached out ' , the Bane inside was able to take control of the human host , commanding non-controlled humans to drink Bubbleshock . After the Bane factory was destroyed by Luke Smith , killing the Bane Mother , the mind control ceased . # C # # Compressor # A device worn by the Slitheen around their necks to generate a compression field which shrinks them down , allowing them to fit into skinsuits . In ' ' Revenge of the Slitheen ' ' , as in ' ' Doctor Who ' ' it is only capable of letting them fit into the skins of large people , and the resulting gas exchange results in something unto flatulence ; by the time of ' ' The Lost Boy ' ' , however , both these problems have been fixed , allowing them to pass for much smaller humans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural form of the Xylok ; owing to a spaceship crash the entire Xylok race has been trapped under the Earth 's crust for most of the planet 's existence . It is capable of interfacing with Earth computers , and eventually gives Sarah Jane the instructions to build Mr Smith . # E # # Entanglement shells # Seen in ' ' Warriors of Kudlak ' ' , entanglement shells are generated by teleportation from Kudlak 's teleportation of children from the Combat 3000 lasertag game . # G # # Graske gun # Seen in ' ' Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane ? ' ' . The gun is capable of ' tagging ' a Graske victim and teleporting them alongside the Graske to Limbo , although the victim is capable of breaking free . Once the person has been placed in Limbo , firing the gun will free them . # Graske teleporter # Another of the Graske 's devices , the teleporter is attached to their clothing and will transport them , as well as anyone ' tagged ' at the time . It is capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Mobile phone # Portable telephones used in the 21st century . Sarah Jane and her companions own mobile phones ; however , as a repeating theme of their adventures , their phones either get taken away and never found , or are simply destroyed . In The Man that Never Was , Luke explains to Sky , when their phones are destroyed , that he 's had seven phones in the last four years . # Meteorite # Seen in The Day Of The Clown , the inhabitant energies of this meteorite could manifest a physical form from emotions . The entity featured in the episode created its form from fear , and manifested as the Pied Piper of Hamelin and later as Mr. Spellman and Oddbob The Clown . The Meteorite was present at the pharos insituite were Sarah Jane Smith was able ( but did n't ask ) to cut a piece off with her Sonic Lipstick . # P # # Portal # A large stone basin seen in St. Agnes ' nunnery in ' ' Eye of the Gorgon ' ' . It requires the Talisman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves as a link between the Gorgon homeworld and Earth . # S # # Scanner watch # One of the Tenth Doctor 's parting gifts to Sarah Jane , the scanner watch appears as a normal watch but has a lift-up top showing a scanner screen that allows it to scan for alien life . This is seen to work in two ways in Invasion of the Bane : firstly , she can scan anyone to identify their species , and secondly it automatically acts as a ' geiger counter ' of sorts , making an increasingly louder noise as it gets closer to alien sources . In ' ' Revenge of the Slitheen ' ' , it is apparently capable of connecting to the local power grid , and Sarah Jane states that it ' never ' loses power . Like a geiger counter , it made louder noises as it got closer to an alien source . In ' ' Secrets of the Stars ' ' Zodiac reader Martin Trueman wore a biodamper and when sarah jane tried to detect if he was alien she was unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alien . # Skinsuit # As seen in ' ' Revenge of the Slitheen ' ' and later ' ' The Lost Boy ' ' . It is a ' suit ' made from the Slitheens ' murdered and skinned victims , allowing them to pose as humans . Initially only large people can be used as disguises owing to the limits of the compression field ( see compressor ) , although superior technology is seen in ' ' The Lost Boy ' ' . # Slitheen teleporter # A Slitheen teleport disguised as a necklace . The Slitheen using the human disguise of Janine wears a necklace in ' ' Revenge of the Slitheen ' ' , although only the official website identifies it as a teleport . The Slitheen in ' ' The Lost Boy ' ' also have a teleport ; whereas the Slitheen posing as Margaret Blaine in the ' ' Doctor Who ' ' episodes Aliens of London , World War Three and Boom Town had a teleport that was in three separate pieces , which had to be connected to work and could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have coordinates fed in. # Sonic lipstick # Another of the Tenth Doctor 's gifts to Sarah Jane , the sonic lipstick is essentially a sonic screwdriver disguised as a lipstick ( although the official site states that it is useless in this regard ) . The sonic lipstick looked like a normal lipstick on the outside . The lid came off and it twisted to reveal the emitter . When in use , the sonic lipstick generated a pinkish-red light , and produced several sounds . Its primary function in the series has been to unlock doors , although like the sonic screwdriver it can not unlock deadlock seals . She uses this device in Journey 's End as well . Although there were known to be two distinct sonic lipsticks carried by Sarah Jane , the two units coexisted for an unknown length of time . As a result of this coexistence , it is unknown which particular unit was used in any given occurrence prior to the destruction of the one . # Spray canister # A canister containing a special spray seen in Invasion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down a small flight of stairs into a wall and forces it to reassert its human disguise ; in the process , however , Sarah Jane uses up her last canister of the spray . The escaping Bane leaves behind a small pool of a sticky black substance ; it is unclear if this is related to the spray 's effects or not . # Summoning device # A communicator used to signal across planets given to Sarah Jane by a Star Poet from Arcateen 5 she helped get home . It is stated to be more or less a mobile phone , only many times more powerful . Luke Smith eventually uses the device to badly shock the Bane Mother , which results in the destruction of the Bane factory . # T # # Talisman # Seen in ' ' Eye of the Gorgon ' ' , the Talisman fell into the possession of Bea Nelson-Stanley after her husband was killed ; she gave it to Luke Smith . The Talisman was required to open a portal to the Gorgons ' homeworld , and was also capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original state . # Telekinetic headset # One of the headsets developed by the Pharos Institute project in ' ' The Lost Boy ' ' using alien technology , assisted by the Slitheen . It is used to allow people to move objects using only their mind ; although a normal human collapses after sustained use , Luke is capable of withstanding it without any apparent side effects . Sarah Jane steals one of the headsets on the instructions of Mr Smith in the second part of the story , whilst the Slitheen use it to drain Luke of telekinetic energy , with which they can sell ; if all the energy is drained from somebody , then they will die . Sarah Jane foils Mr Smith 's attempt to use one of the headsets in conjunction with Luke ; it is unknown what happens to the Institute afterwards . It is also known as M.I.T.R.E . # Transductor # A Slitheen device seen in ' ' Revenge of the Slitheen ' ' . It can be used to take and store massive amounts of electrical energy , although a calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke Smith gives the Slitheen the calculation by mistake , they use it first to turn out the power worldwide , and then the Sun ; following this it will be slightly over half an hour before the Earth 's atmosphere is snatched away . Luke states that the machine will explode when drawing power from the Sun , as it will overload ; it is unclear if he is telling the truth or not . He eventually tricks the Slitheen into resetting the machine , restoring the power worldwide and switching the Sun back on , and then , using the sonic lipstick , causes it to explode . The unstable machine is capable of disintegrating anybody in close proximity . # V # # Verron soothsayer 's puzzle box # An alien puzzle box seen in ' ' Whatever Happened to Sarah Jane ?

Anyone holding the puzzlebox is immune to the effects of the Trickster 's ability to wipe out the history of a person , in the regard that they alone will be able to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson , saying that the soothsayer said to give it to someone she trusted . Maria later used the box to save Sarah Jane when the Trickster swapped her life with that of her friend Andrea Yates who had died during their school days .

The box continued to protect Clyde and Rani from Krislok , a Graske working as the Trickster 's agent . In exchange for helping them defeat the Trickster , Clyde gave the Graske the box to protect him should the Trickster ever seek revenge . # Verron soothsayer 's warp star # A Warp star was a small pendant shaped device which contained enough energies within its small form to create a powerful explosion .

4286514 A breaker is a piece of reef against which waves break . This sense of the term is closely related to another sense , that of the breaking wave itself . In times past , when ocean navigation was relatively rudimentary , a line of breaking waves was a crucial indicator that a boat was bearing down upon an island or reef . This was especially the case when sailing in darkness , in which the highly visible line of froth caused by breaking waves could be the only such indicator . In such cases the line of breakers was charted and named as a breaker .

4304514 In automotive design , an M4 , or Mid-engine , Four-wheel-drive layout places the internal combustion engine in the middle of the vehicle , between both axles and drives all four road wheels . It is a type of car powertrain layout . Although the term mid-engine can mean the engine is placed anywhere in the car such that the centre of gravity of the engine lies between the front and rear axles , it is usually used for sports cars and racing cars where the engine is behind the passenger compartment . The motive output is then sent down a shaft to a differential in the centre of the car , which in the case of an M4 layout , distributes power to both front and rear axles . The centre differential contained within many 4 wheel drive cars is similar to the conventional differential in a 2 wheel drive car . It allows torque to be distributed to both drive axles whilst allowing them to spin at different speeds , which vastly improves the cornering of a 4 wheel drive car on surfaces with high grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drive axles which are configured to provide torque equally to both wheels , the centre differential is usually set to have a bias to one set of drive wheels or the other , depending on application of the car . Some 4 wheel drive cars use a centre viscous coupling unit that will provide most power to the rear wheels unless the amount of torque being supplied to the rear wheels is in excess of the traction limits of the rear tyres , such as in a Lamborghini Murcilago . Others contain a computer that will decide how much power to distribute to any wheel at any time depending on the circumstances of each wheel . In general the M4 system is not widely used as it is suited toward sports cars and some off-road racing vehicles . # Benefits # The engine is usually where the weight of a car is most concentrated so placing it between the front and rear axles gives a car a much better handling balance . Assuming the engine is behind the passenger compartment , the engine will also be pushing down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted toward the rear under acceleration in all cars as a rule , this further improves the amount of grip on the rear wheels , increasing the amount of torque that can be supplied to the rear wheels before wheelspin occurs . Because the engine is not in the front , the car can be designed with a minimum amount of frontal area perpendicular to the wind , greatly increasing aerodynamic efficiency . A computer-controlled four-wheel-drive differential system allows a car to both accelerate and corner more quickly , since it can vary the amount of torque going to the front and rear wheels , and therefore vary how much the car behaves like a front- or rear-wheel-drive car . This means that through a fast corner the car is able to display more neutral handling - with less oversteer or understeer . This is a much more efficient means of turning and allows for faster cornering speeds as opposed to a two-wheel or conventional four-wheel-drive system . # Drawbacks # Such a system is very difficult and expensive to design and engineer , which is why it is only usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most mid-engine cars , because of the size and position of the engine and transmission , compromise heavily on both passenger and boot/trunk space . Four-wheel-drive systems tend to be quite heavy and some of the engine 's power can be lost through the various differentials in the car , in addition to the frictional losses of the powertrain . The variable handling characteristics of a four-wheel-drive car mean that when travelling round a corner at high speeds the car may enter the corner and understeer and then half-way through the corner suddenly start to oversteer.

4369514 image =Carl Christian Joseph of Saxony.jpeg birthplace = Dresden deathplace = Dresden Prince Karl Christian Joseph of Saxony ( 13 July 1733 &amp;ndash ; 16 June 1796 ) was a German prince from the House of Wettin and Duke of Courland . Born in Dresden , he was the fifth but third surviving son of Augustus III , King of Poland and Elector of Saxony , and Maria Josepha of Austria . # Life # # Causes of his election as Duke of Courland # The Duke of Courland and guardian of the Russian Tsar Ivan VI , Ernst Johann von Biron -- because of his extravagances and autocratic government , was hated by the Russian aristocracy -- was removed from the regency upon the agreement of the Tsar 's mother Anna Leopoldovna in 1740 and arrested . The attempts of Anna Leopoldovna in making herself a popular regent failed and her Prime Minister Burkhard Christoph von Munnich who had organized the conspiracy against Biron was dismissed because of political and personal differences between both . Afterwards , a plot surrounding the Grand Duchess Elisabeth Petrovna against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her son Ivan and the rest of their family were exiled to Riga . Now , certainly , the Tsarina Elisabeth gave her pardon to Biron ; however , because of fear that he could again return to great power such as he had obtained during his old reign , she refused to restore to him his old dignities and the Duchy of Courland . To occupy the new headship of the Duchy , the local knighthood under pressure from Saxony and Poland chose the favorite son of the Polish king Prince Karl Christian in 1758 as their new Duke . The young prince had previously travelled to St. Petersburg from which came the agreement of Tsarina Elisabeth , confirming these plans from their part . # Duke of Courland and Semigallia # Most of Evangelic Courland aristocracy had big doubts about Karl largely because they feared a Roman Catholic Duke would drive back his influence in favor of the Polish-Roman Catholic State and tried to limit Karls means by a contract formulated electoral surrender . Before these negotiations could come to their conclusion , his father appointed him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 January 1759 with the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia . Thereupon Karl who had signed now only a very much generally regarded assurance to religious questions and aristocratic privileges traveled to Courland and , on 29 March 1759 , he solemnly entered the capital of his duchy , Mitau . After the Courland Diet ( ' ' Landtag ' ' ) and the States had met , they lost their hope of wringing a statement from Karl , nevertheless , they still favored him . Appropriately many aristocrats refused to homage the dukes appointment on 3 November 1759 and instead waged protest in Warsaw and St. Petersburg . # Renunciation of the Duchy and later life # When in July 1762 the Tsarina Catherine the Great who had been unapproving of Duke Karl on the basis of his lacking interest in the mental education of his subjects took the Russian throne after a coup d ' tat . She allowed the now entirely rehabilitated Biron to return from his exile and exercised a substantial diplomatic pressure on Saxony with the purpose of restoring him to his old office as Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his declined health but also by the consequences of the Seven Years ' War accepted the fate of his son and denied his support to him . Without any support , Karl had to renounce the Duchy in 1763 and he then returned to Saxony . His hopes to win back the Duchy of Courland scattered after the quick death of his father and the loss of the Polish Crown for the Saxon Electors . Thereupon Karl lived in Dresden ; however , dedicated himself farther to the hunt in the Annaburger Heath . Karl died in Dresden at age sixty-two . He was buried in the Marienstern Monastery ( Kloster Marienstern ) of Mhlberg. # Secret Marriage and Issue # In Warsaw on 21 March 1760 Karl secretly married Franciszka Corvin-Krasiska , daughter of Count Stanislaus Corvin-Krasiski . Because Franziska did not belong to a ruling dynasty or immediate noble family , the marriage was morganatic .

Barbour attended the public schools in New Haven , and subsequently enrolled at the Phillips Exeter Academy . He was the captain of Exeter 's football team in 1888. # Yale University # Barbour attended Yale University and graduated Ph.B. at Yale 's Sheffield Scientific School in 1892 . While at Yale , he was the quarterback of the Yale Bulldogs football teams of 1890 and 1891 . The 1891 Yale team was coached by Walter Camp and included College Football Hall of Fame inductees , Pudge Heffelfinger , Frank Hinkey , Josh Hartwell and Lee McClung . With Barbour as the starting quarterback , the 1891 team finished with a perfect 130 record and a national championship . In November 1891 , ' ' The New York Times ' ' wrote : Barbour has made great improvements since last year , and is one of the best men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and sure , uses his signals to good advantage and is an excellent player .

It is an analysis of the interchange between soccer and the new global economy . The author takes readers on a journey from stadium to stadium around the globe in an attempt to shed new insights on todays world events , both from political and economic standpoints . Soccer is here the globalized medium that seems to lend itself to explaining the effects globalization has on society as a whole . # Themes # # Failure of globalization # In the first part of the book , Foer tries to explain the failure of globalization to erode ancient hatreds in the games great rivalries , commonly referred to as football hooliganism . His case studies include sectarian conflicts between supporters of Celtic F.C . and Rangers F.C . ( the Old Firm ) in Scotland and the tendency of supporters of Tottenham Hotspur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminology ( such as yid ) , causing some opposing supporters to employ antisemtic chants and taunts. # Rise of corporate hegemons # In the second part of the text , the author uses soccer to address economics : the consequences of migration , the persistence of corruption , and the rise of powerful new oligarchs like Silvio Berlusconi , the President of both Italy and the AC Milan club . # Persistence of nationalism and tribalism # In the final part , Foer uses soccer to defend the virtues of old-fashioned nationalism , as a way to blunt the return of tribalism . The book thus challenges theories that a universal , globalist philosophy will subsume local nationalisms . Overarching structures such as the European Union and the United Nations may attain structural prominence , but underneath the veneer of these structures , vibrant sub-cultures and tribal loyalties remain , and may even be strengthened by modern communications like the Internet .

4580514 # Ultrasound Energy # Ultrasound energy , simply known as ultrasound , is a type of mechanical energy called sound characterized by vibrating or moving particles within a medium . Ultrasound is distinguished by vibrations with a frequency greater than 20,000 Hz , compared to audible sounds that humans typically hear with frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz . Ultrasound energy requires matter or a medium with particles to vibrate to conduct or propagate its energy . The energy generally travels through most mediums in the form of a wave in which particles are deformed or displaced by the energy then reestablished after the energy passes . Types of waves include shear , surface , and longitudinal waves with the latter being one of the most common used in biological applications . The characteristics of the traveling ultrasound energy greatly depend on the medium that it is traveling through . While ultrasound waves propagate through a medium , the amplitude of the wave is continually reduced or weakened with the distance it travels . This is known as attenuation and is due to the scattering or deflecting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the energy to heat energy within the medium . A medium that changes the mechanical energy from the vibrations of the ultrasound energy into thermal or heat energy is called viscoelastic . The properties of ultrasound waves traveling through the medium of biological tissues has been extensively studied in recent years and implemented into many important medical tools . # Common Medical Applications of Ultrasound Energy # # Diagnostic Imaging # As stated above , properties of ultrasound energy traveling through biological tissues has been extensively studied in recent years . The attenuation due to scattering of energy in different tissues can be measured by a device called a transducer . Recorded information from transducers such as the relationship to the site of origin and intensity of the signal can then be put together to form images of what lies inside the target tissues . Higher frequency ultrasound waves generally produce higher resolution images , but attenuation also increases as frequency increases which restricts imaging depth . Consequently , the best frequency has been determined for each type of diagnostic test and body tissue . Some of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Doppler techniques . These test produce images ranging from one-dimensional images to moving , real-time two dimensional images that can often be seen immediately on a screen . The advent of ultrasound technology has completely changed the medical diagnostic field due to its non-invasive characteristic . Medical professionals can now observe tissues within the body without having to physically enter the body . This reduces the amount of invasive and risky diagnostic procedures and increases the chances of a correct diagnosis . Some common medical imaging procedures include : *Sonogram- Ultrasound images of an unborn fetus are used to check for proper development and other characteristics . *Tumor/Cancer Diagnosis- Images can be used to examine suspicious masses found inside the body and determine if other treatment is necessary . *Blood Flow- Images can be used to examine the flow of blood through specific vessels and examine if there is any blockage or abnormalities. *Internal Organs- Images can be used to look at the physical shape and movements of internal organs to insure they are working properly . # Oncology Treatment # One characteristic of ultrasound previously discussed is that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mechanical wave energy to thermal energy . Researchers and doctors have made medical applications to harness this heat conversion and use it in successful medical procedures . Ultrasound energy is a form of therapy being studied as an anticancer treatment . Intensified ultrasound energy can be directed at cancer cells to heat them and kill them . Recent testing has shown that ultrasound can increase the effectiveness of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy . This procedure is known as heat or hyperthermia therapy . By using the converted heat energy that ultrasound provides , specific diseased tissues can be heated often to temperatures around 41 to 45C . This increase in temperature has been linked to improved effectiveness of cancer treatment due to dilation of blood vessels and increased oxygen presence in affected tissues . Another new treatment called HIFU ( High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ) takes advantage of the thermal energy characteristics of ultrasound . HIFU uses an ultrasound device that is able to precisely focus ultrasound waves at a target tissue or specific group of cells . At the focus of this ultrasound energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly spontaneous coagulative necrosis or cell death without harming neighboring cells . This treatment greatly expands the ability of doctors to be able to destroy cancer cells noninvasively . Currently , many test are being carried out to determine the effectiveness of the treatment on different tissues , but testing has already shown promising results in the field of prostate cancer . # ' ' References ' ' # *Hamilton , Elizabeth .

4590514 Somdet Phra Sanphet VIII ( ) or Suriyenthrathibodi ( ) was the King of Ayutthaya from 1703 to 1709 and the second ruler of the Ban Phlu Luang Dynasty . Suriyenthrathibodi was also known by the noble title he held before ascending the throne , Luang Sorasak ( ) . He was the eldest son of the founder of the Ban Phlu Luang dynasty , Phetracha. # Tiger King # The citizens in his time gave him the name Phra Chao Suea ( Tiger King ) , for he was , according to the official chronicles , as evil as tiger .

' ' The Chronicle of Ayutthaya , Phan Chanthanumat ( Choem ) ' s Edition ' ' , described his behaviour as follows : # His Majesty habitually pleased himself with liquor and intercourse with the female children under 11-12 years of age . If any female was unable to endure him and writhed in pain , His Majesty would become furious and bestow a penalty upon her by crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female could maintain her tolerance without struggle , His Majesty would be elated and bestow upon her certain gratuities and rewards . # # Furthermore , when His Majesty took a trip to any canal , sea , island or any other place full of sharks , sawfish and other aquatic beings , he always drank liquor . If any concubine , lady , page or official caused his barge shaken , His Majesty would exercise no judgment and express no mercy , but would be enraged and order the person to be dragged with a hook and thrown into water to be consumed by sharks and sawfish . # # Moreover , His Majesty never maintained himself in the five precepts . He gratified himself by having intercourse with the wives of the government officers . From that time onwards , he was given the name the ' Tiger King ' . # ' ' The Chronicle of Ayutthaya , British Museum 's Version ' ' , also contained the like : # At that time , the king was of vulgar mind , uncivil behaviour , savage conduct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only in the activities which breached the royal traditions . Also , he lacked inhibition , but was consumed by unholy sin . Eternal were anger and ignorance in his mind . And the king habitually drank liquor and pleased himself by having intercourse with the female children not yet attaining the age of menstruation . In this respect , if any female was able to endure him , that female would be granted a great amount of rewards , money , gold , silks and other cloth . Should any female be incapable of bearing with him , he would be enraged and strike a sword at her heart , putting her to death . The caskets were every day seen to be called into the palace to contain the female dead bodies and to be brought out of the palace through a royal gate at the end of the royal confinement mansion . That gate thereby gained the name the ' Gate of Ghosts ' until now . # # References #

4689514 Elizabeth Baker ( 20 August 1876 - March 1962 ) was an English playwright . She earned her living primarily as a typist , and was a spinster until the age of 39 when she married James Allaway , a widower , in June 1915 . By then , she had already written several plays . Baker lived in the west London suburb of Bedford Park , and the constrained lives of the lower middle-class clerical classes was the subject of her first performed play ' ' Chains ' ' . She also wrote ' ' The Price of Thomas Cook ' ' , ' ' Miss Tassey ' ' ( 1910 ) and ' ' Miss Robinson ' ' ( 1918 ) . Like other members of the lower middle class intelligentsia , Baker was a lover of books and the theatre , as well as being a vegetarian and a strict teetotaller . After the end of the Great War , she took off with her husband to the Pacific Ocean , living in Rarotonga in the Cook Islands for two years . They followed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another year in New York . After the death of Allaway in 1941 , Baker moved to Bishop 's Stortford in Hertfordshire where she lived with her stepsister in genteel penury . Her luck changed a few years before her death when ITV televised two of her plays - ' ' Chains ' ' was produced as ' ' Ticket for Tomorrow ' ' in November 1959 , and ' ' Miss Robinson ' ' as ' ' Private and Confidential ' ' in May 1960 . The royalties from these eased her financial situation considerably . Baker was reintroduced to a British audience when ' ' Chains ' ' was staged for the first time in nearly a century by the Orange Tree Theatre in November 2007. 
4702514 Today 's Man ( Ticker : TMAN ) was a retailer chain of Apparel ( men 's wear ) . Today 's Man , Inc. was a chain of men 's apparel stores that operated 25 retail stores in the New York City , Philadelphia , and Washington , D.C. metropolitan areas . They offered a wide selection of low-cost , but good-quality merchandise . The store offered a large selection of suits in the price range between $50 and $200 . In addition to suits , they also sold many other items like shirts , ties , socks , leather jackets and belts . During the 1970s Today 's Man grew steadily , and gradually Today 's Man opened larger and larger stores . About one-third of all its clothing was private label . By 1990 Today 's Man had converted all its existing stores to superstores and sales had reached $100 million . To continue expanding , raise working capital , and pay some debts , Today 's Man became a public corporation in 1992 ( symbol TMAN ) . The stock prospectus described the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 8,000 men 's suits , 3,000 sports coats , 15,000 ties , 15,000 dress shirts , and 10,000 pairs of casual or dress pants . In the early 1990s , as Today 's Man entered the New York City area , it did well financially . Sales continued to increase until 1993 , despite of an overall negative trend in men 's apparel . Starting in 1993 , Today 's Man experienced some real setbacks . By November 1995 the company had reversed its expansion position and began retreating . In early February 1996 the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy . A combination of soft demand for men 's business attire , management 's overambitious plans and mistakes , money problems , and tough competition led to Today 's Man decline . The company continued to downsize and restructure , but did not succeed . They went out of business on April 24 , 2003. 
4707514 genre = Action , strategy ' ' Airheart ' ' is a 1986 video game for the Apple II . It was designed and programmed by Dan Gorlin and published by Brderbund . It requires an Apple IIe enhanced ( or later ) to run , as it uses double hi-res graphics . # Development # Gorlin had great success with his first title , ' ' Choplifter ' ' , which he developed in about six months . This title , however , took about three years to develop . This is in large part because he also developed other games which he lost interest in and never completed and also because he did a lot of research and built a number of tools to help in game development . Gorlin was unable to include all the features he planned . At one point , for example , he had tunnel and underwater levels working , but was unable to complete them due to time constraints . Tunnels and islands , in fact , were key elements of his original vision for the game , but had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gorlin and his team created the largest version of each sprite by hand and then used proprietary tools to create the about twenty smaller versions of the sprite . Storing these sprites in RAM , they were able to simulate scaling in realtime . Though the sprites used a lot of memory , it was the only method that satisfied Gorlin since he hated the low-polygon look of other contemporary games . # Gameplay # The name ' ' Airheart ' ' is the title the player aspires to earn . The user controls a jet-propelled flotation device . They must navigate their craft and fight robotic defenders . Spirit guardians instruct the player to collect certain items , such as a sword or a goblet . Gathering the items is a precursor to a final battle to free an infant boy prince . # Legacy # ' ' Airheart ' ' was a precursor to Gorlin 's later game , ' ' Typhoon Thompson in Search for the Sea Child ' ' for 16-bit computers which is closer to what he originally envisioned for this game .

4724514 Epipubic bones are a pair of bones projecting forward from the pelvic bones of modern marsupials and of some fossil mammals : multituberculates , monotremes , and even basal eutherians ( the ancestors of placental mammals ) . In modern marsupials the epipubic bones are often called marsupial bones because they support the mother 's pouch ( ' ' marsupium ' ' is Latin for pouch ) , but their presence on other groups of mammals indicates that this was not their original function , which some researchers think was to assist locomotion by supporting some of the muscles that flex the thigh . The epipubic bones were first described in 1698 but their functions have remained unresolved . It has been suggested that they form part of a kinetic linkage stretching from the femur on one side to the ribs on the opposite side . This linkage is formed by a series of muscles : each epipubic bone is connected to the femur by the pectineus muscle , and to the ribs and vertebrae by the pyramidalis , rectus abdominis , and external and internal obliques . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levers to stiffen the trunk during locomotion. # See also # * Evolution of mammals * Obturator process * Proximodorsal process 
4725514 Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) also known as ALK tyrosine kinase receptor or CD246 ( cluster of differentiation 246 ) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ' ' ALK ' ' gene . # Function # ALK plays an important role in the development of the brain and exerts its effects on specific neurons in the nervous system . The deduced amino acid sequences reveal that ALK is a novel receptor tyrosine kinase having a putative transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain . These sequences are absent in the product of the transforming NPM-ALK gene . ALK shows the greatest sequence similarity to LTK ( leukocyte tyrosine kinase ) . # Pathology # The ALK gene can be oncogenic in three ways by forming a fusion gene with any of several other genes , by gaining additional gene copies or with mutations of the actual DNA code for the gene itself . # Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma # The 2 ; 5 chromosomal translocation is associated with approximately 60% anaplastic large-cell lymphomas ( ALCLs ) . The translocation creates a fusion gene consisting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nucleophosmin ( NPM ) gene : the 3 ' half of ALK , derived from chromosome 2 and coding for the catalytic domain , is fused to the 5 ' portion of NPM from chromosome 5 . The product of the NPM-ALK fusion gene is oncogenic . In a smaller fraction of ALCL patients , the 3 ' half of ALK is fused to the 5 ' sequence of TPM3 gene , encoding for tropomyosin 3 . In rare cases , ALK is fused to other 5 ' fusion partners , such as TFG , ATIC , CLTC1 , TPM4 , MSN , ALO17 , MYH9. # Adenocarcinoma of the lung # The EML4-ALK fusion gene is responsible for approximately 3-5% of non-small-cell lung cancer(NSCLC) . The vast majority of cases are adenocarcinomas . The standard test used to detect this gene in tumor samples is fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) by a US FDA approved kit . Recently Roche Ventana has got the approval of Chinese FDA and European FDA to test mutation by IHC . Other techniques like reverse-transcriptase PCR ( RT-PCR ) can also be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not recommended . ALK lung cancers are found in patients of all ages , although on average these patients may be somewhat younger . ALK lung cancers are more common in light cigarette smokers or nonsmokers , but a significant number of patients with this disease are current or former cigarette smokers . EML4-ALK-rearrangement in NSCLC is exclusive and not found in EGFR- or KRAS-mutated tumors # Gene rearrangements and overexpression in other tumours # *Familial cases of neuroblastoma *Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor * Adult and pediatric renal cell carcinomas *Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma * Breast cancer , notably the inflammatory subtype * Colonic adenocarcinoma * Glioblastoma multiforme * Anaplastic thyroid cancer # ALK inhibitors # Xalkori ( crizotinib ) , produced by Pfizer , was approved by the FDA for treatment of late stage lung cancer on August 26 , 2011 . Early results of an initial Phase I trial with 82 patients with ALK induced lung cancer showed an overall response rate of 57% , a disease control rate at 8 weeks of 87% and progression free survival at 6 months of 72%.

4772514 ' ' Formica sanguinea ' ' is a species of slave-maker ant . It ranges from Central and Northern Europe through Russia to Japan , China , the Korean Peninsula , and also the United States . This species is colored red and black with workers up to 7 mm long . Its common name comes from their practice of enslaving other species of ants . A colony of ' ' F. sanguinea ' ' can live either by itself or as a social parasite on certain other ' ' Formica ' ' species . In the latter case , a fertilized ' ' F. sanguinea ' ' queen will enter the nest of the host ant species and kill their queen . She then takes advantage of the workers who tend to her and her brood . ' ' F. sanguinea ' ' workers will also raid nearby nests , stealing larvae and pupae to become future workers for ' ' F. sanguinea ' ' .

4951514 PROPAGANDA is a large collection of GPL-licensed seamless desktop backgrounds included in various Linux distributions , and available via free download over the web . While no longer being produced or even officially hosted online , the collection consisted of approximately 15 volumes of largely abstract and surreal art , numbering over 1,000 images in total . Created in GIMP by Bowie J. Poag , the images were meant to attract users to the platform by virtue of the art having been 100% Linux-generated . The style of the images produced by Poag were unusual in terms of their geometric qualities . Appearing to repeat seamlessly along all four edges , PROPAGANDA images became attractive for use in 3D modeling , and particularly for use as desktop wallpaper , in that limitations in graphics hardware at the time often prevented users from using full screen 24-bit images . Using smaller , tileable images for desktop backgrounds helped keep memory utilization to a minimum , while still allowing early Linux desktops to be visually appealing . After ten months , Poag turned control of the project over to Naru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Technology . Although Sundar would subsequently release two additional volumes , Poag terminated the project in April 2000 citing a lack of activity by Sundar , and a falling out with Chris DiBona , a manager of community projects at VA Linux Systems , who provided hosting space for his project . As a side source of amusement , PROPAGANDA 's website featured a satirical storyline that John F. Kennedy had faked his own assassination in 1963 , and had placed himself into cryogenic suspension until the time was right to lead the charge against Microsoft , and help the Linux movement gain footing . While not greatly influential , Poag 's work with PROPAGANDA led many to develop an interest in Linux as a platform during its formative early years .

Although not as well known as Russian , Italian-American , Irish , or Jewish mafias , the Polish mob has a presence in many urban Polish American communities . # Prohibition-era # During Prohibition , many Polish-American criminal gangs took advantage of the opportunity to make money through the illegal sale of alcohol . In Chicago , Joseph Saltis and Jake Guzik allied themselves with Al Capone 's Chicago Outfit . However , fighting Capone was the North Side Gang , which , while mostly Irish-American , had a large Polish presence as well , with leaders Bugs Moran and Hymie Weiss both having a Polish heritage .

Named after the polish word for sausage , the gang is made up of Polish immigrants living in Port Richmond , Kensington , North Philadelphia , Northeast Philly , Bucks County , and South Jersey , as well as second-generation Polish Americans . The gang moved into territory occupied by Irish , Russian , and Italian Mafia outfits , namely the trafficking and dealing of Ecstasy , and are said to have moved into bookmaking and loansharking operations as well .

Led by Ostap Kapelioujnyj and Krzysztof Sprysak , the gang ran its operations of gunrunning , armed robbery , drug trafficking , extortion , car theft , credit card fraud and fencing ( reportedly including a stolen 18th century Stradivarius violin ) mostly in New York City , as well as having connections back in Poland and Eastern Europe .

The first war against organized crime was won by Poland in the 90s . This war was aimed at large gangs . The state triumphed and so we no longer have the gangs of Wolomin and Pruszkow , said Mr Bartomiej Sienkiewicz at the press conference at the MI . Head of the MI added that at the moment there were about 200 criminal groups operating across Poland which were under constant police monitoring . For none of them the situation is likely to return to the one observed in the 90s said Minister Bartomiej Sienkiewicz . Polish organized crime majorly emerged in the 1990s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only partly in thanks to the at that time rising corruption . Nowadays Polish organized crime groups are well known for operating sophisticated car theft-rings , as well as for their involvement in drug trafficking ( the main drug being methamphetamine ) and weapon trafficking . # Pruszkw mob # The ' ' Pruszkw mafia ' ' is the name given to the organized criminal group that emerged from the suburb of Pruszkw in the beginning of the 1990s . The group is known for being involved in large car-theft rings , drug trafficking ( including cocaine , heroin , hashish and methamphetamine ) , kidnapping , extortion , weapon trafficking ( including AK-47 's ) and murder . Even though law enforcement dealt a severe blow to the ' ' Pruszkw mafia ' ' , it is alleged that Pruszkw-based gangs , with or without notice from their former leaders , have regained their strength in recent years and have began setting up their car-theft rings and connections with Colombian drug cartels again .

5182514 Goscelin of Saint-Bertin ( or Goscelin of Canterbury ) was a Benedictine hagiographical writer . His date of birth is unknown , but it can not have been later than the early 1040s . He was a Fleming or Brabantian by birth and became a monk of St Bertin 's at Saint-Omer before travelling to England to take up a position in the household of Herman , Bishop of Ramsbury ( 1058-78 ) . During his time in England , he stayed at many monasteries and wherever he went collected materials for his numerous hagiographies of English saints . # Life # # Flanders # According to William of Malmesbury , Goscelin was a monk of St Bertin 's . On the other hand , as the author of the ' ' Vita Amalbergae virginis ' ' , written before 1062 , Goscelin appears to be very well informed about the hagiographic tradition in Flanders and Brabant , more especially traditions related to Saint Peter 's Abbey of Ghent . He probably stayed there at some time before 1062. # England # According to William of Malmesbury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who arrived in 1058 . But , William of Malmesbury mistakenly claims that this was the year in which Herman became bishop of Sherborne , an appointment he did not take up until the death of Sherborne 's resident bishop AElfwold in 1062-65 . It is doubtful , therefore , that his information about Goscelin 's arrival is reliable . In fact , Goscelin states , himself , in his ' ' Liber confortatorius ' ' , that ' he first came to the bishop ' at Potterne or Canning ( in Wiltshire ) , implying that he did not travel to England in his company , but joined him there instead . It used to be thought that he arrived before the Norman Conquest , but there is no evidence for this supposition , although it is possible . Goscelin 's patron and companion was Herman , Bishop of Sherborne . He functioned as secretary to the bishop and as chaplain to the nuns of Wilton Abbey . His fortunes took a turn for the worse when Bishop Herman died in 1078 and was succeeded by Osmund of Ses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' describes as a king who knew not Joseph . In the early 1080s , he was at Peterborough . Later , he wrote hagiography for the monastic communities of Ely , Barking , Ramsey , and St Augustine 's , Canterbury , among other places . # Writing # William of Malmesbury praises his industry in the highest terms . He was at Ely about 1082 , where he wrote a life of St thelthryth . Between 1087 and 1091 he was at Ramsey , and compiled there a life of the abbot St Ivo , or Ives . In the 1090s , he went to Canterbury , where he wrote his account of the translation of the relics of St Augustine and his companions , which had taken place in 1091 . He wrote it in the octave year after that event , i.e. in 1098-99 , and dedicated the work to St Anselm . A Canterbury obituary , quoted by Henry Wharton in ' ' Anglia Sacra ' ' , gives 15 May as the day of death of a certain Goscelin , who may have been this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still alive in 1106 , when he wrote an account of the translation of St Wihtburh , of Ely His works consist of the lives of many English saints , chiefly of those connected with Canterbury , where he spent his last years . Some of them have been printed by the Bollandists , by Jean Mabillon , and by Jacques-Paul Migne . Others are contained in manuscripts in the British Museum and at Cambridge . His chief work was a life of St Augustine of Canterbury , professing to be based on older records and divided into two parts , -- an Historia major ( Mabillon , ' ' Acta Sactorum ' ' . O.S.B. , I ) and an Historia minor ( in Wharton , ' ' Anglia Sacra ' ' , I ) .

5396514 tracklength = el = No elevation = The HolmestrandVittingfoss Line ( ) or HVB is an abandoned railway between Holmestrand to Hvittingfoss in Norway . It consisted of two sections : a 13.4 km line from Holmestrand to Hillestad and a 10.4 km section from Hof to Hvittingfoss . The two parts were connected by a 6km 0 section of the TnsbergEidsfoss Line . At Holmestrand Station , the line connected to the Vestfold Line of the Norwegian State Railways . HVB was opened on 30 September 1902 and closed on 1 June 1938 . The main purpose of the line was the transport of wood pulp at Hvittingfoss , although it was also used for passenger transport until 1931. # Route # The narrow gauge railway executed a steep climb from Holmestrand to Hvittingfoss . It had a maximum gradient of 2.5 percent , a minimum curve radius of and a track weight of 17.5 kg/m . At Holmestrand , the line followed a zig-zap pattern up the hill , forcing the trains to back into Holmestand Station . Located up from Holmestrand is a the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line is 13.4 km . There , it runs concurrently with the TnsbergEidsfoss Line for 6km 0 , before splitting again at Hof and running 10.4 km to Hvittingfoss . In Holmestrand there was a spur to Nordisk Aluminium , which remained in use as a branch of the Vestfold Line until 1984 . In Holmestrand , the locomotive shed is still in use , although urban growth has removed all other remains of the line . The right-of-way out of town is used as a suburban street . The tunnel has fallen into disuse , but from there the right-of-way is used as a trail . Towards Hillestad the railway ran in agricultural land , which has been reclaimed . The last few kilometers towards Hillestad , the route is used as a forestry road . From Hof , the right-of-way is gone , but along the last section down to Hvittingfoss , the right-of-way remains as a forestry road . The station and freight house have been preserved . # History # # Planning # Proposals for a Vestfold Line arose in the late 1860s and accelerated through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should run , with three major proposals : along the shore of the Oslofjord , along Eikeren to Eidsfoss and through an inland route to Tnsberg , and via Lgendalen to Larvik . The Eidsfoss alternative allowed the line to run through an area with good access to lumber , which the railway would aid export . The main disadvantage was that the route was 20 km longer than via the coast . Other minor plans included a Svarstad Line which would have run from Horten via Skoppum and Svarstad to Hvittingfoss . It was mostly seen as a supplement to the Lgendal Line , should it have been built . The issue was not resolved until Parliament on 8 June 1875 voted in favor of a coastal route . The narrow gauge Vestfold Line , at the time named the Jarlsberg Line , opened in 1881 . Engineer C. F. Melby proposed during the 1890s that the Svarstad Line be built . It was proposed to branch from the Vestfold Line at Skoppum Station , the same station the Horten Line branches from . It was proposed as a minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it being designed with sharp curves and steep gradients . The basis at Skoppum allowed the shortest distance to a coastal station . The line was proposed run along Undrumsdal , Fosaas , through Fossan , Firing , Holt , Sjuve , Vivestad and Vasss before reaching Svarstad . IT would then have run north through Lgendalen to Hvittingfoss . This gave a not too complicated construction , allowing costs to be low . The line received support in Horten , and with a single decisive vote the municipal council voted in favor of a NOK 150,000 grant of the total NOK 1.4 million in estimated construction cots . However , it met little support in other political bodies and was soon scrapped . Instead a shorter line from Holmestrand to Hvittingfoss was favored . The main incentive to build a railway was caused by Vittingfoss Brug . The pulp mill had been established by Andrers Olai Handeborg in 1872 . Although located in a good location in relation to power and access to lumber , its interior location made transport of the pulp difficult . It bought a steam tractor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to use and it was soon abandoned . The company therefore started arguing that it needed a railway . Handeborg lost omost of his fortune in the stock market crash of 1899 and the mill was taken over by the banks . In 1902 they sold it to the British publisher Edward Lloyd and the company took the name Vittingfoss Bruk . Demands for a railway to Hvittingfoss came as a response to the planning of the TnsbergEidsfoss Line . From the point of view of interests from Holmestrand , they were worried that the town would lose its surrounding area to Tnsberg , and hence its basis for trade . A committee was created , consisting of Birch , N. G. Berg and Chr . Bettum . They concluded that they railway should be built as cheap as possible , and proposed that 750 millimeter ( 2 ft in ) gauge be used . This would cause a break of gauge in Holmestrand , but the committee argued that nearly all traffic would be transferred to boats at Holmestrand , so this would not incur much costs . Hvittingfoss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares forth NOK 100,000 if this was chosen . The committee further proposed shortening the line by building part of it as a rack railway , allowing for steeper gradients. # Construction # The railway was approved by Parliament on 24 July 1896 , at the same time as the TnsbergEidsfoss Line . The original budget was NOK 728,000 . The line was to be built and operated as a private railway . Construction of the TnsbergEidsfoss Line commenced in 1898 , and this line was built with , the same as the Vestfold Line . Because HVB desired to have the same gauge as TEB to allow for a concurrency , HVB 's gauge was therefore changed to gauge . The alternative was to build the section with dual gauge . The issue resulted in disagreements between the parties , but in the end the pulp mill agreed to maintain their financing despite the gauge change . A proposal to electrify the railway was proposed , but the NOK 250,000 cost was not found to pay off and therefore scrapped . The line was surveyed twice , with the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternatives could be chosen along the common section with TEB , with a line via stbygden being discarded in favor of one north of Hillestadvannet . There was during the late planning stages a proposal to increase the minimum curve radius from 100to150 m , but this was discarded after the government would not allocate the additional necessary funding . One of the major delays during construction was the Innlofjellet Tunnel , which suffered several landslides , one which partially flooded the town . Five alternatives were proposed in Holmestrand , which variously included sharing NSB 's Holmestrand Station or building a separate station . The municipal council supported on 20 November 1900 an alternative with a separate station at the towns square , with a branch via Gausen to NSB 's station . Estimated to cost NOK 43,000 , this was the cheapest alternative . NSB opposed this , stating that it could cause operational problems for them at Holmestrand Station , but gave permission for the connection line on 26 August 1902 . Laying of the permanent way started on 28 September 1901 . The construction cost ended at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rest was paid for by municipalities and private individuals and companies . With the increase to gauge , a further NOK 100,000 was granted on 28 March 1896 . The state increased its investments twice more as costs continued to increase , based on decisions in Parliament for a raise of NOK 74,000 on 29 May 1900 and a raise of NOK 30,000 on 20 May 1902 . These increased fundings were met with equal increased local funding . A fatal accident occurred on 1 October 1902 , when the final inspection was being carried out . The inspector had not been informed of an extra maintenance of way train , and he was run down while on the tracks . The official opening took place the following day , on 2 October 1902. # Early operational history # HVB and TEB signed an agreement concerning the operation of the concurrent section . TEB was given the operational responsibility , although both railways were free to use it . All transshipment was to take place at Hillestad Station . Both companies retained their revenue , while HVB compensated TEB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included that the two lines would share a sixth of TEB 's administration costs , based jointly on the number of trains and the revenue from the concurrent section . Any upgrades to the section would be split between the two companies . Operational costs were split based on the ration of the number of trains and the number of axles . If the two companies could not agree on the calculation , NSB 's district chief in Drammen would arbitrate . HVB bought t is first two steam locomotives from Krauss &amp; Co. of Germany . They were numbered 1 and 2 , and named ' ' Holmestrand ' ' and ' ' Vittingfoss ' ' . The company also bought three two-axle passenger cars and twenty-four freight cars . In 1902 , ' ' Holmestrand ' ' was sold to TEB , because they had problems with their locomotives . The railway bought three passenger carriages , one which also had a second class compartment . Although it had a standard almost comparable to NSB 's first class , it saw little use and nearly all passengers traveled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interior . On the one hand it provided a fast and efficient way to reach the coastal towns , but many farmers lost and important supplementary income after they were no longer needed to perform transport services for Vittingfoss Bruk . The first full operation year , in 1903 , resulted in 19,446 passengers and a profit of NOK 1,556.71 . The following year ridership increased dramatically , to 45,418 . Also freight increased , from 10,887 to 25,820 tonnes . This caused additional rolling stock to be procured . New freight cars were built at Eidsfoss Verk and a new locomotive was built by Thune . Delivered in October 1904 , it was also named ' ' Holmestrand ' ' , and was identical to a class being built for the Lier Line . Thune delivered the railway 's fourth locomotive in 1909 . By then the railway had 53 freight cars . The company had a profit of NOK 29,714 in 1910 . Transshipment between HVB and NSB initially cost HVB NOK 38.25 per car . The track arrangement from Gausen to Holmestrand Station caused operational difficulties for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new section also served Nordisk Aluminium . In 1907 HVB transshipped 114 tonnes of express cargo and 13,553 tonnes of regular cargo to NSB . HVB 's cars drove a combined 8042km sp=us on NSB lines . The annual amounts varied , with the express cargo following to 20 tonnes and regular cargo 878 tonnes by 1911 . Then traffic rose , reaching 140 and 5,600 tonnes , respectively , in 1920 . A peak cargo of 73,196 tonnes was transported in 1915 . Although HVB was profitable , TEB failed after the initial years to make money on its operation . There therefore arose a proposal for HVB to take over all operations north of Hillestad , and relegate the southern part of TEB to a suburban line for Tnsberg . The proposal came from the HVB 's board , who saw the possibility of using existing crew and rolling stock to operate trains from Eidsfoss to Holmestrand . It would have increased the number of daily services from Hillestad to Holmestrand from two to four . The proposals was rejected by the municipal councils in Tnsberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEB . The passenger transport from Hvittingfoss increased until the 1910s , when it stabilized at about 50,000 passengers per year , before peaking at 90,910 in 1918 . However , high coal prices drew up operating costs , even though the railway in part started using wood as fuel . The company had a deficit of NOK 30,293 in 1918 . The next two years the ridership fell by a third , while the company 's costs for fuel increased to NOK 80,424 to NOK 156,540 . The company went with a loss until 1923 , when traffic started increasing again . The highest profit , of NOK 61,602 , was recorded in 1925 . The following year Hasestad Station burned down in a fire , and the wharfs in Holmestrand collapsed because it could not support the amount of pulp being stored there . Freight traffic continued to fall in the following years . Patronage until the late 1920s , when between 20,000 and 30,000 passengers per year were transported . A bus service through Lgendalen started in 1910 , providing services from Vittingfoss to Kongsberg and Larvik . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in part as a compensation for the valley not receiving a railway . The responsibility was given to NSB , who 's bus division started a route from Larvik via Svarstad to Kongsberg . The main challenge was finding a suitable vehicle to operate the service during winter . The service included one daily route to Vittingfoss , which corresponded with the train . The route was not favorable for the railway company . The bus service gave little new traffic to the railway , while the railway fed considerable traffic to the bus service , although few passengers transferred between the two . # Termination of passenger services # All services on the line were mix trains , which resulted in long stops at station to load and unload cargo . Trains would be delayed , causing passengers to instead ride with unscheduled buses . HVB cosidered buying a railcar , and borrowed one from NSB , but found it was not powerful enough to get up the steep gradients . Instead the company bought a bus in 1925 , which was to operate a single daily round service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficit was increasing . The state guaranteed for NOK 18,000 , but demanded that the remaining loss be covered by the municipalities . Costs were proposed cut by closing the workshop in Holmestrand . HVB attempted to secure a deal with NSB in which the latter would effectively subsidize the maintenance , but this was rejected by NSB . The result was that a few jobs were cut in Holmestrand and maintenance continued as before . Additional cost savings were carried out by reducing maintenance of the track to a bare minimum . HVB experienced a sharp increase of ridership to 51,442 in 1928 , just to see it fall down to 25,000 the following year and to 21,157 in 1930 . HVB attempted to increase their traffic by reducing their fares , both for passengers and freight . The company also experienced that many shippers overloaded the cars . In addition to the loss of revenue , if the car was to continue with NSB , it was often required to be transshipped , at the cost of HVB . This was particularly a problem with lumber . An easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not resolved until it was discovered that a correctly loaded car would just allow a match box to fit between the car 's frame and bogie spring . The company therefore announced on 27 January 1931 that it intended to terminate all passenger trains from 1 March . This would give cost savings of NOK 30,000 , as all employees who worked with expedition of passengers could be laid off , reducing the number of employees at intermediate stations from thirty to seven . The company would expand its bus service , which it expected to make a profit from . The trains could be optimized for freight timetables , giving additional cost savings . The bus was not delivered until September , postponing the termination of passenger operations to 27 September . The company was able to make a profit of NOK 157 in 1932 . The closing of the passenger train service received mixed reactions . On the one hand it was possible to reach Holmestrand up to an hour earlier , but on the other hand the ride was much less comfortable . This was in part caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter than the railway , as it could allow for steeper climbs . From 1932 Vittingfoss Bruk started a harder line in their negotiations with the railway . They contracted part of the pulp freighting to truck drivers , and demanded discounts from the railway company . This caused HVB to make a NOK 5,000 loss that year . The following year Vittingfoss Bruk stopped sending any cargo with HVB , which had a dramatic effect on HVB . The company 's board started intense negotiations to find new sources of revenue or areas to cut costs , and proposed both closing down the line and a merger with TEB. # Merger and closing # NSB carried out a survey to look into the future of HVB and TEB . The report recommended that borth the branch from Eidsfoss and Hvittingfoss run to Holmestrand and that the section from Hillestad to Tnsberg . By then Hvittingfoss Bruk had been bought by Tnsberg Municipality , and to retain the transshipment jobs at the town 's port , the municipal council insisted on that the pulp mill send its pulp to Tnsberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was met with resistance in Holmestrand , as an estimated 44 people would lose their jobs and Viking Melk would possibly have to close down . To rationalize operations , HVB and TEB were merged on 23 August 1934 through the creation of a new railway company , Vestfold Privatbaner . Holmestrand protested against the head office being located in Tnsberg and decided to not buy shares in the company . This further relegated their influence over the line and operations . Vestfold Privatbaner had a troubled economy , as Vittingfoss Bruk repeatedly shut down production . The railway company 's director thus in 1936 started the process of closing the segment from Hillestad to Holmestrand , and from 1936 only irregular trains ran on the segment . A youth fair resulted in a several charter trains being run on 13 June 1937 . The final revenue train was a series of half-completed freight trains which were being built by Eidsfoss Verk . Because of the uncertain future of the line , they decided to transfer production to Sundland in Drammen and the unfinished cars were sent via HVB. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1967 with the intension of establishing a heritage railway .

One person offered to donate two carriages , with original interior and coloring , but after a building permit was rejected he instead chose to burn them down . A representative traveled to Sweden , where he was able to purchase narrow-gauge rolling stock . Clearing of the line at Hillestad started in May 1968 and station building at Kleppen was attempted transported up to Hillestad . However , the truck carrying the building had an accident and the building was smashed . The heritage enthusiasm died out .

The Ruska Romani language contains some German , Polish , and Russian words , as well as a small amount of Ukrainian and Russian grammar . Most Ruska Roma are Orthodox Christians , while those living in predominantly Muslim areas ( such as the Caucasus ) tend to be Muslim . Their traditional professions are horse trading , music , dancing , and fortune-telling . Today , most Romani singers , actors , dancers , and musicians in Russia are of the Ruska Roma .

They were considered to be so talented that their owners emancipated them . Romani choruses of Moscow and Saint-Petersburg were very popular during the 19th century . Russian noblemen sometimes married Romani chorus girls . In Russia , Ruska Roma were mostly nomadic horse traders and singers . They traveled during the summer and stayed in cottages of Russian peasants during the winter . They paid for their lodging with money or with work on the horses . Ruska Roma were very popular among peasants who liked their music and dances and considered Roma to be beautiful . In 1812 , when Napoleon I invaded Russia , the Romani diaspora of Moscow and Saint Petersburg gave large sums of money and good horses for the Russian army .

Romani literature and press appeared ; most of the poets , writers and journalists were from the Ruska Roma . In the 1930s the Roma of the U.S.S.R. were subjected to mass repressions . Romani press and literature were forbidden . During World War II some of the Ruska Roma entered the army , by conscription and as volunteers . They took part in the war as soldiers , officers , infantrymen , tankmen , artillerymen , aviators , drivers , paramedics and doctors . Some teenagers , old men and adult men were also partisans .

Following his degree studies , he became assistant to George Hardie ( 19781979 ) and then shared a studio with designer Neville Brody at The Face magazine ( 19791981 and 19901996 ) . In 1981 , Ian Wright set up his own studio . Wrights work as a commercial illustrator has spanned four decades , starting with his illustrative cover of The Undertones Teenage Kicks 7 single in the late 1970s , progressing with his illustrative artwork in The Face magazine in their 1980s heyday ( which was the perfect outlet for his artwork combining cutting edge elements of fashion , style and music ) and his famous weekly black and white portraits for the New Musical Express ( NME ) . Mr. Wrights subsequent work has involved collaboration with many famous names . His illustrative career has included working on projects for such famous , and diverse , names as Issey Miyake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pete Townshend , Tony Bennett , T.I. and many others . Ian Wrights creative approach to illustration has resulted in a fresh and constant updating of his work into new creative directions , including testing new developments in technology and mixing up techniques and materials , whilst creating unique artistic visions . His work today expands upon his early illustrations while maintaining the integrity of his early investigations . An early portrait of Grandmaster Flash was made entirely with salt to replicate cocaine as a reference to the seminal rap track , White Lines . He adopted photocopiers at an early stage creating illustrative images by changing single color toners within the machine to mimic the screen print process ; building layers of color from separate artworks into one final image . His portraits and illustrative artwork for record sleeves and the music press have allowed Mr. Wright the luxury to slip effortlessly between the analogue and the digital .
