4514 A dodecapharmacum is a medicine of twelve ingredients . The best known was the Apostles ' Ointment ( Latin : Apostolorum unguentum ) , or Ointment of Venus ( Latin : ' ' unguentum Veneris ' ' ) which was an ointment attributed to Avicenna ( d.1037 ) made of twelve ingredients . The ingredients were turpentine , wax , gum ammoniac , birthwort roots , olibanum , bdellium , myrrh and galbanum , opoponax , verdigris , litharge , plus olive oil , and vinegar . Avicenna describes the ingredients and proportions of such a recipe in Qanun V.1.11 . Some later writers have questioned whether the title of the recipe Ointment of the Apostles , or Ointment of Venus were used by Avicenna himself , however when an Arabic version of the Canon of Medicine ( ) was first printed in 1593 in Rome , recipe no. 442 ( Arabic ) was entitled ointment of the Apostles ( Arabic : ' ' marham ur rusul ' ' ) . The name Ointment of the Apostles for the 12-ingredient recipe appears in the works of the Dominican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inventarium sive chirugia magna ' ' of Guy de Chauliac ( 1330s ) . Renaissance pharmacy texts such as the ' ' Antidotarium Romanum ' ' ( Rome , 1590 ) also include the recipe as ' ' Unguentem Apostolorum ' ' . The Arabic equivalent of the Latin ' ' Unguentum Apostolorum ' ' is found in later Arabic medical texts such as the translations into Arabic of the Nestorian Christian physician David of Antioch ( d.1596 ) . Naming of the ointment of the Apostles as ointment of Venus occurs in the works of Jehan Yperman ( c.1260-c.1330 ) . However many remedies were called .. of Venus and also widely known in antiquity was an eye-salve called the plaster of Isis distinct from later Ointment of Venus . Mirza Ghulam Ahmad ( Urdu 1899 ) claimed that this ointment was known as the Ointment of Jesus ( Arabic : marham-i-Isa ) and had helped Jesus recover from the wounds of crucifixion , in support of his claim that Jesus did not die upon the Cross and was saved .

4 birthplace = Paris Alain Kirili ( born in 1946 ) is a French sculptor . He is recognized for his post-minimalist abstract sculptures in forged iron and his large-scale public sculptures . His work has subsequently been the subject of numerous gallery and museum exhibitions in America and Europe , and has received considerable critical interest from art historians , such as Thierry Dufrne , Robert C. Morgan , Robert Rosenblum , and Kirk Varnedoe . Alain Kirili lives and works in Paris and New York . # Early career # Alain Kirili was born to a French family in Paris . At the age of 19 , during the course of his early artistic training , Kirili discovered sculptures ' ' Cubi XVIII ' ' and ' ' Cubi XIX ' ' , exhibited at the Muse Rodin in Paris and was immediately inspired by the American sculptor 's work . Kirili traveled to the United States that same year . During his stay , Kirili visited the major museum collections in New York , Washington , Baltimore , Philadelphia , Chicago , and Detroit , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became an especially influential figure to him . Alain Kirili met 1966 the Korean painter ( 1904-1989 ) in Paris . During this period , Kirili became part of the circle of intellectuals , writers and artists around Roland Barthes and the avant-garde literary magazine Tel Quel , Philippe Sollers and Julia Kristeva . His first solo show was at Sonnabend Gallery in Paris in 1972 . Among other works , this show included a floor piece ( ' ' Untitled ' ' , 1972 ; cut zinc sheet ) which already contained many of the elements that would characterize his future practice . This work is reproduced in the exhibition catalog , and accompanied with a text by the French poet and art critic Marcelin Pleynet . Ileana Sonnabend introduced Kirili to Robert Rauschenberg , whom he credits with introducing him to important personalities in the New York art scene .

In 1978 while traveling in India for the first time , Kirili was inspired by the Hindu concept of Yoni / Lingam , a sculptural representation of the feminine ( Yoni ) and the masculine ( Lingam ) forming a symbolic union in the manner of base and sculpture in Kirilis work . In his article , ' ' Lingaistics ' ' published in Art in America in 1982 , Kirili evokes more specifically the sexual and repetitive aspect of these abstract and highly symbolic religious objects . Kirili 's first solo show in New York ( 1978 ) was held at Sonnabend Gallery where he exhibited a series of forged iron sculptures . In 1979 , the Museum of Modern Art ( MoMA ) acquired one of his pieces ( ' ' Indian Curve ' ' , 1976 ) for the first time , the acquisition coinciding with his move to New York . # Oeuvre # # Early sculpture in forged iron # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kirilis earliest forged iron pieces ; it consists in a thinly shaped iron bar growing out of its base in modeled bronze . The tactile and spiritual quality of the sculpture distinguishes it from then-prevailing tendencies in Conceptual art . Art historian Robert Rosenblum perceived in this work a vertical force , familiar in the paintings of Barnett Newman , suggesting a spiritually rather than materially assertive human presence . The concept of verticality is indeed crucial in the context of Kirili 's oeuvre . In an interview with art critic Philippe Piguet , Kirili addresses furthermore the importance he ascribes to the concepts of circumvolution and incarnation . One of his early sculptures was shown at the Institute for Art and Urban Resources ( now MoMA PS1 ) in 1976 . Others , e.g. ' ' Untitled ' ' ( 1978 ) and ' ' Laocoon II ' ' ( 1978 ) , both representative of this first series in forged iron , are now in the Nasher collection , Dallas , and the Fonds National dart contemporain ( FNAC ) , France , respectively . Other early sculptures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) explore the upward movement of a curved metal bar seeking support on a wall , as well as the potentials of a horizontal rather than vertical extension ( e.g. ' ' Longevity ' ' , 1980 ) . Kirili once described his aesthetic as organic simplicity in the tradition of , but formally not attached to , minimalism and abstract expressionism . Indeed , his early sculptures are already concerned with tactility and gesture , emphasizing the active involvement of the artists hand in the process of creation . Kirili embraces a process that is immediate , combining emotions , intuitions , and the subconscious , in a free improvisation with the material . # ' ' Commandement ' ' series # The ' ' Commandement ' ' series of sculptures is one of Kirilis most important and ongoing bodies of work . This series of distinct geometric forms , which art historians have described as mystical fonts and abstract alphabets , rises 15 to 35 inches above the ground and individual examples are composed of up to 90 elements . According to Kirili 's statement , the title ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jewish Museum in New York . He came across the word Rimonim and was told that , in Hebrew , it referred to the pomegranate fruit and , by extension , to the Commandments in the Torah , which are said to be as numerous as the seeds in a pomegranate . The forms of the elements in the ' ' Commandements ' ' series were influenced by his encounter , on New York 's Lower East Side , with the Torah calligraphers who trace their letters in the tradition of stone engravers . This series is concerned with the symbolic value of basic forms , and particularly with the world of glyphs , signs , and texts , in a way that evokes not only Kirili 's fascination with ancient scripture , but also his ties to the Parisian milieu of writers and intellectuals such as Roland Barthes , Philippe Sollers , and Julia Kristeva . **6;84291;br In 1992 , Soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy , performed in and amongst Kirili 's ' ' Commandement ' ' at New York 's Thread Waxing Space , launching an ongoing series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of these improvisations , for example with Billy Bang , Thomas Buckner , Roy Campbell , Jr. , Roy Haynes , Steve Lacy , Sunny Murray , William Parker , Joe McPhee , Cecil Taylor , among others , are documented in ' ' Celebrations ' ' published in 1997 by Christian Bourgois , Paris . The earliest ' ' Commandements ' ' were created out of iron and either forged or cut with a torch . Kirili continued this series with a variety of materials , including styrofoam , painted iron , and pigmented concrete . Kirili first experimented with pigmented concrete in ' ' Commandement , Claude Monet ' ' , which was shown at the Muse de lOrangerie , Paris ( 2007 ) as part of the exhibition ' ' Kirili et les Nymphas ' ' . **6;84299;br ' ' Rythmes d'Automne ' ' ( 2012 ) , the most recent of the ' ' Commandements ' ' , was commissioned by the City of Paris and exhibited on the parvis of the Htel de Ville in the heart of Paris . ' ' Rythmes d'Automne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey , pigmented concrete , invites the public into its 6,500 square feet wide space of signs in order to play , converse , dance , or meditate. # A dialogue between variety and unity # Kirili has constantly pursued an interest in abstract modeling , which has resulted over the years in the creation of an entire body of work in terra cotta . Art historian Kirk Varnedoe describes these works as heavily manipulated and often in rich fleshy tones , invested with more feminine form and with an altogether different energy , especially compared to his forged iron pieces . In 1978 Kirili began including iron elements and especially iron wire in the terra cotta pieces ( ' ' Adam ' ' , 1978 ) . The first terra cotta series was presented in two consecutive exhibitions , along with Kirili 's forged iron pieces , at Galerie Maeght in Paris in 1984 and 1985 , including the series ' ' Ivresse ' ' , now in the collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou . In 1985 Kirili was invited to exhibit at the Muse Rodin . Kirili has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodins oeuvre , as these forces resonate in a more abstract manner in Kirili 's own work . He has also written about Rodins erotic drawings in Rodin , Dessins rotiques , published by Editions Gallimard in 1987 . ' ' Nudity ' ' ( 1985 ) , modeled in clay and cast in bronze , was created for this show and is Kirilis first monumental ( almost 7 feet tall ) bronze . Its surface is densely modeled and insistently abstract , but nonetheless displays the pleasure of rendering human flesh as art historian Paula Rand Hornbostel put it . Kirili simultaneously presented a group of new sculptures-tables , table like sculptures , entitled ' ' Gnrations ' ' . Initiated in 1984 , ' ' Gnrations ' ' as Kirk Varnedoe suggests brings together a complex array of individual smaller sculptures pieces from the ' Commandment ' series , and forged-iron works of various scales in an approach of formal unity . ' ' Gnrations ' ' with their lively tempo and bright openness explore a dialogue between heterogeneous forms and media , between variety and unity . Kirili @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1986 , to experiment with aluminum . While applying a torch to the aluminum , Kirili discovered the material 's explosive reaction . This explosion , which resembled a floral mechanism , was perceived by Kirili as a very expressionistic and emotional sign , which emerged from the regularity of the vertical . Art critic Philippe Dagen emphasized the velvetiness and metallicness of these aluminum pieces in his essay for the catalog of Kirilis solo exhibition at the Muse dart moderne de Sainte-Etienne where he presented several of these sculptures , e.g. ' ' King I ' ' ( 1986 ) and ' ' Symphonie des Psaumes ' ' ( 1988 ) . From 2008 on , Kirili has devoted himself to the creation of several series of organic wire sculpture , with partial rubber inclusions , in different colors , which he conceptualizes as three-dimensional drawings . The process of creation is based on velocity and free improvisation , similar to Kirili 's technique of modeling clay . His series ' ' Aria ' ' ( 2012 ) was created between his studios in New York and Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a select number of Hartung 's sculptures . This show was presented in two parts , at the Foundation Hartung Bergman and the Muse Picasso ( Antibes ) in 2012/2013. # Large-scale Public sculpture # Art historian Kirk Varnedoe points out that Scale is of crucial concern to Kirili , and a general tendency toward greater scale has ( like a growing interest in the special conditions of outdoor sculpture ) been characteristic of his recent work . **6;84307;br Kirili considers ' ' Grand Commandement Blanc ' ' ( 1986 ; Tuileries Garden , Paris ) as his first large-scale public sculpture . In 1992 , he initiated a series of large-scale limestone sculptures of which ' ' Rsistance ' ' ( 2011 ) is the most recent one . The title is inspired by a maxim of the French Resistance which he adopted : Creation is an act of resistance and resistance is an act of creation . Commissioned by the city of Grenoble , ' ' Rsistance ' ' is composed of seven binary elements of giant Burgundy limestone blocks . Each element is approximately 8 <sup> 1 </sup> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 <sup> 1 </sup> / <sub> 2 </sub> feet wide . Two other similar sculptures , both commissions , are permanently installed in France : ' ' Improvisation ( Tellem ) ' ' , 2000 , in Dijon ( campus of the University of Burgundy ) and ' ' Hommage Charlie Parker ' ' , 2007 , in Paris ( Avenue de France ) . **6;84315;br Art historian Thierry Dufrne characterized this series as giant drippings because of their scale and the spontaneous and their rapid on-site installation , which is accomplished without any preliminary drawings . The gesture is monumental , spontaneous , free , and rapid . # Exhibitions ( selection ) # Alain Kirili has exhibited widely in America and Europe . His sculptures have been presented in numerous museum exhibitions , including : Institute of Art and Urban Resources , PS1 ( 1976 ) , Museum Haus Lange , Krefeld ( 1978 ) , Dallas Museum of Art , Dallas ( 1981 ) , Frankfurter Kunstverein , Francfort ( 1982 ) , Muse Rodin , Paris ( 1985 ) , Brooklyn Museum , New York ( 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , IVAM , Valencia ( 2003 ) , Muse d'Orsay , Paris ( 2006 ) , Muse de l'Orangerie , Paris ( 2007 ) , and Muse des Beaux-Arts de Caen ( 2013 ) . **6;84323;br He has also exhibited in private galleries , including : Sonnabend Gallery Paris , Geneva , New York ( 1972-1982 ) , Galerie Beyeler , Basel ( 1980 ) , Galerie Adrien Maeght , Paris ( 1984 , 1985 ) , Holly Solomon Gallery , New York ( 1987 , 1990 ) , Galerie Templon , Paris ( 1989-1996 ) , Marlborough Gallery , New York ( 1998-2000 ) , Galerie Akira Ikeda , New York , Berlin , Tokyo ( 2012 , 2013 ) , and Galerie Pice Unique , Paris ( 2013 ) . **6;84331;br Whereas several of these shows were conceived as dialogues with historical artists ( e.g. Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux , Auguste Rodin , Claude Monet , among others ) , his work has also been exhibited in group or two person shows with more contemporary artists , notably with Larry Bell , John Chamberlain , Ron Gorchov , Mark di Suvero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # Image gallery # <gallery> Image:1976 AK Untitled 130x130cm shot1 web.jpg ' ' Sans titre ' ' ( 1976 ) Image:1977 AK Untitled 410cm shot1 web.jpg ' ' Sans titre ' ' ( 1977 ) Image:AK Adam credit003.jpg ' ' Adam ' ' ( 1978 ) Image:AK nudite ii006.jpg ' ' Nudit ' ' ( 1985 ) **25;84339;TOOLONG ' ' Symphonie ' ' ( 1988 ) Image:V 1988 AK oratorio.jpg ' ' Oratorio ' ' ( 1988 ) Image:AK Generations004.jpg ' ' Gnrations ' ' ( 1989 ) **31;84366;TOOLONG ' ' Commandement II ' ' ( 1991 ) </gallery> # Commissions # * 1986 ' ' Grand Commandement Blanc ' ' , Tuileries garden , Paris * 1995 ' ' Black Sound ' ' , Art OMI , International Arts Center , Ghent , NY * 1998 ' ' Water Letters ' ' , Muse de Grenoble , Grenoble * 2000 ' ' Improvisation ( Tellem ) ' ' , University of Burgundy , Dijon ( permanently installed ) * 2002 ' ' Ascension ' ' , Abbaye de Montmajour , Arles * 2007 ' ' Hommage Charlie Parker ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) * 2011 ' ' Rsistance ' ' , Grenoble ( permanently installed ) * 2011 ' ' Geste de Rsistance ' ' , Caen * 2012 ' ' Rythmes dAutomne ' ' , Paris # Collections ( selection ) # # United States # * Museum of Modern Art ( New York , NY ) * The Morgan Library &amp; Museum ( New York , NY ) * Jewish Museum ( New York , NY ) * Albright , Knox Art Gallery ( Buffalo , NY ) * Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art ( Ridgefield , CT ) * Vogel Collection , Museum of Art Rhode Island School of Design ( Providence , RI ) * New Mexico Museum of Art ( Santa Fe , NM ) * Dallas Museum of Art ( Dallas , TX ) * Nasher Fondation ( Dallas , TX ) . # France # * Centre Georges Pompidou / Muse National d'Art Moderne ( Paris ) * Fonds National d'Art Contemporain ( Paris ) * Fonds Rgional dArt Contemporain de Franche-Comt ( Besanon ) * Fonds Rgional dArt Contemporain de Basse-Normandie ( Caen ) * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muse des Beaux-Arts ( Angers ) * Muse Picasso ( Antibes ) * Muse des Beaux-Arts ( Caen ) * Muse de Grenoble ( Grenoble ) * Muse d'Art Contemporain ( Lyon ) * Muse dArt Moderne ( Sainte-Etienne ) * Muse des Beaux-Arts ( Valenciennes ) # Germany # * Lehmbruck Museum ( Duisburg ) * Museum Ludwig ( Cologne ) # Spain # * Institut Valenci d'Art Modern , IVAM ( Valencia ) . # Distinctions # * Knight of the National Order of the Legion of Honour ( France ) ; * Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters ( France ) .

4 ' ' Queloides ' ' is an ongoing cultural and curatorial project in Cuban art that seeks to highlight the persistence of racist stereotypes and ideas of racial difference in Cuban society and culture . Initiated in 1997 by artist Alexis Esquivel and by art critic Omar Pascual Castillo , who organized the exhibit ' ' Queloides I Parte ' ' , the project was later led by the late art critic Ariel Ribeaux Diago , who organized two important additional exhibits : ' ' Ni msicos ni deportistas ' ' ( Neither musicians nor athletes , 1997 ) , for which he wrote an award-winning essay , and ' ' Queloides ' ' ( 1999 ) . Queloides or keloids are raised scars that , many in Cuban believe , appear most frequently on the black skin . The title makes reference to the scars of racism , on the one hand , and to persistent popular beliefs that there are natural differences between whites and blacks . The main purpose of these exhibits was to initiate a public conversation around topics that had been taboo in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 ) explained , I , as well as other colleagues had many questions and concerns about racial prejudice in Cuba , and I was convinced that through art we could express a valuable and instructive point of view .. In Queloides we paid attention to a non-romanticized vision of the daily existence of Cuban blacks The artists focused on the black person as a marginalized individual faced with economic disadvantages , traumas , and self reflection . Although these were groundbreaking cultural events that addressed issues of race and discrimination in Cuban society , they received very little coverage in the Cuban press and were quickly forgotten . In 2010 historian Alejandro de la Fuente and artist Elio Rodrguez Valds organized a new edition of the exhibit , titled ' ' ' ' . This exhibit opened at the Centro Wifredo Lam in Havana in April 2010 and was later presented at the in Pittsburgh , in New York City , and the Neil L. and Angelica Zander at the W.E.B . Du Bois Institute for African American Research at Harvard University . The Cuban media ignored the exhibit again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including favorable reviews in leading art journals such as ' ' ' ' , ' ' ' ' , ' ' ' ' and ' ' ' ' . The ' ' Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ' ' called it a ground-breaking exhibition and listed it as number four in the year 's best art in the city in 2010 . In 2011 the important Cuban journal ' ' Artecubano ' ' published its own review of ' ' Queloides ' ' . Referring to ' ' Queloides : Race and Racism in Cuban Contemporary Art ' ' , literary scholar Ana Beln Martn-Sevillano ( 2011 ) has written : The impact of the ' ' Queloides ' ' sequence in the cultural field has made the term synonymous with the racial debate in Cuba . Designed with a comprehensive and inclusive view , one of the exhibit 's major achievements has been to include representative artwork that covers the diverse array of techniques and strategies used in contemporary Cuban art to address the complexity of the cultural and social processes of racialization .

After recording by himself what would become the album Foo Fighters , Grohl decided to recruit a full band with him as singer and guitarist . The original line-up included bassist Nate Mendel , drummer William Goldsmith , and Pat Smear . Taylor Hawkins took over the drums in 1997 after Goldsmith was fired . Smear left in 1998 being during the tour for second album The Colour and the Shape , with Franz Stahl becoming the guitarist for the reminder of the tour . Afterwards Stahl left for creative differences , and while the band recorded There Is Nothing Left to Lose as a trio , for the tour they again had a second guitarist , Chris Shiflett . Smear eventually became part of the bands tour musicians in 2006 , and rejoined as a full-time member in 2011. # Foo Fighters tour ( 1995-1996 ) # The first Foo Fighters show took place in February 19 above a boat house in Seattle and was performed for friends and family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 23 on the Jambalaya Club in Arcata , California ; the band were in the area mixing the album and a local promotor asked the cover band The Unseen if Foo Fighters could open for them , which they agreed to ; Grohl also played drums with The Unseen on a cover of Slow Down . On the spring of 1995 ( starting on April ) , the Foo Fighters embarked on their first ever United States tour supporting Mike Watt along with fellow tour newbies Hovercraft , whose line-up included Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder at the time . As well as performing with their own bands , Grohl and Vedder each picked up a role as a member of Watt 's backing band throughout the tour , supplying drums and guitar respectively .

514 ' ' The Checklist Manifesto ' ' is a 2009 non-fiction book by Atul Gawande . It was released on December 22 , 2009 through Metropolitan Books and focuses on the usage of checklists in relation to several different elements of daily and professional life . The book looks at the usage of checklists in the business world as well as the medical profession , with Gawande examining how it could be used for greater efficiency . Gawande stated that he was inspired to write ' ' The Checklist Manifesto ' ' after reading a story about a young child that survived a fall into a frozen pond and discovering that the physician that saved her relied heavily on checklists . Critical reception for the book has been mostly positive , with ' ' Newsday ' ' calling it thoughtfully written . The ' ' Seattle Times ' ' also gave a positive review . # Problems implementing the checklist # Doctors have said that when hospitals implement checklists , and study them with controlled trials , they often fail to improve quality as they 're supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors can check off boxes on the checklist without actually performing the actions . The actions must be observed . The actions also include having all members introduce themselves , and address any potential problems . The checklist is merely a tool for ensuring that team communication happens . Second , implementing the checklist is difficult . Third , hospitals need help to implement the checklist , as the Veterans Health Administration did . Fourth , gaming is universal . Some surgeons will resist . Finally , implementation takes time .

At its peak some 10 million men and women , 20,000 aircraft and over 10,000 armoured fighting vehicles were engaged in one of history 's most fiercest and costly struggles , While most of the central and eastern European nations were involved it was essentially a trial of strength between the two military superpowers of the day - Germany and the Soviet Union . # Game-play # ' ' Trial of Strength ' ' is a turn-based board wargame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanders who must determine objectives , allocate forces and execute operations designed to achieve victory over your opponent . The battlefield the game is played on is a hexagon-style 1:4,000,000 scale map of Eastern Europe with each hex represents 72 kilometres ( 45 miles ) from side to side . Each turn represents approximately 10 days , with 3 turns per month . Units are generally corps of the Axis and armies for the Soviet Union , both about 60,000 troops each , while also consisting of smaller battlegroups of specialist formations . On top of the Conventional Land-warfare , Integrated Movement and Combat System ( CLIMACS ) , players must handle game-play mechanics such as air power , command and control , morale , terrain and supply and logistics . ' ' Trial of Strength ' ' employs a special rule-set for the use of airborne , marine , mountain , artillery , rail-gun , rail construction NKVD and SS units . The presence of an integrated political system into the game-play caters for historical events such as the reticence of Finland and the uprising of the Slovaks among others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of Allied bombings and Partisans poses variable conditions for players . # Reception # ' ' Trial of Strength ' ' has appeared in a number of publications including Fire &amp; Movement magazine , where the game featured on the cover of the 10th anniversary edition ( number 49 ) in July/August 1986 and Breakout !

1514 In statistics education , informal inferential reasoning ( also called informal inference ) refers to the process of making a generalization based on data ( samples ) about a wider universe ( population/process ) while taking into account uncertainty without using the formal statistical procedure or methods ( e.g. P-values , t-test , hypothesis testing , significance test ) . Like formal statistical inference , the purpose of informal inferential reasoning is to draw conclusions about a wider universe ( population/process ) from data ( sample ) . However , it is to be contrasted with formal statistical inference that formal statistical procedure or methods are not necessarily used . In statistics education literature , the term informal is used to distinguish informal inferential reasoning from a formal method of statistical inference . # Informal Inferential Reasoning and Statistical Inference # Since everyday life involves making decisions based on data , making inferences is an important skill to have . However , a number of studies on assessments of students understanding statistical inference suggest that students have difficulties in reasoning about inference.Garfield , J.B. , &amp; Ben-Zvi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inference . In Developing students statistical reasoning : connecting research and teaching ( pp.261-288 ) . New York , NY : Springer . Given the importance of reasoning about statistical inference and difficulties that students have with this type of reasoning , statistics educators and researchers have been exploring alternative approaches towards teaching statistical inference . Recent research suggests that students have some sound intuitions about data and these intuitions can be refined and nudged towards prescriptive theory of inferential reasoning . ) . # Three essential characteristics # According to Statistical Reasoning , Thinking and Literacy forum , three essential principles to informal inference are : # generalizations ( including predictions , parameter estimates , and conclusions ) that go beyond describing the given data ; # the use of data as evidence for those generalizations ; and # conclusions that express a degree of uncertainty , whether or not quantified , accounting for the variability or uncertainty that is unavoidable when generalizing beyond the immediate data to a population or a process . # Core Statistical Ideas # Informal inferential reasoning involved the following related ideas * ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distributions , signal ( a stable component of population/process such as averages ) and noise ( a variable component of population/process such as the deviations of individual value around an average ) and types of ' noise ' or variability ( measurement variability , natural variability , sampling variability ) . * ' ' Sample size ' ' . Bigger samples are better because they provide a more accurate estimate of the population/process signals . * ' ' Controlling for bias ' ' . The use of random sampling to be sure not to introduce bias in the sampling process and thus increase the chance that the sample we get is representative of the population * ' ' Tendency ' ' . Distinguish between claims that are always true and that are often or sometimes true . # Tasks that Involve Informal Inferential Reasoning # Zieffler et al .

4 Roger Dowson Engineering , also known as RD Motorsport , was an automotive engineering company , and an auto racing team run by Roger Dowson . The company was founded in 1982 , and was most notable for running the works MG Metros in the British Saloon Car Championship in 1983 ( and running them until 1985 , after Austin Rover had withdrawn their support ) and the works Mazda teams in the British Touring Car Championship from 1992 until 1994. # History # Roger Dowson Engineering was established in 1982 by Roger Dowson , initially to build Group A specification MG Metros ( in naturally aspirated and turbocharged form . ) The turbocharged Metros had a claimed maximum power output of 190hpkW PS 0 . They ran the cars in the British Saloon Car Championship in 1983 under the Unipart with Daily Express banner , initially entering Patrick Watts in a naturally-aspirated MG Metro in round two , before entering Tony Pond in a Metro Turbo from round four onwards . Watts switched to the Metro Turbo from round eight onwards , whilst Martin Brundle was entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took two fourth places in Class C whilst driving the naturally-aspirated Metro , whilst Tony Pond took a Class B victory in the Metro Turbo . For 1984 , the team entered two Metro Turbos for the first six rounds of the series , driven by Robin Brundle and Watts under the Computervision Racing with Esso banner , although Austin Rover had withdrawn their works support . Watts took three Class B victories in the first four races , with Brundle taking the other . The team only competed in the season opener of the 1985 BSCC season , with Steve Soper driving a Metro Turbo . He failed to finish , due to a carburettor issue . In 1987 , Roger Dowson Engineering ran the ESSO Metro Challenge , a one-make series for MG Metro Turbos . They also made the kits used to prepare the cars for racing . 1987 also saw Roger Dowson Engineering enter the new British Touring Car Championship , running Jerry Mahony in a Class A Ford Sierra RS Cosworth in round six and round seven . The venture was not initially successful , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series for 1988 , now under the Arquati Racing Team banner , with Mahony entering all 12 events in a Ford Sierra RS500 . Mahony won the season opener at Silverstone , his first , and only , overall BTCC victory . Mahony also took four third-place finishes , and finished second in Class A ( seventh overall ) at the end of the season . The team entered Mahony under the Arquati Racing Team banner again for 1989 , but with less success ; Mahony took one solitary podium , and finished 15th in class ( 41st overall ) . Mahony left the team for 1990 , and joined BRR Motorsports , leaving Roger Dowson Engineering without a driver ( or main sponsor - Mahony took the Arquati sponsorship with him . ) For 1990 , Roger Dowson Engineering built the cars used in that year 's Mazda MX-5 UK Cup , a series won by Patrick Watts . In 1992 , Roger Dowson Engineering ran the works Mazda cars in the British Touring Car Championship , under the Shell Mazda Racing Team name . Watts was entered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be particularly successful ; Watts finished 18th overall in the driver 's standings , and Mazda finished sixth , and last , in the manufacturer 's standings . For 1993 , the team replaced the 323F with a Xedos 6 , under the Mazda Racing Team banner . It would be a much more successful partnership ; Watts finished in 15th place , with 24 points more than he 'd gained the previous season , although Mazda still finished last in the manufacturer 's standings . Watts also qualified on pole for the first , and only , time in his BTCC career , in the Snetterton round of the championship . For the 1994 BTCC season , Dowson collaborated with Team Dynamics to run the works Mazdas , and expanded to a two-car effort ; with David Leslie and Matt Neal driving under the Team Mazda banner . 1994 would prove to be less successful than 1993 had been ; Neal was forced to withdraw from the series , after suffering injuries from a big crash in the sixth round at Silverstone , whilst Leslie withdrew halfway through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a pair of eighth positions at the first two rounds , whilst Neal 's was a tenth at Snetterton .

Mazda were classified tenth , and last , in the manufacturer 's championship . Following the withdrawal from the BTCC , Team Dynamics and Roger Dowson Engineering fitted the running gear from the Xedos 6 into a Mazda 323F , with the intention of encouraging Mazda to return to the BTCC . Matt Neal was entered in the car for that year 's FIA Touring Car World Cup , but without any real success - Neal finished 22nd , and a lap down on the leader . Slim Borgudd , whom had won the Nordic Touring Car Championship in a Xedos 6 entered by Roger Dowson Engineering that season , faired little better - finishing 21st .

4 Nigel Sears ( born April 4 , 1957 ) is a British tennis coach , best known for coaching former top five players Amanda Coetzer , Daniela Hantuchov and Ana Ivanovic during his long career . # Playing career # Sears reached a career high singles ranking of World No. 382 on January 4 , 1982 , and a career high doubles ranking of World No. 581 on January 2 , 1984 . He lost his only professional singles match , but won two of the ten professional doubles matches he played . # Coaching career # Nigel Sears started coaching Slovakia 's Daniela Hantuchov in 2001 . Under his guidance , Hantuchov reached the world 's top ten , won the prestigious Indian Wells tournament in California ( though that would be her only career title until exactly five years later ) and reached three consecutive Grand Slam quarter-finals between the 2002 Wimbledon Championships and the 2003 Australian Open ( losing twice to Serena Williams and once to Venus Williams respectively ) . It was during 2003 in which the coaching relationship between Sears and Hantuchov started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hantuchov lost a marathon second round match to Ashley Harkleroad in which she made over 100 unforced errors , which led to Sears publicly criticising her attitude . Having reached a career high ranking of World No. 5 earlier in the year , Hantuchov 's results continued to deteriorate and by the end of the year she had dropped to No. 17 , leading to a decision to temporarily split with Sears . Sears and Hantuchov reunited in 2004 , but on-court results did not improve , as Hantuchov further slipped down to World No. 54 before a late season resurgence saw her finish the season ranked World No. 31 and with an even win-loss record ( 24 wins and 24 losses ) . The pair split permanently in 2006 , after which Sears was appointed the captain of the Great Britain Fed Cup team . In June 2011 , Sears was appointed the head coach of former WTA World No. 1 Ana Ivanovic , with a view of reviving her ailing career . Since his appointment , Ivanovic 's performances at Grand Slam tournaments have improved , and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter-final at that level since winning the 2008 French Open . However , regular success has been hard to come by in recent times , with Ivanovic being unable to beat top ten players on a regular basis and having not won a title , let alone reached a final , since November 2011 , and having suffered many heavy defeats along the way ( Ivanovic has suffered five 60 set losses since July 2012 , including a double-bagel loss at the 2012 Rogers Cup ) . This led to questions being asked about Ivanovic 's progress since appointing Sears as coach in 2011 . Sears was sacked as Ivanovic 's coach following Wimbledon 2013 , in which Ivanovic was defeated in the second round by Eugenie Bouchard . The promise that Sears planned in trying to revive Ivanovic 's career was never delivered , as she was only able to win one title , regularly failed to beat players ranked above her and was bageled five times , in addition to failing to reach a single final in 2012. # Personal life # Sears resides in the south of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kim Sears , has been dating two times Grand Slam winner Andy Murray since 2005.

4 rein GOLD . ein bhnenessay is a prose work by Elfriede Jelinek , the Austrian winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2004 , published in 2013 by Rowohlt Verlag . On 9 March 2014 its world premiere as an opera was staged by Staatsoper Berlin . ' ' rein GOLD ' ' is cast in dialogic form at the opening of which Brnnhilde diagnoses her father Wotan to be a victim of capitalism because he , too , has fallen into the trap of wanting to own a castle he can not afford ( This happens in every second family . ) . In a stream of consciousness the narrator touches on a number of events from the days of the Nibelungen Saga to the recent international financial crisis caused by the U.S. Subprime mortgage crisis and the role of banks therein . # Background of the work and its title # The title echoes Rheingold ( The Rhine Gold , 1869 ) which is the first of four operas in Richard Wagner 's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen . In Jelinek 's sarcastic phonetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title is dropped . This turns the name of the river Rhine into an adjective , rein , meaning pure . Among others , the work is inspired by the mid 19th century revolution in Vienna ( as studied in a publication by Hermann Jellinek in 1848 ) , by Karl Marx ' and Friedrich Engels ' Communist Manifesto ( published in London in 1848 ) , Marx ' Das Kapital ( 1867-1894 ) , and , last but not least , by Richard Wagner 's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen ( 1848-1874 ) and a recent study thereof by law expert Wolfgang Schild entitled ' ' Staatsdmmerung ' ' ( 2007 ) .

514 Paean ( foaled 4 April 1983 &amp;ndash ; ca. 1989 ) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire . A specialist over long distances he was ideally suited by soft ground on which he won the 1987 Ascot Gold Cup by a modern record margin of fifteen lengths . He had previously finished second on his only start as a two-year-old in 1985 and won five times as a three-year-old in 1986 . Paean broke down with an injury after his Gold Cup win and never raced again . In a brief stud career he showed some promise as a sire of steeplechasers. # Background # Paean was a bay horse with a large white star bred and owned by John Scott-Ellis , 9th Baron Howard de Walden a prominent member of the Jockey Club . Other horses to race in Lord Howard de Walden 's apricot colours included Kris , Diesis and Slip Anchor . Paean was one of the best horses sired by Bustino , who 1973 St Leger and the 1974 Coronation Cup as well as finishing second to Grundy in a famous race for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dam Mixed Applause also produced the St James 's Palace Stakes winner Shavian and , as a descendant of the broodmare My Game , was closely related to Marwell , Marling and Unite . Lord Howard de Walden sent his colt into training with Henry Cecil at his Warren Place Stable in Newmarket , Suffolk . # Racing career # # 1985 : two-year-old season # Paean 's only race as a two-year-old came in a twenty-runner maiden race at Newbury Racecourse in August . He took the lead approaching the final furlong but was caught in the closing stages and beaten a head by Kolgong Heights . Timeform commented that he would stay at least 1 miles and was sure to win a similar contest . # 1986 : three-year-old season # Paean developed into a successful racehorse at three , winning five of his seven races without being tested against top class opposition . He won a maiden race over eleven furlongs at Newbury and won minor races at Newcastle and Pontefract . At Beverley Racecourse in August he was moved up in distance and won a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of the season he faced slightly better opposition in the George Stubbs Stakes over two miles at Newmarket Racecourse on 31 October and won by half a length from Rosedale , a colt who had finished second in the St. Leger Italiano. # 1987 : four-year-old season # Paean began his third season by finishing third in a handicap race over fourteen furlong at Newmarket . He was then moved up in class to contest the Group Three Sagaro Stakes over two miles at Ascot Racecourse in May and finished second , beaten three quarters of a length by Sadeem . Paean returned to Ascot on 18 June for the Group One Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles . In the build up to the race , the Cecil stable 's main hope appeared to be Bonhomie , a colt who had finished second in the previous year 's Irish Derby . On the morning of the race however , the stable jockey Steve Cauthen , deciding that Bonhomie would be unsuited by the unusually soft ground , deserted the colt to take the ride on Paean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadeem , with Paean third choice in the betting on 6/1 , having been backed down from 14/1 at the start of the day . Paean took the lead half a mile from the finish and drew clear in the straight to win by fifteen lengths , by far the biggest winning margin in the race since the Second World War . His success was one of seven for Cecil at the four-day meeting . Less than a week after his win at Ascot , Paean sustained a serious tendon injury and was retired from racing . # Assessment # In 1985 the independent Timeform organisation gave Paean a rating of 85p , the p indicating that he was likely to improve . The prediction proved correct as he achieved a rating of 102 in the following year and a peak rating of 123 in 1987 . In the latter year , the official International Classification rated him the second best older stayer in Europe , three pounds behind the Premio Roma winner Orban . In their book ' ' A Century of Champions ' ' , based on a modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris rated Paean as a poor winner of the Gold Cup . # Stud record # After his retirement from racing , Paean was sent to Ireland where he stood as a breeding stallion at the Greenville House Stud at Kilmacow , County Kilkenny . He was marketed as a National Hunt stallion and stood at a fee of IR1,000 a mare . Paean survived only two seasons at stud but sired some good steeplechasers including the Whitbread Gold Cup winner Eulogy. # Pedigree #

4 The Juvenile Diabetes Cure Alliance ( JDCA ) is a New York-based nonprofit focused on bringing about a practical cure for type 1 diabetes . The organization defines a practical cure as any solution that gives people living with the disease the chance to live a normal , unrestricted life . The JDCA is a privately funded research and advocacy organization for type 1 diabetes donors . The independent nonprofit conducts analysis on major diabetes charities such as JDRF , writes reports on cure progress and charity spending , educates donors , and provides counsel for large donors on structuring their gifts . # History # The JDCA was founded in 2011 by Brian Kelly , chairman of gaming company Activision Blizzard , after his son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes . Kelly founded the organization to accelerate a cure for type 1 within his sons lifetime . He wanted to bring best practices from the business world to drive accountability in the nonprofit research world and stimulate high-impact giving . The mission of the JDCA is to direct donor contributions to the charitable organizations that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Practical Cure by 2025 . The JDCA is a 501(c) ( 3 ) organization funded by the Brian and Joelle Kelly Family Foundation . It does not directly solicit donations . # Advocacy # The JDCA advocates for research spending toward a practical cure that would enable people with type 1 to live with blood sugar testing once a week or less ; eat an unrestricted diet ; require only a simple regimen of medication ; sleep worry-free ; experience only minimal diabetes side effects ; and experience fast recovery from surgery . According the organizations research , only six research projects out of more than 300 currently in human clinical trials meet that definition . By publishing its own reports , the JDCA tracks how much money is being donated to diabetes research foundations and whether the funds are being used for cure research or other areas such as non-cure research , administrative expenses or public education . The JDCA evaluates and analyzes the finances of diabetes charities based on how publicly traded companies report their earnings and expenses , providing its network of alliance members with information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure research . In 2013 , author Brenda Novak donated all the proceeds from the ninth annual Brenda Novak for the Cure of Diabetes online auction to practical cure research at the Diabetes Research Institute . # Research # The JDCA issues regular reports on diabetes charities and research organizations . Its major annual report , State of the Cure , analyzes the donation revenue and spending of diabetes charities , including JDRF , American Diabetes Association , Joslin Diabetes Center and Diabetes Research Institute Foundation . The 2013 report found that only 2 percent of the funds donated to those organizations is spent on research that would deliver a cure for type 1 diabetes by 2025 . According to the JDCA , there are currently four pathways that meet the definition of a Practical Cure : islet transplantation ; drugs that would stop autoimmune attack and enable cells to regenerate ; devices that would reliably replace the function of the pancreas ; and cell retraining therapies . Within those categories , there are six projects in human clinical trials that could deliver a cure by 2025 : *Living Cell Technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lab at Mass Generals BCG Vaccine *ViaCytes stem cell therapy *Sanford Researchs combination therapy *Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc Monolayer Cellular Device Additionally , the JDCA tracks projects in animal and late-stage preclinical testing . The JDCA does not believe that diabetes foundations should abandon research projects that target complications , glucose control and prevention . Rather , the organization suggests that 25 percent of donations should support practical cure research initiatives . # Criticism # The JDCAs approach has been criticized as controversial for its focus on outcomes and expediency rather than traditional methods of deciding what projects to fund . Critics of the JDCA have stated that the definition of a cure can vary , a cure by 2025 is unobtainable and that treatment is an equally valid outlet for funding . Diabetes charities point out that they focus on goals that go beyond finding a cure , such as teaching people how to prevent the disease or reduce its effects through healthy eating and exercise . # References #

McGrath made his official debut at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester , England , where he joined his teammate Roland Green to take the silver medal and climb on top of the podium for Canada with a spectacular 12 finish . When he first competed for Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , McGrath scored a career-high , ninth place in the men 's cross-country race with a time of 2:20:33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two years later , McGrath continued to set another sterling record by picking up the bronze in the same tournament ( 2:13:43 ) at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne , Australia , trailing behind the British duo Liam Killeen and Oliver Beckingsale within a short riding distance . At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , McGrath qualified for his second Canadian squad , as a 32-year-old senior , in the men 's cross-country race by receiving one of the nation 's three available berths from the Canadian Cycling Association and the International Cycling Union , based on his best performance at the World Cup series , World Championships , and Mountain Biking World Series . McGrath could not match a stellar performance from Athens , as he suffered a tyre puncture and then had to ride the rim all the way around the tech zone in order to replace the flat tyre . Realizing that his new wheel contained a slow leak at the designated site , McGrath decided to end his course with only three laps left and a forty-fourth place finish .

4 Luo Hongxian ( 1504-1564 ) was a Chinese cartographer . After passing the Imperial Examinations with the rank of ' ' jinshi ' ' in 1529 , Luo worked as a senior compiler at the Hanlin Academy . He was a student of the philosophies of the Neo-Confucian Wang Yangming . Hearing of raids by Japanese pirates on China 's south-eastern shores , he began collating cartographical information for the Ming government , spending three years in research . During this period , he discovered the ' ' Yutu ' ' ( Terrestrial Map ) , an atlas of China created by Zhu Siben during the Yuan dynasty some 300 years earlier , which he adapted and expanded to create his ' ' Guang yu tu ' ' ( Enlarged territorial atlas ) , a work that covered the entire country . It was first published in 1561 , and remained the principal reference work in Chinese cartography until the 17th century . Based on his ' ' Guang yu tu ' ' , Martino Martini , an Italian jesuit in China , drew his own ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan Blaeu in 1655 . Martini 's map remained the standard European view of China until 1737 , when Jean Baptiste d'Anville published his ' ' Atlas de la Chine ' ' .

4 ' ' Zufari : Ride into Africa ' ' ( officially stylized as ' ' ZUFARI : Ride into Africa ! ' ' ) is an off-road safari trail at Chessington World of Adventures Resort , a zoo and theme park in London . The ride is located in the theme-park section called Zufari , a 22-acre site landscaped to look like an African reserve , it is home to animals such as giraffes , white rhinos , ostriches , blesbok , nile lechwe and more . # Ride history # In 2009 , planning started for a five year development plan , which would give the resort a ' Wild Adventure ' brand image . The plan to do this would run from 2010 until 2015 and included a Safari Attraction behind the hotels . Wild Asia was the first major installment and opened in 2010 as part of the re-branding , two years later in 2012 ToyTown was re-themed and plans for Zufari were submitted . They were later approved and construction of the landscape began in September 2012 . As part of the investment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add attractions to the new themed land . Part of the site home to Zufari began with the opening of the Wanyama Reserve in June 2010 , which is an African themed zoo area . In March 2013 , Chessington opened the Zufari area with the complete African landscape , merging the Wanyama reserve and Zufari into one . # Description # The ride is themed around an African Conservation team called A.C.R.E ( standing for ' African Conservation Research and Exploration ' ) who have discovered a new area within Africa , which they have named ' ZUFARI ' . The ride takes riders through the terrain of the Zufari reserve and shows the animals that it houses , with commentary from ' Chase Van-Driver ' an A.C.R.E researcher . Towards the end of the ride , near the rhinos , a tree blocks the path meaning that the truck needs to take a separate route though a dangerous cave , a water effects feature . # Reception # The ride received mostly positive reviews in its first season , with it being cited as the best attraction to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however attracted criticism for its short layout and lack of story . During its opening year the ride received wait times in excess of three hours . Opening the attraction increased annual park attendance by 15.4% , the highest of any European attraction in 2013.

134514 ' ' Bismarck : The Man and the Statesman ' ' is a biography of the German statesman Otto von Bismarck by the English historian A. J. P. Taylor . It was first published in the United Kingdom by Hamish Hamilton in June 1955. # Origins # In a book review written in 1943 , Taylor wrote that to write a life of Bismarck within reasonable compass would be one of the greatest of historical achievements ; but perhaps it is impossible . The material is overwhelming ; and to make matters worse , Bismarck himself has left , in speeches , conversations or his reminiscences , versions of all the principal events usually deliberately misleading . Taylor had previously written ' ' Germany 's First Bid for Colonies 1884-1885 : A Move in Bismarck 's European Policy ' ' and ' ' The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 18481918 ' ' , both of which in different ways covered Bismarck 's foreign policy . To learn more about his personal life , Taylor read many biographies of Bismarck and a few monographs in French , German and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later wrote that the biography was one of the books he had most enjoyed writing : I knew all the historical background already . Now I found Bismarck 's personality fascinating as well and he became one of the few I should like to recall from the dead . It is a very good exercise for an historian to stray into biography - a field seemingly so similar and yet fundamentally different . Perhaps no historian can really handle individual psychology or make an individual the centre of his book . All the same I think my ' ' Bismarck ' ' is the best on him ever written . # Contents # Taylor 's Bismarck is not the Junker and iron Chancellor but a complicated , urban intellectual , the clever , sophisticated son of a clever , sophisticated mother , masquerading all his life as his heavy , earthen father . Instead of working from a thought out plan for the unification of Germany , Bismarck was an opportunist , taking advantage where he knew he could succeed . An emotional man , Bismarck was able through politics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Reception # The book was an immediate success , outselling all of Taylor 's previous books both in Britain and America . Harold Nicolson in a review said he enjoyed Taylor 's irreverence and his sharp snaps of paradox . In a review for the ' ' New Statesman ' ' , the military historian Michael Howard wrote that # Taylor carries out his revaluation in the clear , sharp , epigrammatic prose which makes all his work as stimulating as champagne - and which makes one wonder , sometimes , whether it was all really as simple as that . His mind is a convex mirror in which events appear brilliantly coloured , brilliantly distinct , and sometimes a little distorted . He has many of the virtues of Macaulay , and one or two of his faults . The pattern is too sharply etched ; the epigrams are too neat ; the judgements are too final ; but how refreshing it is to read a historian who is not afraid of patterns , epigrams and judgements ! # The American historian of Germany , Gordon A. Craig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long needed account in English of the main facts of Bismarck 's career , an account which is at once readable , up to date ... and balanced ... In the second place , he paints a fascinating portrait of one of the most complicated personalities in an age which was filled with gifted and original minds ... The chapter on the corrosive effects of the Bismarckian tradition in Germany 's intellectual development is not the least interesting part of this highly provocative study . Fritz Stern reviewed the book for the ' ' Political Science Quarterly ' ' and said that while there are many other biographies of Bismarck that are more detailed , as a perceptive psychological sketch of this massively complex being , Mr. Taylor 's ' ' Bismarck ' ' stands unsurpassed . A German edition was not published until 1962 , and it was not much noticed there . However German historian Wolfgang Mommsen later said that Taylor 's biography was better than any German synthesis . # Notes #

233514 : : ' ' Not to be confused with the British boy band , One Direction . ' ' lastaired = present Juan Direction is a half-hour weekly documentary-style reality show airing in TV5 Philippines . It aired every Sundays from 10:15 PM to 10:45 PM . The documentary-style reality will airing starting June 23 , 2014 , from Mondays to Fridays , 7:30 PM to 8:00 PM. # Premise # Juan Direction follows five biracial Filipinos explore and learn the Philippines . The name Juan Direction is a play on words of the British boy-band One Direction , unlike 1D , JD does not perform any songs , but instead promotes the Philippines . Juan Direction actually means the Filipino way because Juan is a very common Filipino name , therefore representing Filipinos in general , and Direction because even while they are foreigners ( growing up in different countries ) , they chose to embrace the Filipino culture . The working title for the show during development was Half Filipinos . # History # The boys of Juan Direction got together in 2012 as Island Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel videos on YouTube . Their style is described as a vlogumentary , a mix of vlogging and a documentary , where they have sold buko juice , taho , and balut to name a few , as well as showering with a water pump . Island Media Asia served as a platform to propel them into the television market , and while they still continue to do videos online , JD is sort of an extension of what they did previously , so leaping to another medium was not a difficult transition . While IMA features 7 members and with JD having only 5 of those members , the other 2 ( Matthew Edwards and Keys Cosido ) do have a recurring role , whether they will become permanently part of the cast will become more apparent as the series progresses . Each member hails from different parts of the world , and even those from the same country come from different cities , and it was not until they came to the Philippines that they all met each other . They all met through the modeling industry that formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it became very easy for them to work together on screen . # Production # Before Juan Direction , the boys , as Island Media Asia , originally posted tutorial and documentary-style , and travel videos on YouTube .

390514 The ' ' Noli me tangere ' ' Casket ( ' ' Noli me tangere ' ' : Latin for Do n't touch me ) was a small silver-gilt casket made in 1356 for the Aachen Cathedral Treasury . It measured 15.2 cm in length , 3.7 cm in height and 4.8 cm in width . The casket was kept in the ' ' Marienschrein ' ' together with the key relics of the cathedral until the nineteenth century and the casket remained in the possession of the cathedral treasury until its destruction during the Second World War . # The origin of the ' ' Noli me tangere ' ' Casket # Four so-called great relics belong to Aachen cathedral : The dress of Mary , the nappy of Jesus , the decapitation cloth of John the Baptist and the loincloth of Christ , along with other lesser relics . Since 1349 , these cloths have been displayed and venerated as contact relics in Aachen every seven years during the Aachen pilgrimage . One legend says that it was during such a pilgrimage that a pilgrim was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sacred cloths , despite the strict guard . At the death of this pilgrim a year later , he is said to have repented of his deed and returned the stolen fabric to the Aachen cathedral chapter . The canon of cathedral chapter is said to have been so embarrassed by this evidence of his negligence that , in 1356 , he ordered the production of a small silver box to store the returned bits of relic in . After the casket was locked , he wrapped it in a green silk rippon , sealed it and attached a parchment , on which was written in Medieval Latin : ' ' Anno domini M CCC LVI in festo magne dedicacionis ecclesie beate marie virginis Aquensis fuit ordinatum per capitulum dicte ecclesie ad hoc indictum quod presens sarculum cui hec scedula est appensa de cetero non apperiatur et hoc propter specialem statum et utilitatem ecclesie antedicte .

On account of this inscription the silver casket became known colloquially by the name Noli me tangere . The expression derives from the Gospel of John , in which the resurrected Jesus prevents Mary Magdalene from touching him with these words ( John 20.17 ) . # Mysterious contents # In the following 448 years , no one changed the condition of the casket . It was removed from the Marienschrein along with the other relics every seven years , blessed , and then returned to the shrine . At the end of the late Middle Ages , the casket was often seen as a valuable relic itself and in accordance with its special significance as a relic its contents were not allowed to be view by anyone . A story was reported that a Dean of Aachen had opened the casket out of curiosity and was immediately struck blind as a result - increasing the mystery around the small casket . # Opening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been revealed by an accident .

Among other things , the casket was handed to her . The lock gave way when touched and the casket came open . Inside there were cloth fragments from the Aachen relics . The Empress was very frightened , since someone had told her the story of the blinded dean . With the opening of the casket the centuries-old mystery about the contents was finally revealed . # Location of the casket # At the time of the Second World War , most of the Aachen cathedral treasures were moved multiple times , ending up in Siegen , from which they were returned to Aachen once more after the war .

672514 The 192122 Georgetown Hoyas men 's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1921-22 NCAA Division I college basketball season . With John O'Reilly unable to coach due to illness , James Colliflower &amp;ndash ; a 1906 Georgetown graduate who played for Georgetown while at law school and then had coached the team for three seasons from 1911 to 1914 &amp;ndash ; returned to coach the team for one more season without pay . Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at Ryan Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington , D.C. and finished the season with a record of 11-3. # Season recap # On-campus Ryan Gymnasium , where the Hoyas had played their home games since the 1914-15 season , had no seating , accommodating fans on a standing-room only-basis on an indoor track above the court . This precluded the accommodation of significant crowds , providing the self-sustaining Basketball Association with little revenue with which to fund the team s travel expenses and generally limiting Georgetown to an annual trip to Annapolis , Maryland , to play at Navy and trips to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three road games a year from the 1918-19 season to the 1926-27 season in order to keep travel to a minimum . The 1921-22 team did not even visit Navy , but did make a trip to New York and New Jersey for three games at the end of the season . Otherwise , its only road game was a trip across town to play at George Washington . The Hoyas home winning streak at Ryan Gymnasium reached 44 games at the end of this season , dating back to a victory against Bucknell on the last day of the 1916-17 season ; it would reach 52 before finally coming to an end during the 1923-24 season . A highlight of the home season at Ryan was a major upset when Georgetown defeated highly rated Kentucky , which had won the first Southern Conference championship the previous season . Georgetown also defeated crosstown rival George Washington twice this season , giving the Hoyas a 16-game winning streak against George Washington &amp;ndash ; 11 of the wins at Ryan Gymnasium &amp;ndash ; dating back to 1915 . Senior forward Jack Flavin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he played in 13 games and scored 93 points for a 7.2-point-per-game average for the season . Senior guard Andrew Andy Zazzali saw reduced playing time this season because of injuries and because Georgetown chose to put younger players on the court . He nonetheless played in 13 games , scoring 38 points for the season and averaging 2.9 points per game . He made a running jump shot late in the Kentucky game that helped in the upset of the Wildcats , and that helped him win back a starting role in the later part of the season . In this era , each team was allowed to designate a single player to shoot all of its free throws , and junior forward Paul Florence was that player this season for Georgetown . He scored 18 points in the season opener against St. Joseph 's and led the team in scoring for the year , appearing in 12 games , scoring 136 points , and averaging 11.3 points per game for the season . He played a key defensive role in the upset of Kentucky . The team began the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three games of its season-ending road trip to finish at 11-3. # Roster # Sources Georgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season . The first numbered jerseys in Georgetown men s basketball history would not appear until the 1933-34 season . # 192122 schedule and results # Sources It was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules , with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season , so the February 20 , 1922 , game against the Crescent Athletic Club counted as part of Georgetown s won-loss record for 1921-22 . It was not until 1952 , after the completion of the 1951-52 season , that the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records . ! colspan=9 style= background : #002147 ; color : #8D817B ; Regular Season

700514 John Sheldon ( 17521808 ) was an English surgeon and anatomist. # Career # Sheldon was born in London on 6 July 1752 , and was apprenticed to Henry Watson , elected in 1766 the first professor of anatomy of the Surgeons ' Company . Sheldon studied and taught anatomy at Watson 's private museum in Tottenham Court Road , which was later wrecked by a mob . He received his diploma at the Surgeons ' Company on 2 November 1775 , and then lectured on anatomy at Great Windmill Street school under William Hunter . Sheldon was surgeon to the General Medical Asylum in Welbeck Street , and on 18 July 1782 he was appointed professor of anatomy to the Royal Academy in succession to Hunter . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 29 April 1784 , and on 20 April 1786 he became surgeon to Westminster Hospital , a post he resigned two years later . # Teacher # In 1777 Sheldon opened a private theatre in Great Queen Street , where he taught anatomy , and pursued research .

He believed that he had discovered an easy method of catching whales with poisoned harpoons , and he made a voyage to Greenland that year to test it . He was sent back on another ship , and from then on was subject to periods of bad mental health , now thought to be a bipolar disorder . Sheldon moved to Exeter . There he was elected surgeon to the Devon and Exeter Hospital on 25 July 1797 . In Exeter Sheldon belonged to the Society of Gentlemen , founded in 1792 by Hugh Downman .

Archibald Geikie in his biography of Barthlemy Faujas de Saint-Fond gives an account which may be garbled , and the Scot James Tytler has priority for British ascents , from August 1784 . Sheldon made a first attempt himself , on 16 August : a tethered balloon caught fire . Vincent Lunardi made the first ascent in England , on 15 September 1784 ; and on 25 September Sheldon again tried with his own Montgolfier balloon from Foley House , Portland Place , London . The balloon caught fire , and Sheldon with his companion Keegan were unable to get off the ground . This attempted ascent was then the subject of a caricature by Paul Sandby . Jean-Pierre Blanchard came to England in the autumn of that year , looking for financial backing for ballooning . Sheldon 's flight with him took place on October 16 . It carried scientific instruments , but failed to ascend : Blanchard threw instruments overboard . They landed at Sunbury-on-Thames , and quarrelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Jeffries , Sheldon then tried to have the Royal Society support more balloon ascents , but without success . # Works # Sheldon spent time in studying the lymphatic system , an area on which William Cumberland Cruikshank also was working . He devoted attention to embalming , too . Both interests came from William Hunter 's inspiration , and were lifelong . Sheldon had a celebrated body of a young woman embalmed : there are differing accounts . It was that of a patient who had died of phthisis in the Lock Hospital , and he embalmed it himself ; it was his mistress , he had William Hunter embalm it , and he kept it in his bedroom until his wife complained . The body was presented by his widow Rebecca ( died 1820 ) to the Royal College of Surgeons . * ' ' The History of the Absorbent System ' ' , London , 1784 ; only the first part was issued , dedicated to Sir Joseph Banks . * ' ' An Essay on the Fracture of the Patella or Kneepan with Observations on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; new edition London , 1819 .

The song was released as the lead single from ' ' Ghost Stories ' ' on 3 March 2014 , by Parlophone. # Composition # A beat consisting of a muffled snare and dusty bass riff is repeated throughout most of the song . As the song progresses , an organ is later added to the instrumentation which is eventually swapped out for a stomp-clap beat and again for a synth beat . Following the song 's second chorus , these beats are gradually combined together while Martin sings in falsetto . The song 's anticlimactic portion then decreases intensity until it has eventually resumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # The song was recorded by the band during sessions for their sixth studio album in 2013 , at their purpose-built studios The Bakery and The Beehive in North London , England , both originally constructed for work on their two previous studio albums , 2008 's ' ' Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends ' ' and 2011 's ' ' Mylo Xyloto ' ' respectively . The song 's bass riff , the first part of the song , was originally conceived by Guy Berryman during the band 's recording sessions in February 2013 . The song was then covered by singer/songwriter Lauren Aquilina for her BBC Radio 1 Maida Vale session . # Artwork # The single art for Magic was etched by British based , Czech etching artist Mila Frstov .

He added that the single does hint at a few new tricks up the band 's sleeve , and described it as a successful marriage of old and new . ' ' Rolling Stone ' ' magazine 's Kory Grow commented in similar tone , calling the song a return to form , proven to be Coldplay through and through . Digital Spy 's Lewis Corner concurred , writing : The song is n't a quick card trick to draw you in like some of the band 's previous hits , but rather a long-form spectacle that slowly allures you with its intricacies and delicate craftsmanship . Writing for Consequence of Sound , Alex Young opined that the track sounds a lot less Bon Iver and a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a Sunday afternoon . Carl Williot of Idolator noted the song 's Edge influence and commented that it showed a tonedown their trademark grandeur in exchange for a more minimalist , atmospheric set of songs .

Bill Lamb of About.com gave the song 4.5 stars out of 5 and called it a refreshingly simple , heartwarming love song . Writing for ' ' Los Angeles Times ' ' , Mikael Wood commented : With Martin 's delicate falsetto floating over a muted drum-machine beat .. this one offers up a sumptuous vocal melody and a surprisingly soulful one at that . # Awards and accolades # class= wikitable plainrowheaders !

22514 location=Leipzig ( version 1 ) * * /1732 ? location=Leipzig ( version 3 ) * location=Leipzig ( version 4 ) text = anonymous chorale = stanzas from 9 chorales ( version 1 ) The structure of Johann Sebastian Bach 's ' ' St John Passion ' ' ( ' ' ' ' ) , BWV 245 , is shown in tables below . The original Latin title ' ' ' ' translates to The Passion after John . Bach 's large choral composition , written to be performed in a Lutheran service on Good Friday , is based on the Passion , as told in two chapters from the Gospel of John in the translation by Martin Luther , and , with two short interpolations from the Gospel of Matthew . During the vespers service , the two parts of the work were performed before and after the sermon . Part I covers the events until Peter 's denial of Jesus , Part II concludes with the burial of Jesus . The Bible text is reflected in contemporary poetry and in chorales that often end a scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most Bach cantatas . An anonymous poet supplied a few texts himself , quoted from other Passion texts and inserted chorales by nine hymnwriters . Bach led the first performance on 7 April 1724 in Leipzig 's . He repeated it several times between 1724 and 1749 , experimenting with different movements and changes to others , resulting in four versions . The Passion , close to Bach 's heart , has an immediate dramatic quality . # Structure # # Text # # # Gospel # # The gospel account by John narrates the story in five scenes . The corresponding movement numbers are given from the ' ' ' ' ( NBA ) . Part I # Arrest ( 15 ) , , Kidron Valley # Denial ( 614 ) , , palace of the high priest Kaiphas Part II # Crucifixion and death ( 2737 ) , , Golgatha # Burial ( 3840 ) , , burial site Some musicologists regard movement 24 as the conclusion of scene 3 , the aria Bach incorporated two short interpolations from the Gospel of Matthew , # # Chorales # # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narration , stanzas from Lutheran hymns . Possibly Bach had an influence on their selection . He set them all in common time for four parts , the instruments playing with the voices . Five chorales conclude a scene ( in movements 5 , 14 , 26 , 37 and 40 ) , a chorale opens Part II ( 15 ) . Five chorales comment within a scene ( 3 , 11 , 17 , 22 , 28 ) . including the central movement of the whole Passion ( 22 ) . One chorale accompanies the bass soloist in an aria ( 32 ) . Most chorale texts were written in the 16th and 17th century , by authors of the Reformation such as Martin Luther , Martin Schalling and Michael Weie , and by hymn writers including Paul Gerhardt and Johann Heermann . The central chorale is not part of a common hymn . # # Contemporary text # # On a third level of text , contemporary poetry reflects the biblical narration . It was compiled by an unknown author , who partly used existing text . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etching by Christian Fritzsch ( 1744 ) File:Christian Weise Kupferstich von J C Bcklin.jpg </gallery> # Scoring # The work is scored for vocal soloists , soprano , alto , tenor and bass , a four part choir SATB , and an orchestra of two flauto traverso ( Ft ) , two oboes ( Ob ) , two oboes da caccia ( Oc ) , two violins , viola ( Va ) , and basso continuo . Bach added some instruments in arias for special effects , old-fashioned already at the time , such as lute , viola d'amore and viola da gamba ( Vg ) . Bach did not differentiate the vox Christi ( voice of Christ ) , singing the words of Jesus , from the other bass recitatives and arias , nor the evangelist from the tenor arias . # Symmetry # The work displays a thoughtful Symmetry#In music # Versions # Bach led the first performance on 7 April 1724 In version 2 , Bach opened with a chorale fantasia on In version 3 , after Bach wrote his ' ' St Matthew Passion ' ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bach returned to the first version , possibly in 1739 , but revised it thoroughly . He began a new score which covers 12 movements . As Christoph Wolff observes : The fragmentary revised score constitutes an extensive stylistic overhaul with painstaking improvements to the part-writing and a partial restructuring of the instrumentation ; particular attention was paid to the word-setting in the recitatives and the continuo accompaniment . Wolff writes : Bach experimented with the St John Passion as he did with no other large-scale composition , # Tables of movements # The following tables give an overview of version I of the Passion , first performed in 1724 .

514 There are several well-known and commonly used nicknames referring to Portland , Oregon . # City of Roses # The official , and also most common , nickname for Portland is The City of Roses or Rose City . The first known reference to Portland as The City of Roses was made by visitors to an 1888 Episcopal Church convention .

The first Portland Rose Festival was held two years later and remains the city 's major annual festival a century later .

On June 18 , 2003 , the city council unanimously approved a resolution adopting City of Roses as the city 's official nickname . # Bridgetown # Portland is known as Bridgetown or Bridge City due to numerous bridges crossing the Willamette and Columbia rivers .

There are four purposes that robotic lower limb exoskeletons can accomplish : * Enhancement of human performance , which typically deals with increasing strength or endurance ( see powered exoskeletons ) * Long-term assistance , which aims to provide impaired individuals with the ability to walk by themselves while wearing an exoskeleton * Study of human locomotion , which utilizes robotic exoskeletons to better understand human neuromuscular control , energetics , and/or kinematics of locomotion * Post-injury rehabilitation , which is intended to help an individual recover from an injury ( such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabilities ) by wearing an exoskeleton for a short time during training in order to perform better later without the use of the exoskeleton Robotic lower limb exoskeletons can be controlled by several methods , including a footswitch ( a pressure sensor attached to the bottom of the foot ) , gait phase estimation ( using joint angles to determine the current phase of walking ) , and myoelectric control ( using electromyography ) . This article focuses on myoelectric control . # Control Methods # Sensors on the skin detect electromyography ( EMG ) signals from the muscles of the wearers leg(s) . EMG signals can be measured from just one muscle or many , depending on the type of the exoskeleton and how many joints are actuated . Each signal measured is then sent to a controller , which is either an onboard microcontroller ( mounted to the exoskeleton ) or to a nearby computer . Onboard microcontrollers are used for long-term assistive devices since the wearer must be able to walk in different locations while wearing the exoskeleton , whereas computers not carried by the exoskeleton can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have to walk very far in a clinical or lab environment . The controller filters out noise from the EMG signals and then normalizes them so as to better analyze the muscle activation pattern . The normalized EMG value of a muscle represents its activation percentage , since the EMG signal is normalized by dividing it by the maximum possible EMG reading for the muscle it came from . The maximum EMG reading is generated when a muscle is fully contracted . An alternative method to normalization is to proportionally match the actuator power to the EMG signal between a minimum activation threshold and an upper saturation level . # Direct Proportional Myoelectric Control # With a proportional myoelectric controller , the power sent to an actuator is proportional to the amplitude of the normalized EMG signal from a muscle . When the muscle is inactive , the actuator receives no power from the controller , and when the muscle is fully contracted , the actuator produces maximum torque about the joint it controls . For example , an powered ankle-foot orthosis ( AFO ) could employ a pneumatic artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of the soleus ( one of the calf muscles ) . This control method enables the exoskeleton to be controlled by the same neural pathways as the wearer 's biological muscles and has been shown to allow individuals to walk with a more normal gait than other control methods , such as using a footswitch . Proportional myoelectric control of robotic lower limb exoskeletons has advantages over other control methods , such as : * Its physiological nature allows for an effective way to scale the magnitude of mechanical assistance from the exoskeleton * It results in reduced biological muscle recruitment versus kinematic based control methods * It allows easy adaptation of the exoskeleton control for new motor tasks However , proportional myoelectric control also has disadvantages compared to other control methods , including : * The surface electrode interface can often cause difficulties in obtaining a reliable EMG signal * The system requires tuning to determine the appropriate thresholds and gains * The musculoskeletal system has many synergistic muscles that are not easily accessible via surface EMG electrodes * Since neurological disorders result in decreased neuromuscular control , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use an exoskeleton with myoelectric control # Proportional Myoelectric Control with Flexor Inhibition # Direct proportional control works well when each joint of the exoskeleton is actuated in one direction ( uni-directional actuation ) , such as a pneumatic piston only bending the knee , but is less effective when two joint actuators work in opposition ( bi-directional actuation ) . An example of this would be ankle exoskeleton using one pneumatic artificial muscle for dorsiflexion based on tibialis anterior ( shin muscle ) EMG and another pneumatic artificial muscle for plantar flexion based on soleus ( calf muscle ) EMG . This could result in a large degree of co-activation of the two actuators and make walking more difficult.Ferris , D.P. , Gordon , K.E. , Sawicki , G.S . and Peethambaran , A. : An improved powered ankle-foot orthosis using proportional myoelectric control , ' ' Gait and Posture ' ' , 23 , pp 425-428 , 2006 To correct for this unwanted co-activation , a rule can be added to the control scheme so that artificial dorsiflexor activation is inhibited when soleus EMG is above a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more natural gait than with direct proportional control ; flexor inhibition also allows subjects to walk much more easily with combined knee and ankle exoskeletons with bi-directional actuators at each joint . # Applications # # Performance Enhancement # Performance enhancement deals with increasing typical human capabilities , such as strength or endurance . Many full-body robotic exoskeletons currently in development use controllers based on joint torques and angles instead of electromyography . See powered exoskeletons. # Long Term Assistance # One application of a robot lower limb exoskeleton is to assist in the movement of a disabled individual in order to walk . Individuals with spinal cord injury , weakened leg muscles , poor neuromuscular control , or who have suffered a stroke could benefit from wearing such a device . The exoskeleton provides torque about a joint in the same direction that EMG data indicate the joint is rotating . For example , high EMG signals in the vastus medialis ( a quadriceps muscle ) and low EMG signals in the biceps femoris ( a hamstring muscle ) would indicate that the user is extending his/her leg , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straighten the leg . # Study of human locomotion # Proportional myoelectric control and robotic exoskeletons have been used in upper limb devices for decades , but engineers have only recently begun utilizing them for lower limb devices to better understand human biomechanics and neural control of locomotion . By using an exoskeleton with a proportional myoelectric controller , scientists can use a non-invasive means of studying the neural plasticity associated with modifying a muscle 's force ( biological +/- artificial force ) , as well as how motor memories for locomotor control are formed . which can require up to three physical therapists to help partially support the body weight of the individual . Robotic lower limb exoskeletons could help in both of these areas . # Physiological Response # The neuromuscular system has targeted joint torques it tries to generate while walking . Assistive exoskeletons produce some of the torque needed to move one or more leg joints while walking , which allows a healthy individual to generate less muscle torque in those joints and use less metabolic energy . The muscle torque is reduced enough to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking without an exoskeleton . The net torque about each joint is the muscular torque plus the actuator torque . Disabled individuals do not see much of a decrease , if any , in muscular torque while walking with an exoskeleton because their muscles are not strong enough to walk with a normal gait , or at all ; the exoskeleton provides the remaining torque needed for them to walk . # Examples # * Vanderbilt exoskeleton * ReWalk * HAL 5 * Ekso Bionics # See also # * Orthotics * Neural control of limb stiffness * Powered exoskeleton * # References #

4 Epochalism an attitude of respect for the progressive spirit of the age and for social and technological advancement - was contrasted by Clifford Geertz with what he termed the ( essentialist ) valorisation of traditional values , as a central social polarity pervading developing nations . More broadly , the term used has been used to describe the post-Fordist , postmodern belief that the current era or epoch represents a fundamental clean break with the past ; is something unique in human history . # Polarities in emerging economies # Epochalism in the developing world can be seen purely as a progressive force , favouring movement toward secularisation and industrial advance , as opposed to a regressive return to the traditional values of community and Gemeinschaft . However , in practice the situation is likely to be more complicated : nationalist struggles for independence have often relied on essentialist appeals to authentic ethnic communities and cultural practices , as well as to epochalism , in order to free themselves from dependence on a Western model/Western control . # Internet epochalism # The rapid rise of the World Wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human phenomenon , wholly divorced from all past experience . Evgeny Morozov used the term epochalism to describe the prevalent 21st-century belief that one is living in truly exceptional times an intellectual fallacy I call ' epochalism . Previous technological advances , as with the age of railways or the age of broadcasting , had of course made very similar claims for themselves ; and A. E. Housman a century before had denounced the mind which commands no outlook upon the past or the future , but believes that the fashion of the present , unlike all fashions heretofore , will endure perpetually . Late modernity however , with its shortening of awareness of time-spans and its focus on the present , makes the short-sightedness of epochalism - with what Morozov saw as its dark fetishism of Internet-based solutions - an increasingly plausible intellectual posture .

4 Stord Kisgruber was a Norwegian mining company established in 1907 . The company operated the pyrite mines at Litlab in Stord , Norway . The mining operations ended in 1968 . A total of about eight million tons of ore was won during the operation of the mine . A railway line operated between Litlab and the quays at Sagvg . During the German occupation of Norway , the mines delivered pyrite to Germany for use by the country 's war industry . In 1941 this amounted to 9,000 tons per month . In January 1943 the mines were targeted by the British Commando raid Operation Cartoon . A museum ( ) has later been established at Litlab , to commemorate the mines and the accompanying society . 
4 Vikings in Georgia ( ) separated by several thousand kilometers , medieval Georgia and Scandinavia , surprisingly , had a common link . Around 1036 , a Viking force , known as Varangians or Varyags , unexpectedly appeared near the village of Bashi on the Rioni River in western Georgia . The old Georgian chronicle Kartlis Tskhovreba described them as 3,000 men who had traveled from Scandinavia through Russia , rowing down the Dniepr River and across the Black Sea . King Bagrat IV welcomed them to Georgia and accepted some of them into the Georgian army ; several hundred Vikings fought on Bagrats side at the Battle of Sasireti in 1046 . Other Vikings continued westward , thereafter disappearing from history . Swedish researchers recently suggested that the story in the Georgian chronicle was about the Swedish expedition by the Viking chieftain Ingvar den Vittfarne ( Ingvar the Far-Traveled ) , which features in many rune stones in mid-Sweden. # Bibliography # * Alexander Mikaberidze Historical Dictionary of Georgia , Historical Dictionaries of Europe , No. 50 ( The Scarecrow Press , Inc.Lanham , Maryland Toronto Plymouth @ @ @ @

4 The Hungarian Republic ( ) was a short-lived republic that existed between August 1919 and February 1920 in the central and western portions of the former Hungarian Kingdom ( encompassing most of present-day Hungary and parts of Austria , Slovakia and Slovenia ) . The state was established in the aftermath of the Hungarian Revolutions of 19181919 by counter-revolutionary forces who sought to return to the status quo prior to 31 October 1918. # History # On 6 August 1919 Istvn Friedrich , leader of the White House Comrades Association ( a right-wing , counter-revolutionary group ) , ousted the government of Gyula Peidl and seized power in a bloodless coup with the backing of the Royal Romanian Army . The coup d ' tat was met with widespread approval within Hungary . The next day , Joseph August declared himself regent of Hungary ( he held the position until 23 August , when he was forced to resign ) and appointed Friedrich as Prime Minister . He was succeeded by Kroly Huszr on 24 November , who served as Prime Minister and interim President until the restoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-communist authoritarian government composed of military officers entered Budapest in November on the heels of the Romanians . A white terror ensued that led to the imprisonment , torture , and execution without trial of communists , socialists , Jews , leftist intellectuals , sympathizers with the Krolyi and Kun regimes , and others who threatened the traditional Hungarian political order that the officers sought to re-establish . Estimates placed the number of executions at approximately 5,000 . In addition , about 75,000 people were jailed . In particular , the Hungarian right-wing and the Romanian forces targeted Jews for retribution . Ultimately , the white terror forced nearly 100,000 people to leave the country , most of them socialists , intellectuals , and middle-class Jews . In 1920 and 1921 , internal chaos racked Hungary . The white terror continued to plague Jews and leftists , unemployment and inflation soared , and penniless Hungarian refugees poured across the border from neighboring countries and burdened the floundering economy . The government offered the population little succor . In January 1920 , Hungarian men and women cast the first secret ballots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agrarian majority to a unicameral parliament . Two main political parties emerged : the socially conservative Christian National Union Party and the National Smallholders and Agricultural Labourers Party , which advocated land reform .

5514 FijiTuvalu relations are diplomatic and other relations between the Republic of Fiji and Tuvalu . Relatively speaking , the countries are neighbours in the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean ; Tuvalu lies directly north of Fiji , and they share a maritime border . Tuvalu is by far the smaller , lesser developed and more remote of the two countries , and is therefore dependent on its close relationship with Fiji . The two countries established formal diplomatic relations in 1979 , the year after Tuvalu 's independence from the United Kingdom . As of 2014 , their relations are described by the Fijian government as warm and friendly . # Overview # The countries were first linked together as British colonies in the late 19th century , when they both came within the jurisdiction of the British Western Pacific Territories , the administrative centre of which was in Fiji . After the Second World War , Tuvalu 's first doctors were trained at the Fiji School of Medicine , while some of the Tuvaluans from the overcrowded atoll of Vaitupu moved permanently to the island of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still live . Fiji continues to provide most of Tuvaluans ' higher education and vocational training , through the University of the South Pacific ( USP ) and the Fiji National University . Tuvalu does not have its own universities . Students attending the USP at its campus in Funafuti , Tuvalu , rather than its main campus in Fiji , can listen to lectures broadcast from Fiji , use audio and video-conferencing facilities and employ the USPNet system for communication with lecturers and other students . Tuvalu , a tiny country with a population of only 11,000 , has only four embassies abroad : its permanent mission to the United Nations in New York , its embassy to the European Union in Brussels , its newly opened embassy to the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) in Taipei since 2013 , and its high commission to Fiji in Suva . It is referred to as a high commission rather than an embassy because Tuvalu and Fiji are both members of the Commonwealth of Nations . Fiji in turn does not maintain any diplomatic presence in Tuvalu , but does have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Tuvalu . Fiji remains Tuvalu 's gateway to the outside world . The only flights to and from Funafuti International Airport are via Suva , on Air Fiji . In addition , Fiji is by far Tuvalus largest source of imports . When the head of Fiji 's military , Commodore Voreqe Bainimarama , took power in Fiji in a coup in 2006 , Tuvalu did not join countries such as Australia , New Zealand or Samoa in condemning the new regime . Tuvalu remained supportive of Bainimarama 's statements that he would restore democracy on his own schedule . Akuila Yabaki , of the Citizens ' Constitutional Forum in Fiji , noted that Tuvalu had little choice in the matter , as it was heavily dependent on maintaining good relations with Fiji . In 2013 , Sir Gordon Ward , a British national serving as Chief Justice of Tuvalu , was a denied a visa by the Fijian government to transit via Fiji on his flight to Tuvalu . Ward had previously sat as a judge in Fiji 's Court of Appeal , before resigning in protest against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuvalu other than through Fiji , Tuvalu 's Chief Justice was unable to enter Tuvalu .

4 Heneage Gibbes ( 1837 - July 18 , 1912 ) was a British pathologist . Born in Somerset , his namesake father was a minister and his mother Margaretta was the daughter of John Murray , an admiral in the Royal Navy . His paternal grandfather , Sir George Smith Gibbes ( 17711851 ) was physician extraordinary to Queen Charlotte while his maternal grandfather John Murray was an Admiral in the Royal Navy . At the age of fourteen he left home to sail to the East Indies and returned only at the age of twenty one , studied under private tutors and went to the University of Aberdeen . He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians in 1879 and in 1887 he became Professor of Pathology at Westminster College . He worked along with Emanuel Edward Klein and in 1884 , the two were appointed to the British cholera commission and sent to India . This commission was set up to investigate the claims of Robert Koch , who had identified the cause of cholera . Klein and Gibbes found fault in Koch 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arbor , Michigan in 1888 to succeed Alonzo B. Palmer as professor of pathology .

0514 : ' ' Main Article : Rakhat Aliyev ' ' The Nurbank bank , founded in Atyrau regional governor 's office was taken over by Rakhat Aliyev in January 2007 . Shortly after , two Nurbank managers , Zholdas Timraliyev and Aybar Khasenov , were kidnapped , tortured and eventually killed by Aliyev . In May 2007 , the criminal proceedings against Aliyev in Almaty began and Kazakhstan sentenced him for forty years . # History # In 1992 , the Nurbank bank opened for business and became the seventh largest bank in Kazakhstan . According to its Website , it is owned by the largest oil , food , publishing and foreign trade firms operating in Kazakhstan , and also currently lends to oil , food , foreign trade , and publishing &amp; information firms . In January 2007 , Rakhat Aliyev became the main owner and acquired about 75% of all Nurbanks assets . His father owned 6.71% and his 22 year old son Nurali Aliyev was a sitting board member . # First kidnapping # Around January 18 , 2007 , Zholdas Timraliyev ( vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered into a car and were threatened by Rakhat Aliyev , according to Abilmazhen Gilimov . Rakhat was looking to acquire possession of a prized financial building in Kazakhstan 's commercial capital , Almaty by ensuring ownership passed to him . They escaped after 24 hours .

They escaped after being held for 24 hours . They both left their positions at Nurbank on January 19 . According to newspapers , the building Aliyev wanted them to sell , sold on January 22 for a very low price , four days after the alleged first kidnapping . # Second kidnapping # On January 31 , Timraliyev disappeared again after receiving summons to speak with the tax police . Him and chairman of the board , Aibar Khasenov were reported missing . After a days of violent acts , both of the bodies were tucked into a metal drum , assailed with chalk and buried on a waste dump . During his kidnapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kapasheva ) and tell of his abduction . She reported them missing and her strong public appearance about the disappearance of her husband and mounting pressure against Alivey , the Kazakh authorities finally initiated criminal proceedings on May 10 , 2007 .

Timraliyevs wife was interviewed and several news outlets including , Svoboda Slova , Tasjargan , Vremya , and zonakz.net published her comments and now faced legal suit from Aliyev. # Criminal prosecution # Aliyev was quickly appointed the new Kazak ambassador to Austria on February 9 , 2007 as a polite way to get him out of the country . While in Austria , Aliyev announced his candidacy for the upcoming Kazakhstan elections and criticized the sitting Kazak President , Nursultan Nazarbayev .

Tthe domestic Kazak investigation concluded January 2008 and Kazak courts sentenced Aliyev to 20 years of imprisonment ' ' in absentia ' ' . His crimes were kidnapping , treason and plotting a coup d'etat against his father-in-law Nursultan Nazarbayev . Their second request for extradition in 2011 was also rejected , as Austria feared Kazak political persecution of Aliyev . They did however open their own investigation into Aliyev 's dealings . January 2013 , Ailyev claimed Kazakhstan was politically persecuting him because he rejected the political system . Viennese supreme court excluded political underpinnings as a reason for persecution , which helped to greatly legitimize legal action brought against him . # Other crimes # Rakhat Aliyev ( Shoraz ) is also suspected of the murder of opposition leader and former Kazak ambassador to Russia Mr Sarsenbayev in early 2006 , a complex embezzlement scheme stretching from Germany to Malta and Navis , torturing two Kazak bodyguards in 2001 , and the death of his girlfriend Anastasiya Novikova in 2004.
