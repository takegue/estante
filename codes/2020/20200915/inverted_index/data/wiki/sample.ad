4 The 2010 FIL World Lacrosse Championship was held between 1524 July 2010 . The premier international men 's lacrosse tournament took place in Manchester , United Kingdom . A record 29 nations ( not including the Iroquois team , which registered but did not compete because of passport issues ) competed at the event , eight more than the 2006 World Lacrosse Championships , which were held in London , Ontario . From its inception in 1967 through the 2006 event , the World Lacrosse Championships were sanctioned by the International Lacrosse Federation ( ILF ) . In 2008 , the ILF merged with the former governing body for women 's lacrosse , the International Federation of Women 's Lacrosse Associations ( IFWLA ) , to form the Federation of International Lacrosse ( FIL ) . From the 2010 World Championships , all future World Championships will be sanctioned by FIL . This was the third time that the tournament was hosted by Manchester , having hosted the 1978 and 1994 World Championships .

The events were held at the Armitage Centre , Manchester Universitys sports grounds . # Iroquois Controversy # The Iroquois Nationals ' participation in the championships was threatened in a dispute over passports . The team sought to travel on their Haudenosaunee passports , but the British government demanded evidence that the United States would allow the Iroquois to travel and return . Even after the United States Department of State gave the team a one-time waiver , the British government denied entry to the team , saying the Iroquois passports were unacceptable . As a result , the Iroquois would have had to forfeit their opening match against England , with the host team playing Germany in an exhibition match instead . However , FIL decided to move Germany to the Blue Division and the Iroquois to the Plum Division , making the England-Germany match an official one . The Iroquois team did not officially withdraw from the tournament , and would have been allowed to play its remaining games should it have resolved its passport difficulties . However , on 18 July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far to allow Iroquois to compete in the tournament . Each of the other three Plum Division teams were given 10 forfeit victories over the Iroquois team . # World Lacrosse Festival # For the first time in the history of the World Lacrosse Championships , a FIL World Lacrosse Festival had been sanctioned to run alongside the FIL World Championships . The Festival ran from Saturday 17 July to Thursday 22 July 2010 and was an open tournament between touring and club teams . It was played at the same venue as the World Championships . 64 elite touring teams are expected to compete in the Festival . In addition to this , a Community event kicked off the Championships and hosted local Primary , Secondary and Club teams . # Ticketing # Day tickets for the round robin stage of the tournament went on sale 1 February 2010. -- Tickets were divided into Stadium tickets , giving access to the main pitch where the blue division matches will be played , and Venue tickets , which only give access to the outer pitches .

Tickets are sold through the official website of the 2010 World Lacrosse Championships # Official mascot # A competition was organised , with voters being able to decide on which character the mascot will be . The mascot was a choice of either a British Bulldog or a Rhino . The English Lacrosse Association offered a Season Ticket to the Championships for the winner worth $197 and allows entry to watch every game of the tournament including the final . David Shuttleworth , English Lacrosse Association CEO said , Both these animals would make a great choice of mascot , both represent differing mental and physical attributes of a top lacrosse player .

The third and fourth place teams from the Blue had to compete in play-in games ( essentially quarterfinals ) against teams that advanced from the Top Bracket of the lower divisions . The fifth and sixth place teams from the Blue were eliminated from championship contention and instead took part in games to determine their final placement . Canada 's 10-9 win over the United States marked the first time that the American team lost a preliminary round game in any world championship , and only its third loss overall .

4 RocketMotorTwo is a hybrid rocket engine being developed for the Scaled Composites SpaceShipTwo suborbital spaceplane . The engine is being designed and built by Sierra Nevada Corporation ( SNC ) , and was first ignited in flight during a SpaceShipTwo test launch in April 2013. # Description # RocketMotorTwo is a throttleable hybrid rocket engine fueled with hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene ( HTPB ) and nitrous oxide sometimes referred to as an N <sub> 2 </sub> O/HTPB engine providing 60000 lbf of thrust . # Background # , Sierra Nevada has performed over 300 hybrid rocket test firings . The company also developed the rocket engine for the first private spacecraft to reach space , SpaceShipOne , which won the Ansari X-Prize in 2004 . Sierra Nevada is furthermore developing a similar hybrid engine , the Dream Chaser rocket engine . # Development history # # Hot-fire ground tests # Scaled Composites performed a series of subscale rocket hot-firings between June 2005 and April 2009 , before choosing a full-scale rocket motor design . By December 2012 , 21 full-scale hot-fire ground tests had been carried out on RocketMotorTwo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control of SpaceShipTwo 's proprietary Rocket Motor Controller ( RMC ) was successfully conducted . # Test program accident # On 26 July 2007 , during the early rocket testing phase , an explosion occurred during a propellant flow test at the Mojave Air and Space Port . The test included filling the oxidizer tank with 4,500 kg ( 10,000 pounds ) of nitrous oxide , followed by a 15-second cold flow injector test . Although the tests did not ignite the gas , three employees were killed and three injured , two critically and one seriously , by flying shrapnel . # Commencement of flight testing # In July 2012 , Virgin Galactic , the owner of VSS ' ' Enterprise ' ' the first SpaceShipTwo spaceplane built announced that RocketMotorTwo was fully qualified for powered flight , and that the ground test program was substantially complete . SpaceShipTwo conducted its first gliding test flight with the engine fully installed in December 2012 . Additional ground rocket tests continued into March 2013 as the company prepared for powered test flights . VSS ' ' Enterprise ' ' conducted its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first flight test of RocketMotorTwo . The test was a 16-second burn as planned , and was ignited at an altitude of , shortly after ' ' Enterprise ' ' was released from its WhiteKnightTwo carrier aircraft and the pilots cross-checked data and verified stable control . The RM2 control system opened the main oxidizer valve and fired the igniters inside the fuel case . The burn was completed at an altitude of , by which point ' ' Enterprise ' ' was supersonic , achieving 1.2Mach 55,000 . SNC stated after the test that The rocket motor ignition went as planned , with the expected burn duration , and good engine performance . # 2014 Change of fuel # In May 2014 , Virgin Galactic announced a change to the fuel to be used in the SpaceShipTwo rocket engine . Rather than the rubber-based HTPBHTPB engines had experienced serious engine stability issues on firings longer than approximately 20 secondsthe engine will now use a type of plastic called thermoplastic polyamide as the solid fuel . The plastic fuel is projected to have better performance ( by several unspecified measures ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitude . , the new engine formulation has already completed full-duration burns of over 60 seconds in ground tests on an engine test stand . However , four additional ground tests of the polyamide-fueled engine are anticipated before the SpaceShipTwo flight test could resume with the new-fuel rocket motor . # Production # The hybrid rocket motor and its oxidizer valve system are produced in SNCs manufacturing facility in Poway , California in conjunction with Scaled Composites . In 2013 , the Poway facility was reported to be currently producing motors for both SpaceShipTwo and SNCs own Dream Chaser orbital crew vehicle .

4 Nefertkau I was a 4th dynasty princess of ancient Egypt . She was the eldest daughter of King Sneferu and hence a half-sister to King Khufu . She was the mother of Nefermaat II and the grandmother of Sneferukhaf . Nefertkau is explicitly said to be a daughter of Sneferu in inscriptions from the tomb of her son and her grandson . Kurt Heinrich Sethe argued from the inscription in Nefermaats tomb that Nefertkau had married her own father and that Nefermaat was Sneferus son . George Andrew Reisner argued against this theory and suggested that Nefertkau may have married Khufu . He does allow for the possibility that Nefertkau married a noble man whose name was lost . Nefertkau may have buried in mastaba G 7050 at Giza . The tomb is not inscribed however so that the ownership is somewhat conjectural . # References #

4 ' ' Babesia bovis ' ' is a single-celled protozoan parasite of cattle which occasionally infects humans . It is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa , which also includes the malaria parasite . The disease it and other members of the genus ' ' Babesia ' ' cause is a hemolytic anemia known as babesiosis and colloquially called Texas cattle fever , redwater or piroplasmosis . It is transmitted by bites from infected larval ticks of the order Ixodida . It was eradicated from the United States by 1943 , but is still present in Mexico and much of the world 's tropics . The chief vector of ' ' Babesia ' ' species is the southern cattle fever tick ' ' Rhipicephalus microplus ' ' ( formerly ' ' Boophilus microplus ' ' ) . In 2007 , the sequence of its genome was announced . Measuring 8.2 million base pairs , its genome is remarkably similar to the genome of ' ' Theileria parva ' ' , the cause of East Coast fever ( theileriosis ) in cattle . # Infection # ' ' Babesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs , and can remain resident in tick populations for up to four years without infecting a vertebrate host . More commonly , a larval tick feeds upon a domestic cow , an African buffalo or a water buffalo , releasing the parasites into the animal 's bloodstream . The involvement of the larval stage of the ticks in the cycle is specific to ' ' B. bovis ' ' ; other ' ' Babesia ' ' species only involve adult ticks . The parasites then invade individual red blood cells , multiplying and destroying the host cells until the animal is stricken with hemolytic anemia . Adult ticks which feed upon infected cattle are infected themselves , completing the cycle . In humans , infection is rare and usually only affects splenectomized patients . # References

99514 NOTOC On a string instrument , position is the relative location of the hand on the instrument 's neck , indicated by ordinal numbers ( e.g. , 3rd ) . Fingering , independent of position , is indicated by numbers , 1-4 , and string is indicated by Roman numerals , I-IV . Different positions on the same string are reached through shifting . With experience , string players become accustomed to the required shape and position of the left hand . Some positions are located relative to certain touch references , or landmarks on the instrument . For example , fourth position on the cello ( used in the example below ) has the player 's thumb resting in the saddle of the neck root . Similarly , higher positions on the violin make use of the instrument 's shoulder ( treble-side edge of the top 's upper bout ) as a touch reference . Some electric string instruments , without a traditionally shaped body , still incorporate a reference feature imitating that shoulder 's shape . # Trombone position # The trombone produces notes within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In first position , the length of the bore is at its shortest ; seventh position puts the slide at its furthest extension , at the edge of the inner slide 's stockings . ( These are sections of slightly greater diameter at the ends of the inner slide tubes . ) Positions 3 and 4 may be located by referring the player 's right hand to the bell of the instrument . Each player has a different way of visualizing where the positions of the slide trombone are in relation to each other Positions , especially in the higher register , may need to be shortened or lengthened ( sharpened or flattened ) to play in tune . Lower-numbered ( shorter ) positions are closer together than higher-numbered ones . Positions six and seven are primarily useful in the lower part of the trombone 's range . Some notes may be sounded at more than one position ; for example , D4 may be sounded either in position 1 or 4 . As a result , trombonists often spend time studying a part to determine how to approach a particular @ @

4 The Texas Ballet Theater was founded by Margo Dean and Fernando Schaffenburg in 1961 as the Fort Worth Ballet , in Fort Worth , Texas . It became a fully professional ballet company in 1985 . In 1988 , after the demise of Dallas Ballet , the company began adding performances of The Nutcracker in Dallas in a business partnership with The Dallas Opera , producing Nutcracker performances in The Music Hall and using The Dallas Opera Orchestra . Fort Worth Ballet became the Fort Worth Dallas Ballet in 1994 when The Dallas Supporters of FWDB , a separate 501(c)3 corporation with its own Board of Directors , was established in Dallas . The Dallas Supporters ' responsibility was primarily to raise contributed funds so that Fort Worth Dallas Ballet could perform a full season in Dallas in the Music Hall at Fair Park . A detailed Joint Venture Agreement was established between the two organizations . FWDB - the Fort Worth organization - remained the primary employer and producing entity . All dancers , production staff and most administrative staff were employees of FWDB . The Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FWDB and The Dallas Supporters would negotiate an agreement outlining which and how many productions would occur in Dallas . The two organizations operated under this two corporation / two board structure for nine seasons . In 2001 , the Dallas Supporters were not able to raise the funds needed to produce the Ballet 's Dallas season , forcing FWDB to cancel productions planned in Dallas for early 2002 ; one Fort Worth production was also cancelled . This occurred during a season when FWDB had no permanent artistic director . Bruce Marks was serving as Artistic Advisor and Bruce Simpson as Ballet-Master-in-Chief . Over the 2002-2003 season , an agreement to merge the two corporations and their Boards was created . The resulting organization was then was renamed Texas Ballet Theater in 2003 . Texas Ballet Theater is a resident company of Nancy Lee and Perry R.

4 The Coleman Station Historic District is located around the former New York Central Railroad Coleman 's station in the Town of North East , New York , United States , a short distance south of the village of Millerton . It is a rural area including several large farms in the southeastern corner of the town . At almost three square miles ( 1812acre km2 ) , it is the largest historic district entirely within Dutchess County and the second largest in the county . Nine farms were established in the current district by emigrants from New England in the late 18th century . Those farms have since been subdivided and recombined under later owners , but their original boundaries were used to establish the district , a small valley along Webutuck Creek . Over the course of the 19th century they evolved from farms that primarily raised a diverse group of livestock for local and regional markets to dairy farms that used the station and the railroad line that ran through the middle of the district to sell raw milk to New York City . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district had become one of the city 's largest milk providers . At the end of the 19th century residents of the city began to make country retreats in and around the district . A century later some of them lobbied to create the district and list it on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 . One local farm 's resistance to that effort went as far as federal appeals court after lower state and federal courts had negated the creation of the district . Since then some newer farms in the district have used its historic buildings and farms for coffee roasting and low-impact sheep farming , among other . Many of the buildings in the district were erected in the 18th and 19th centuries , with little modification since then . They reflect , in many instances , different phases of agricultural development in the district . Five of these contributing properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . # Geography # The district is an irregularly shaped area whose boundaries follow either lot lines or the roads in the area . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Harlem Valley Rail Trail . The US 44/NY 22 highway is its westernmost extent , with a stretch of a half-mile ( 1 km ) in either direction from the Coleman Station Road intersection serving as the southwestern corner line , with the exception of a small newer farm on the east side of the road near the southern end . From there the boundary runs due east to the rail trail , and turns south . After following the rail trail for a thousand feet ( 300 m ) , it turns east again and follows lot lines first between fields and then through a large woodlot to Sheffield Hill Road . It turns south and then east , taking in another farm , and then follows the Connecticut state line , following it north to a dirt road along Webutuck Creek . It then follows the creek itself , excluding a large farm along the state line to the east . At Taylor Road it follows the road briefly , then a lot line straight east back to the state line . Just at the southwestern corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then north , and then east again at the rear lines of modern houses along Red Cedar Lane . It then curves north along Indian Lake Road to another property line which it then follows west , at the district 's northernmost corner . The boundary turns to the south along this line after roughly 1200 ft , then returns to its due-west heading for another half-mile , crossing the rail trail and Mill Road at their junction . It turns south at a cleared field in the middle of the woods , then follows lot lines back to routes 22 and 44 . Topographically , the 1812 acre inside this boundary is a bowl through which the creek flows , formed by ridges and plateaus of as high as 900 ft in elevation , and breached by valleys of the Webutuck 's tributaries in the area , and the Webutuck itself at the north end , near the lake . The station area that gave the district its name lies at the low point , around 580 ft . Most of the land is used for agricultural purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodlots . Because of the clearing , it offers scenic views in every direction , particularly of the Taconic Mountains to the north and east . The nearest settlement to the district is Sharon Valley , Connecticut , one mile to the southeast . Downtown Sharon is just east of Sharon Valley . The nearest New York neighbors are the village of Millerton , four miles ( 3 km ) north , and the hamlet of Amenia three miles ( 6.4 km ) south , along routes 22 and 44 . There are a total of 85 buildings , 23 sites and 9 structures within the district , most of them used for farming . Of these 117 resources , all but 29 are contributing properties to its historic character . Four of the farms and one former estate have been individually listed on the National Register . # History # What would become Coleman Station took a long time for Europeans to settle due to land disputes between the colonies of New York and Connecticut . The current boundary was resolved in 1732 . Even after settlement began , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century farming finally developed , moving from a diverse pre-industrial agriculture to a more specialized focus on milk production after the railroad and industrialization . Farming survived the decline of the railroads in the late 20th century . Newcomers to the region saw its historic value and fought a precedent-setting court battle in the last years of the century to publicly recognize and preserve it . Since then agriculture in the district has once again begun to diversify . # 17311771 : Early settlement # Tradition has it that the area , like much of the Harlem Valley in eastern Dutchess County , was thoroughly cleared and cultivated by Native Americans before European settlers arrived . That took later than usual due to the land dispute between the colonies of New York and Connecticut . Few settlers built homes in the 150 sqmi borderland known as the Oblong until the 1730s , when the two colonies agreed that the Panhandle , where Greenwich , Stamford and New Canaan are now , would be part of Connecticut while New York got the Oblong . The agreement allowed for Connecticut landowners to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have an incentive to pay for an overdue survey of the land . Even with these issues resolved , and land apportioned , sold and subdivided , there was still little settlement of the area throughout the mid-18th century . Indians , who had found the area a desirable place to settle while its legal status was unclear , established villages in the area , giving Indian Lake its name . Their presence in the area is recorded as late as the 1750s . Most areas of the Harlem Valley were difficult places to establish farms due to the minimal amount of arable land . The area later to become Coleman Station was an exception . Settlers coming west from New England found its alluvial soil ideal for farming . One family , Nathan Wheeler and his son Elijah , of New Marlborough , Massachusetts , bought over 200 acre , the first of two families by that name to establish themselves in the district , in the early 1760s . Another family , the Collinses , had already settled nearby but bought land in the district to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district , the farmhouse and barn at the Wheeler-Collins Farm on Coleman Station Road , have been dated to about 1771 , shortly after land-transaction records start being kept regularly . Thomas Wheeler of Woodbury , Connecticut , arrived right before the war , the other Wheeler to establish his family there . The other farms were established following independence . By the early 19th century four large farms existed , all linked to Wheelers. # 17711870 : Animal farming # As the New England farmers settled in their new home , under their new flag , their agricultural practices changed . In their home states , under British rule , they had primarily grown wheat for export . In Dutchess County , they began raising a mix of livestock and cash crops for local and regional consumption , building farms that reflected this with buildings and spaces dedicated to different species . They supplemented their farm income with the extraction of raw materials for early industrial production like iron , limestone and peat , from nearby hillsides and bogs . The 1850 census contains the first record of farm production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each , averaged 56 cows for milking , with twice that number slaughtered for meat . The former produced 300500 lb of butter and 150300 lb of cheese . Sheep were more numerous , about a hundred per farm on average , yielding 200400 lb of wool each year . They were joined by 2030 pigs , oxen used as beasts of burden and horses for personal transportation . Most improved land on the farms was used as pasture ; cropland was used mostly for animal feed , hay and potatoes . Ten years later , the 1860 census shows a dramatic change in animals raised . Cow herds have gained at the expense of pigs and sheep , and the number of milking cows increased to 1020 , with no change in the crops grown . This reflects the 1852 advent of the New York and Harlem Railroad , the state 's first , into the area , and with it a milk-processing plant in Wassaic to the south . Farmers could now get their milk and products to the growing New York City market , making dairy farming much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded fluid milk production , with the Coleman Station farmers ' herds putting out 1000015000 usgal annually . Farms still produced their own butter in quantity , but left cheese production and its enormous fluid milk requirements to the processing plant . It was the beginning of a shift from the diverse animal farming which had characterized the district earlier in the century to almost exclusively dairy farming , as it is today . Barns grew bigger to accommodate the larger cattle herds and more land was given over to pasture and feed crops . # 18501923 : Conversion to dairy farming and tourism # With the coming of the railroad , local entrpreneur Amasa Coleman lobbied for the construction of the station that would take its name from him and give it to the area . He and Oliver Barrett convinced what was by then the New York Central that a separate stop less than two miles ( 3 km ) north of its Sharon station would help it better serve both the vacationers headed for that town across the state line and the farmers . The station spurred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished today . Indian Lake Road was rerouted to the east side of the line ( the original roadbed is still visible near the current overpass ) and a rock cut created through the Wheeler-Bassett Farm . In the Great Blizzard of 1888 a five-locomotive plowing team was utterly wrecked when it crashed into snow that had accumulated in the cut . Five members of the train crew were killed . The railroad 's presence led to an old farmhouse , today known as Mutton Hill , at the southeast corner of the district , being renovated for use as country house . It was the only one in the district until 1903 when Thomas Hidden , a recently retired New York City industrialist , bought portions of four of the old farms on Sheffield Hill Road to create his Hiddenhurst estate . He may have chosen the Coleman Station area over the more popular Sharon area to the south since he was interested in raising horses on the property . He built a large stable and indoor training course , neither extant . The ornate neo-Georgian main house is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two years after Hidden 's death in 1918 , his estate was purchased by the Sheffield Milk Company , which combined his property with others it had acquired nearby and established a large corporate farm . It demolished Hidden 's stable and training facility and erected a large dairy complex on its site along with housing for its workers . A new owner of the Wheeler Farm on Taylor Road around this time renovated its house to attract summer boarders , and distributed a brochure promoting it through the railroad . They may not have been the only ones . The transition of the district from an insular farming community , where agriculture defined residents socially as well as economically , to one in which it was purely a business was now complete . # 19232000 : Preservation and litigation # Change would continue . In the 1950s Sheffield , now one of the largest milk suppliers to New York City , was bought out by the Sealtest conglomerate . Two decades later the railroad , by now the nearly bankrupt Penn Central , ended passenger service along the railroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade , after which the tracks were removed . In 1985 the Ezra Clark House became the first property in Coleman Station to be listed on the National Register . The owners of Hiddenhurst demolished a remaining brick house and carriage house from one of the original farms a few years later , prior to that property 's 1991 listing . Around that time owners of weekend homes and other residents of the area began working for the creation of a historic district around Coleman Station , forming the advocacy group Friends of Coleman Station . Many of them were also concerned about the large-scale composting activities of McEnroe Farms , one of the largest organic farms in the state , which they felt threatened the watershed with potentially toxic runoff from its manure piles and which fouled the air with strong odors . The farm owners and operator feared that historic designation would bring with it local zoning regulations that would limit their activities to an extent that the farm would become less profitable . After the listing on the New York State Register of Historic Places in 1993 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed with a listing on the National Register two months later . McEnroe successfully petitioned a state court to have the district 's creation overturned on the grounds that it was not of sufficient historic importance and that notice of the state designation had been neither timely nor accompanied with written support as required by regulations of the state 's Historic Preservation Office . # 2000-present : Revitalization # After the creation of the district , Sealtest itself became a brand name of the Canadian conglomerate Agropur . A new agricultural product was added to the district in 1999 , when the owners of the Manhattan coffeehouse 71 Irving Place opened a roasting facility in a former carriage house on Reagan Road . They cited the area 's preserved historic character as a major reason for locating there . Since then what is now known as the Irving Farm Coffee Company has expanded both at its original site and to other locations near Millerton . A mother-daughter team has also brought sheep farming back to the district at Dashing Star Farm , the renamed Stephen Wheeler Farm . In the 21st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harlem Valley Rail Trail was created . Metro-North Railroad restored Harlem Line passenger service to a new Wassaic station , at the rail trail 's southern end . It continues through the district to the old Millerton station . The former Coleman 's station site is now used as parking for the bicyclists and walkers who use the trail . Friends of Coleman Station continues to be active in preserving and promoting the district . It works out of a small headquarters on Indian Lake Road with research materials that is open to the public by appointment . It maintains the small Coleman Station Burying Ground and the Diana K. Temple Memorial Garden along the rail trail , with native plants , trees and shrubs . Every year it hosts an annual cleanup of the district , with the occasional house and district tour . # Significant contributing properties # Five properties within the district , all farms or former farms , are listed on the Register in their own right .

Simon Vozick-Levinson of ' ' Entertainment Weekly ' ' gave ' ' 5.0 ' ' a B rating and commented that on ' ' 5.0 ' ' Nelly makes a reasonably convincing case that he can keep the momentum going .

Jesse Cataldo from Slant Magazine gave the album a rating of two stars ( out of five ) . Cataldo said that ' ' 5.0 ' ' is never overtly awful , but it definitely sinks into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albums , where they sit like dishes moldering beneath dirty water . Cataldo said that Nelly has lost his charm and playfulness he began with on the albums following ' ' Country Grammar ' ' . He felt that what is left is a murky stew of withered affections and grasps at modernity , from siren effects to processed horns and Auto-Tune breakdowns . Cataldo said that the album contains A collection of collaborations with low-wattage names and also-rans , it basically indicates that even if Nelly is still trying ( which he does n't seem to be ) , he has n't sustained the credibility to achieve a plausible comeback . Andy Kellman from Allmusic also gave the album two stars ( out of five ) . Kellman said that nothing on the rappers sixth studio album encourages repeated listening . He felt that Nellys exuberance often sounds feigned , the rallying choruses are not effective , and he s short on ideas . Kellman concluded his review by saying that ' ' 5.0 ' ' is by a considerable margin , Nellys least essential release to date . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from album booklet . * Track five , Making Movies and track nine , Do n't It Feel Good , features uncredited vocals by Rico Love . ; Sample credits * Track two , Long Gone , contains a sample of Let 's Start Love Over , as performed by Miles Jaye. * Track seven , 1000 Stacks , features a sample of Everyday Struggle , written by Christopher Wallace , Dave Grusin , Harvey Mason , Norman Glover , Reginald Ellis , embodies portions of Kick in the Door , written by Christopher Wallace , Christopher Martin and Jalacy Hawkins , both performed by The Notorious B.I.G . and uncredited vocals by Diddy. * Track fifteen , k.I.s.s , contains portions of Kissing You , written by Julian Jackson , Brion James , Janice Johnson and Charles Wiggins . # Credits and personnel # Adapted from Allmusic and album booklet . ; Creativity and management * Cornell Haynes , Jr .

Controversy surrounded the inning , as Adrin Beltr was the victim of a blown call . Beltr grounded a ball to third , and Descalso threw the ball to first for the out , but replays showed he fouled the ball off his foot . # Game 2 # Thursday , October 20 , 2011 8:05 pm ( EDT ) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis , Missouri Game 2 saw a pitchers ' duel between Jaime Garca and Colby Lewis . Both starters kept the game scoreless through the first six innings . A pair of excellent defensive plays by Elvis Andrus stopped a couple of Cardinals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rally for St. Louis , much like in Game 1 . He singled with one out , and moved to third on a single by Nick Punto with two outs .

Andrus singled into center field , and moved to second on the throw home , which got by Albert Pujols for an error . With runners on second and third , and none out , Tony La Russa switched in Arthur Rhodes for Motte . Consecutive sacrifice flies from Josh Hamilton and Michael Young gave Texas the lead . Neftal Feliz came on in the ninth , and allowed a leadoff walk to Yadier Molina , but retired the next three batters in order to end the game and tie the Series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , October 22 , 2011 8:05 pm ( EDT ) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington , Texas After a total of just eight runs scored in the first two games in St. Louis , the offense of the two lineups scored a combined 23 runs on a historic night in Arlington in which Albert Pujols had what was described as the greatest individual hitting performance in World Series history . Allen Craig hit a home run in the first to put the Cardinals up 10 . They scored four more runs in the fourth after a controversial call at first base by umpire Ron Kulpa and a run-producing error by Mike Napoli , but the Rangers came back in the bottom frame : Michael Young and Nelson Cruz hit home runs to make it 53 . But in the next inning the Cardinals added three more runs including what became the game-winning two-RBI double by Yadier Molina making the score 83 . The Rangers answered with three runs in the bottom half of the inning to make it a two-run game again . Albert Pujols , who had been hitless through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home run off Alexi Ogando in the sixth inning to drive in three runs . He homered two more times later and drove in six runs in total on the night . The Cardinals went on to win the game by a score of 167 , leading the Series by 21 . Albert Pujols joined Babe Ruth ( 1926 , 1928 ) and Reggie Jackson ( 1977 ) as the only players in baseball history up to that time to hit three home runs in a World Series game . ( Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year . ) Pujols was 5-for-6 with two singles , three HRs , four runs scored , and six RBIs . Yadier Molina added two doubles , driving in four runs . David Freese continued his postseason 13-game hitting streak getting two hits ( one double ) , driving in two runs . Pujols became the first player in World Series history to get hits in four consecutive innings : fourth ( single ) , fifth ( single ) , sixth ( HR , three RBIs ) , and seventh ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most HRs ( 3 ) , most hits ( 5 ) , and most RBIs ( 6 ) in a World Series game , and established a new record with 14 total bases . The 16 runs scored by the Cardinals were the most runs scored in a World Series game since 2002 , when the San Francisco Giants scored 16 against the Anaheim Angels . The current record is 18 by the New York Yankees against the New York Giants in 1936. # Game 4 # Sunday , October 23 , 2011 8:05 pm ( EDT ) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington , Texas After a high scoring affair the night before , Derek Holland quieted the Cardinals ' bats as he pitched innings of two-hit baseball . Lance Berkman had both of the Cardinals ' two hits . Josh Hamilton 's first-inning RBI double put the Rangers in front for only the second time in the Series . A three-run home run by Mike Napoli provided Holland a comfortable 40 lead . The Cardinals managed a small rally in the ninth , but were unable to score against closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2011 8:05 pm ( EDT ) at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington , Texas Game 1 starters C. J. Wilson and Chris Carpenter faced off again . Wilson walked two batters , Matt Holliday and Lance Berkman , in the second inning and both came in to score , aided in part by an error by David Murphy . However , despite the Rangers walking nine batters in the game ( including Albert Pujols three times intentionally ) , the Cardinals had not scored again , leaving twelve runners on base . Mitch Moreland hit a solo home run in the third , and Adrin Beltr also hit one in the sixth , to tie the score at 22 . The Rangers ' half of the eighth featured a series of bullpen mix-ups by the Cardinals , leaving Tony La Russa without closer Jason Motte in a crucial situation . After Michael Young led off the inning with a double , La Russa sent both Motte ( a right-hander ) and left-handed reliever Marc Rzepczynski to begin warmups . However , Cardinals bullpen coach Derek Lilliquist later stated that he only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Motte was not warming up , he made a second call to the bullpen , but this time Lilliquist thought he heard La Russa called for reliever Lance Lynn , who was supposedly unavailable for the game due to throwing 47 pitches in Game 3 . Dotel intentionally walked Nelson Cruz , whereupon La Russa summoned Rzepczynski to face the left-handed hitting Murphy . Usually , the Rangers would counter with a right-handed pinch-hitter , such as Craig Gentry or Yorvit Torrealba . However , Murphy stayed in the game , and hit a grounder off Rzepczynski , loading the bases . With Motte not yet available ( La Russa thought he was warming up , but he was not yet ready ) , La Russa was forced to match Rzepczynski against the right-handed hitting Mike Napoli , who hit a two-run double scoring Young and Cruz . After a Moreland strikeout , La Russa summoned for Motte from the bullpen , only to be surprised to see Lynn coming out ( it was then when he learned of the mix-ups ) . Lynn then was asked to intentionally walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Series history to make a relief appearance solely to serve an intentional walk . Neftal Feliz came in to save the game in the ninth , his second save of the Series . # Game 6 # Thursday , October 27 , 2011 8:05 pm ( EDT ) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis , Missouri Game 6 was a rematch of Game 2 's starters : Cardinals lefty Jaime Garca and Rangers starter Colby Lewis . Texas jumped on top immediately , with Josh Hamilton driving in Ian Kinsler in the top of the first . The Cardinals responded quickly with a two-run Lance Berkman home run in the bottom half . Kinsler tied the game in the top of the second with a ground-rule double , scoring Craig Gentry . Garca was pulled after only three innings ( and 59 pitches ) and replaced with Fernando Salas . Leading off the top of the fourth , Matt Holliday misplayed a Nelson Cruz pop fly , putting Cruz at second . Mike Napoli singled him home to once again give Texas the lead . The Cardinals jumped right back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error and scoring on a Yadier Molina groundout to knot the game at three . David Freese started off the top of the fifth by dropping a routine pop fly ( the third consecutive half-inning to begin with an error ) , which immediately turned into the go-ahead run for Texas on Young 's double . Colby Lewis was cruising for the Rangers until the bottom of the sixth . After an Albert Pujols strikeout , Berkman singled to third . Matt Holliday grounded into a possible double play which was mishandled at first by Michael Young ( his second error of the game ) , leaving all runners safe . Lewis walked the bases loaded and was pulled for Alexi Ogando , who promptly walked Yadier Molina to force in a run . With the Cardinals in a prime position to rally ahead , Matt Holliday , standing 90 ft away as the possible go-ahead run , was picked off at third by catcher Mike Napoli . Holliday injured his finger sliding in on the play and was forced to leave the game . The Rangers were able to slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lance Lynn came on to pitch for the Cardinals in the top of the seventh and was promptly greeted with back-to-back home runs by Adrin Beltr and Nelson Cruz to put Texas up by two . Ian Kinsler added his second RBI later in the inning to make the score 74 Rangers . In the bottom of the eighth , Allen Craig ( who entered the game as Holliday 's replacement ) hit a solo home run to pull the Cardinals within two . Rangers closer Neftal Feliz entered in the bottom of the ninth to deliver the Rangers their first ever World Series Championship . After striking out Ryan Theriot , Feliz faced Albert Pujols . Facing possibly his last at-bat as a Cardinal , Pujols hit Feliz 's first pitch into left field for a double . Feliz walked Lance Berkman to put the tying run on first , but got Craig to take a called third strike . The Rangers were one out away from a championship as David Freese stepped to the plate . Down in the count 12 , Freese hit Feliz 's pitch past a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tying the game at seven in dramatic fashion . Sent into extra innings , the Rangers ' MVP candidate Josh Hamilton put Texas up again with a towering two-run home run . Down 97 , the Cardinals once again faced only three outs until elimination . St. Louis manufactured a run to make it 98 , and following an intentional Albert Pujols walk Lance Berkman was at the dish . Berkman worked the count to 22 , again the Rangers were one strike away from their first championship . Berkman took Scott Feldman 's next pitch into center field for a single , scoring Jon Jay and tying the game once again . It was the first time in World Series history that a team came back from two different two-run deficits in the ninth inning or later in the same game . The Rangers failed to score in the top of the 11th , bringing David Freese to lead off the bottom of the inning . Freese hit Mark Lowe 's 32 pitch into the center field grass for a game-winning home run , forcing the World Series to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 13 instances in which a Major League team won a Game 6 at home to force a Game 7 in the postseason , all but one went on to win Game 7 . The exception was the New York Mets in the 2006 NLCS , against , incidentally , the Cardinals . Freese 's walk-off home run was only the fourth in a Game 6 in World Series history . The Cardinals set two milestones in their Game 6 winthe first team to come back from deficits in both the 9th and 10th innings , and the first team to score in the 8th , 9th , 10th , and 11th innings . On ' ' Mike and Mike in the Morning ' ' the next day , ESPN senior baseball analyst Buster Olney called it the greatest game in the history of baseball .

David Freese and Lance Berkman became the third and fourth players in World Series history to get game-tying hits with their team one out from elimination . Freese , who grew up a Cardinal fan in the suburbs of St. Louis , said that as he was circling the bases after his home run , he was thinking about a similar walk-off homer by Jim Edmonds for the Cardinals in Game 6 of the 2004 National League Championship Series . After Freese said he remembered that home run , Lance Berkman , who played for the losing Houston Astros in that series , said So do I . # Game 7 # Friday , October 28 , 2011 8:05 pm ( EDT ) at Busch Stadium in St. Louis , Missouri Before Game 7 , the Cardinals replaced Matt Holliday , who sprained his wrist in Game 6 , on their roster with Adron Chambers .

Wilson came on to relieve Feldman and promptly hit Rafael Furcal with his first pitch , forcing in another run to make it 52 . In the seventh inning , Lance Berkman scored on a Molina single to make it 62 . Chris Carpenter was relieved after pitching six innings and was credited with the win . The Cardinals used four relievers to hold Texas scoreless over the final three innings .

4 Bat-inspired algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm developed by Xin-She Yang in 2010 . This bat algorithm is based on the echolocation behaviour of microbats with varying pulse rates of emission and loudness. # Algorithm Description # The idealization of the echolocation of microbats can be summarized as follows : Each virtual bat flies randomly with a velocity <math> vi </math> at position ( solution ) <math> xi </math> with a varying frequency or wavelength and loudness <math> Ai </math> . As it searches and finds its prey , it changes frequency , loudness and pulse emission rate <math> r </math> . Search is intensified by a local random walk . Selection of the best continues until certain stop criteria are met . This essentially uses a frequency-tuning technique to control the dynamic behaviour of a swarm of bats , and the balance between exploration and exploitation can be controlled by tuning algorithm-dependent parameters in bat algorithm . A detailed introduction of metaheuristic algorithms including the bat algorithm is given by Yang where a demo program in Matlab/Octave is available , while a comprehensive review is carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of an evolving bat algorithm ( EBA ) with better efficiency .

4 Gza ( 11511210 ) was a Hungarian royal prince and the youngest son of the King Gza II of Hungary . Prince Gza was brother to the Kings Stephen III and Bla III of Hungary . He traveled to the Holy Land during the Third Crusade with an army of 2,000 Hungarian warriors. # Biography # Prince Gza was born in 1151 , the fourth son of King Gza II of Hungary and his wife , Princess Euphrosyne of Kiev . After King Gza II died , there were several conflicts over the royal succession . Two brothers of King Gza II briefly seized the crown , reigning as Ladislaus II and Stephen IV of Hungary . The prince 's elder brother was crowned Stephen III of Hungary after defeating his uncle in battle . During the reign of Stephen III , the wars against the Byzantine empire continued . Byzantine emperor , Manuel I Komnenos , had previously competed with Gza II on many occasions , as he was determined to expand his influence over Hungary . Manuel I 's mother was Saint Piroska of Hungary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had a great interest in the internal affairs of Hungary . Manuel I and Stephen III eventually resolved this through a peace accord signed in 1163 , in which the Hungarian King 's younger brother Bla , was to be sent to Constantinople in surety . During Stephen III 's rule , he kept his mother Euphrosyne , and his youngest brother , Prince Gza , at court . After Stephen III 's death in 1172 , his next eldest brother , Prince Bla , was recalled from Constantinople to ascend the throne and forestall any attempt at accession by his younger brother , Prince Gza . Within a few months , he was crowned Bla III of Hungary but faced opposition from his own mother , the Queen Dowager , and his brother , Prince Gza , who began conspiring against him to obtain the Crown of Hungary . After a couple of failed attempts , Bla III had them arrested . He imprisoned his mother , but Prince Gza fled to Leopold V , Duke of Austria to seek protection , whereupon the Austrian duke returned him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Prince Gza escaped once more , fleeing to Bohemia , but Sobslav II , Duke of Bohemia , also returned him to Bla III who imprisoned him again . Prince Gza languished in prison from 1177 to 1189 . Freedom arrived for him in 1189 due to preparations for the Third Crusade . That year , Frederick I , Holy Roman Emperor , arrived in Hungary and was received by King Bla III . Learning of Prince Gza 's predicament , the German emperor asked Bla III to allow the imprisoned Gza to lead a small Hungarian army to the Crusade as an escort . Bla III allowed this , and 2000 Hungarian soldiers left for the Holy Land . After the Third Crusade , and the death of the German emperor , Bla III ordered Gza and his men to return to Hungary , but the Prince and his guard decided to remain in the Holy Land . It is known that Gza took a Byzantine noblewoman as wife between 1190 and 1191 . He had two sons by Princess Irene ( descendant of Piroska ) : Geza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is the ancestor of the Rubempre family , and Istvan ( Stephen ) who served on a crusade with Saint Louis IX of France in 1248 . Stephen had a son , Andrew , a crusading knight based in Venice . Andrew and his sons Felix ( ancestor of the Crouy-Chanel family ) and Mark settled in France . Mark married Catherine Croy-Airaines , heiress to the Croy barony . From this union sprang the Croy family which is still extant . While Prince Gza of Hungary did not succeed in becoming King of Hungary , his grandson Felix ( son of Andrew ) claimed the throne of Hungary in October and November of 1290 . In addition , through the male posterity of Prince Gza ( Ioannes/John ) the rpd dynasty 's male line survives . Historians estimate that Gza died about 1210 because that was the last time he was mentioned by medieval chronicles. # Sources #

4 The 30 foot surf rescue boat is a lifeboat that the United States Coast Guard has used in recent years . The 30 ' long boat is designated the surf rescue boat ( SRB ) and was introduced in 1983. # Design # The 30 ' SRB was self-righting and self baling and designed with marked differences from the typical lifeboats used by the Coast Guard up until the early 1980s . The 30 ' SRB is not considered to be a Motor Lifeboat ( MLB ) , but was generally used in a similar capacity . Designed to perform search and rescue in adverse weather and surf the first 30 ' SRB was built by the Willard Boat Company in Fountain Valley , California . Much of the 30 footer 's design centered around speed . The sides of the hull are made of 5/8 airex foam cored fiberglass reinforced plastic ( FRP ) , and the bottom of the hull is constructed of solid FRP molded in one piece . The boat is 30 ' 4 in length with a 9 ' 4 beam , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear and engine . The 30 footer has a single Detroit Diesel 6V92TI engine , configured by Johnson Towers rated at . The throttles are manually controlled , and the boat has a single screw and rudder . The 30 ' SRB 's were rated for a top speed of 31 kn although most of the hulls fell prey to minor water intrusion into the FRP , which slowed most of the boats to around 28 kn at max RPM . The 30 footer has a range of 130nmi km , and most standard operating procedures dictate that the boat not go more than 20 nmi offshore without a waiver granted from higher level commands . The fuel capacity is 78 gallons at 100% , and the vessel is generally operated with a crew of two , a surfman and an engineer . The crew both stand on the coxswain flat , protected by the superstructure on the bow and stern . The boat 's appearance has caused many to comment that it looks like a Nike Tennis Shoe . # Uses # The intent for the boat is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on scene quickly , get into a surf zone and extract any persons in the water , or to stabilize a situation until the slower and larger motor lifeboat can get on scene . Since 1997 and the introduction of the faster 47 ' MLB and the phasing out of the 44 ' MLBs the need for a quick response vessel diminished making the 30 footers obsolete . The class of vessels underwent an overhaul in the early nineties to extend their life until the newer and faster 47 ' motor lifeboats came into service and in the late 1990s most of the 30 footers were de-commissioned . One still remains on active duty at Motor Lifeboat Station Depoe Bay in Depoe Bay , Oregon and is used almost daily . This station was host to the last 36 ' motor lifeboat in the late 1980s .

514 A graduate tax is a proposed method of financing higher education . It has been proposed in the United Kingdom and Ireland . # Background # Under the Higher Education Act 2004 British and European Union students at publicly funded universities in England , Wales and Northern Ireland are charged tuition fees ( called top-up fees ) directly by the universities . The amount of the fees is limited by law and the fees can be funded by government-backed student loans issued by a government-backed company . The loans need only be repaid when the graduate is earning a sufficient amount of money to do so . Non-EU students can be charged an unlimited fee by the universities , and these are usually considerably higher . In 2009 the National Union of Students ( NUS ) proposed a tax on graduates who have received academic degrees over a period of years after the granting of the degree . Four of the five candidates running in the British Labour Party 's leadership election in 2010 also backed the proposal . A graduate tax was mooted before the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected . A system of graduate tax was seriously considered as part of the Browne Review although Vince Cable has stated that No decisions have been made . On 15 July 2010 Vince Cable appeared to endorse a graduate tax , saying in a speech that he was interested in looking at the feasibility of changing the system of financing student tuition so that the repayment mechanism is variable graduate contributions tied to earnings . # NUS proposal # The National Union of Students has proposed a tax that would be levied on graduates for 20 years following their graduation , progressively ranging from 0.3% to 2.5% of their income . # Benefits # A graduate tax would allow education to be free at the point of delivery . Proponents claim that one benefit of a graduate tax is that it would prevent a market in higher education developing whereby students chose where and what to study based upon the ability to pay rather than academic ability . A graduate tax might raise more money for universities over the long term than capped tuition fees , depending on the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate tax admits that an obvious attraction of such a tax is that it is levied only on graduates , the immediate beneficiaries of higher education . Under the NUS 's proposals a ' People 's Trust ' would be set up that would be independent of the Treasury . The current system of loans has been seen as unviable because they require an expensive public subsidy to universities . David Willets has described how a rise in tuition fees would increase public spending : It is in such delicate equilibrium that shifting any single element requires us to shift everything else . If fees were to go up , the government would have to lend people the money to pay for them - and that would push up public spending .... It 's not just that students do n't want to pay higher fees : the Treasury ca n't afford them . So the arrangements we have now are clearly unable to respond to the current economic climate . A graduate tax may not be perceived to be a debt in the same way as a student loan is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that students carry an additional fixed burden of debt into their working lives . Yet , most of us do nt think of our future tax obligations as ' debt ' . The UK Youth Parliament , funded by the British Youth Council , supports the abolition of tuition fees with a view to introducing a graduate tax . In November 2011 at their annual House of Commons debate , former Member of UK Youth Parliament Harrison Carter spoke of the benefits of the tax at the Government Despatch box . He contended that the tax would go straight to universities , bypassing the HM Treasury . He dubbed others naive for not wanting to give something back for an education they would ultimately benefit from . Carter spoke of the country 's duty to educate its citizens . He said we were failing in that duty because the debt from University , for many , makes it an impractical next step . # Criticisms # The graduate tax could create several perverse incentives . For example , graduates of UK universities would have an incentive to move away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or impossible to collect the graduate tax . The Russell group of universities claims that this could deprive the UK of vital skills and knowledge . Further perverse incentives may be present , depending on the details of how the scheme is implemented . If the tax is levied only upon students who graduate , then some students would have an incentive not to graduate after having completed their courses of study . If the tax is levied only upon students who graduate from UK institutions , then some students would have an incentive to transfer from UK universities to foreign institutions for their final year(s) of study . A graduate tax breaks the link between the actual cost of a degree and the amount the graduate pays for it . Some graduates would end up paying more in taxes than their degrees actually cost , while others would pay less . The Russell Group claims that this situation would be unreasonable and likely to be seen by many as unfair . Because individual universities will not derive any direct financial benefit from becoming more attractive to students , the graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive up quality according to the Russell Group . Criticisms include the transitional problems which exist where students are going through university but not paying the tax . Free-market thinkers have criticised the graduate tax for not creating a market based element in higher education . Alistair Jarvis of the 1994 Group of research universities has stated : Any mechanism that prevents variable fees and the functioning of a regulated market would be damaging to the sector ... We strongly support a regulated market because this is the best way to drive up excellence in research and teaching , and to deliver student satisfaction . A system of variable fees has been , and remains , the correct strategy . This system should be developed , rather than fundamentally changed . It has also been argued by ' ' The Independent ' ' that it is too early to change the system again in the United Kingdom . Greenaway argues that a graduate tax would not deliver additional resources rapidly and that there is a potential problem of ' leakage ' with EU nationals leaving the UK and therefore not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russell Group Vice-Chancellors as it would likely result in a more equitable distribution of research funding towards less prestigious universities . Nicholas Barr , professor of public economics at the London School of Economics has praised the current system of student loans as a method of financing higher education , arguing that variable fees foster competition that is of benefit to both students and employers . Another problem concerns how foreign students at UK universities and emigrants from Britain would be treated by the tax . Madsen Pirie of the free-market Adam Smith Institute , writing in ' ' The Daily Telegraph ' ' , argues that it is wrong for talented graduates to face higher taxes under a form of progressive taxation and that such a proposal might make emigration more appealing to graduates . A loan can also be paid off early whereas a tax would continue to be charged for a longer period of time . The Universities and Colleges Union , a supporter of free higher education has criticised a graduate tax . Sally Hunt has criticised the tax as a rise in fees by stealth : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach a rise in university fees . If the Government thinks it can get the public to swallow higher fees as some sort of graduate tax , it is living in a dream world . We need a proper debate on how to fund our universities , not an exercise in rebranding . We will judge the plans on what they actually do and whether or not students will be forced to pay more , not how the Government markets them . # Ireland # A graduate tax has also been proposed in Ireland . Since 1995 , the ' ' Free Fees Initiative ' ' has meant that almost all students in the Republic of Ireland from the European Economic Area and Switzerland do not have to pay fees , with the government paying them on their behalf . However , they must pay a ' ' student contribution ' ' ( formally called the ' ' student services charge ' ' and informally known as the ' ' registration charge ' ' ) , which for the academic year 2010/11 was set at a maximum rate of 2,000 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many students from lower-income families can get grants to cover this and other costs ( such as academic field trips ) , as well as a maintenance grant . In March 2009 Fine Gael , then the largest opposition party in Dil ireann , proposed a graduate contribution scheme to replace the current system . In its policy document ' ' The Third Way ' ' it proposed a system that would be automatic and universal ( applying to all graduates regardless of wealth ) , and would amount to 30 per cent of the total cost of their third-level education . The party also proposed to abolish the student contribution so that education would be free at the point of delivery . The contribution would be collected via the PRSI system and would be ring-fenced for third-level education . There would be no interest charged on the contribution and it would not be retrospective . There would be a minimum rate of repayment set by the State , but graduates could increase the amounts repaid if they wished . The scheme appeared in Fine Gael 's 2011 general election manifesto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Labour following the election , they committed to undertake a full review of the Hunt and OECD reports into third-level funding before the end of 2011 . They said that their goal is to introduce a funding system that will provide third-level institutions with reliable funding but does not impact access for students . In December 2011 , in the run-up to Budget 2012 , the Department of Education examined a number of models of funding for third-level education , including a return to fees , a student loan system ( similar to the UK 's or New Zealand 's ) and a graduate tax .

4 Order of Ennead are an American self-described ' philosophical virtuoso death metal ' Order of Ennead have released two albums to date . # History # Order Of Ennead was formed in the fall of 1997 under the banner of the now defunct Council Of The Fallen . Following Kevin Quirions hiatus from Council Of The Fallen in 2006 , and , with Deicide on hitaus , in late 2006 , Scott Patrick began jamming with Steve Asheim on a more straight forward rock project . In the summer of 2007 , Scott played the preproduction for the next Council album for Steve , relaying that Derek Roddy had exited earlier the previous year and that the material was top notch but called for a high caliber drummer to step up . With Steve interested , Scott met with Kevin at a Vital Remains show and relayed that Steve would like to jam the preproduction songs . In September 2007 , the trio had their first practice . In late 2007 , Scotts long time friend Santiago Dobles performed the leads for the demo , which would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of the demo exist ) . Following their signing to Earache Records in early 2008 , Santiago Dobles was replaced with Scotts friend John Li ( who ironically jammed with Council in 2006 ) due to scheduling conflicts with Santiagos primary act Aghora ( band ) While in the United Kingdom , Asheim was reading up on ancient mythology and suggested the name Ennead from a mythology of nine Egyptian deities . In November 2008 , the band released their self-titled debut album , with their second album , ' ' An Examination of Being ' ' , released in May 2010 , both to warm critical reception and both on the Earache Records label . When John Li is not available for touring , guitarist Jack Owen , the current lead guitarist of Deicide , takes over . # Music # Order of Ennead are noted for their experimental nature within their songwriting .

4 St. Scholastica 's Abbey , also known as Subiaco Abbey ( Italian : ' ' Abbazia di Santa Scolastica ' ' ) , in Subiaco , Latium , Italy , is a Benedictine territorial abbey founded in the 6th century AD by Saint Benedict of Nursia . It was in one of the Subiaco caves that Benedict made his first hermitage . The monastery today gives its name to the Subiaco Congregation , a grouping of monasteries worldwide that makes up part of the Order of Saint Benedict . # History # In the early 6th century Benedict of Nursia , a man from a well-to-do family who was educated at Rome , retired to an ancient Roman villa in a grotto in Subiaco , in the mountains of north Latium . His reputation as a spiritual guide quickly drew disciples to him there , including many of his old Roman friends , who also settled in the area . Over the years , no fewer than thirteen monastic communities arose around Subiaco , including the one that would come to be named for St. Scholastica , Benedict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater solitude , Benedict would retire to Monte Cassino , where the same process would be repeated . In the ninth century , St. Scholastica 's Abbey was twice destroyed by the Saracens , in 828-829 and 876-877 . But it was restored , and grew in the tenth century thanks to the patronage and favour of several popes , many of whom were , in fact , Benedictine monks . As for monastic establishments throughout Europe , the eleventh and twelfth centuries were a golden age for the abbey , when it boasted vast lands , a large number of monks , and elaborate , ornate liturgy . With economic power came political power as well . In the thirteenth century , a sanctuary was erected over the cave where St. Benedict had dwelt , the ' ' Sacro Speco ' ' or Holy Cave . Riches also brought covetousness , and the abbey 's prestige brought it enemies . Long power struggles with the feudal establishment weakened the abbey , and decedence set in when Calixtus III made Juan de Torquemada ( uncle of the famous inquisitor ) commendatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled it . Rodrigo Borgia ( later the infamous Alexander VI held the commendatory abbacy in 1467 . The Colonna ( 1492 ) , Borghese ( 1608 ) , and Barberini ( 1633 ) families would also gain control of its revenues . Some took their ownership of the abbey seriously and tried to restore it , but most were content to exploit its revenues , sometimes without even ever visiting the monastery . The spiritual well-being of the monks was rarely a concern . The tide began to turn in 1753 , when Benedict XIV decided to remove commendatory abbots ' power over the day-to-day running of their monasteries , leaving them only the spiritual and ecclesiastical dignity . Yet at the end of the century , when the French occupied the Papal States , the abbey was suppressed . Pius VII restored it as soon as he regained his independence . In 1915 , Benedict XV accorded it the privilege of a territorial abbey . # Today # The monastic community today is made up of a little over twenty monks , including eleven priest-monks , living in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monks ) , and the ' ' Sacro Speco ' ' ( ' ' Holy Cave ' ' ) , the sanctuary to , which can also be visited by pilgrims . # St. Scholastica 's Abbey # * The buildings are arranged around three cloisters .

4 The SogaMononobe conflict was a political and military dispute that took place in Japan during the Asuka Period between the pro-Shinto Mononobe clan , led by Mononobe no Moriya , and the pro-Buddhist Soga clan , led by Soga no Umako , which would eventually emerge victorious in the year 587 AD. # Background # # Battle at Mount Shigi # Although the circumstances under which the fighting took place are extremely murky , Takeshi Umehara notes that some ancient and medieval accounts say that the decisive battle took place in July of 587 near Mount Shigi . Between July 1st and 2nd the Soga are said to have been defeated in a series of engagements with the Mononobe , who , according to the ' ' Nihon Shoki ' ' , employed a type of fortification called an ' ' inaki ' ' , a palisade constructed from bundles of rice plants . The Soga gradually retreated westward and by July 3rd the demoralized Soga troops had finally concentrated in the area between Mount Shigi and Mount Ikoma . Legend has it that at this point Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fashioned it into an image of the Four Heavenly Kings of Buddhism , and placed it on his forehead . Shotoku and Soga no Umako then both openly vowed to build a temple to the Four Heavenly Kings should they be victorious in the battle , which reenergized their men prior to the final confrontation . In this final battle the turning point came when a Soga archer , named by the ' ' Nihon Shoki ' ' as one Tomi no Obito Ichii , fired the arrow which killed Mononobe clan leader Mononobe no Moriya , after which his forces were quickly routed . The Mononobe clan , the most powerful opponent of Buddhism , was practically exterminated in the battle . Shotoku has traditionally been credited with the founding of two temples which he is said to have had constructed following the battle : Shitennoji and Shigisan Temple . # Notes # The name of Mount Shigi where the battle took place has been written as both ' ' Shigisan ' ' and ' ' Shigisen ' ' and for this reason the battle has been referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

4 birthplace = Copenhagen , Denmark Dr. Hinrich Johannes Rink ( first name sometimes as Henrik ) ( 26 August 1819 15 December 1893 ) was a Danish geologist , one of the pioneers of glaciology , and the first accurate describer of the inland ice of Greenland . Rink , who first came to Greenland in 1848 , spent 16 winters and 22 summers in the Arctic region , and became notable for Greenland 's development . Becoming a Greenlandic scholar and administrator , he served as Royal Inspector of South Greenland and went on to became Director of the Royal Greenland Trading Department . With Forstanderskaber , Rink introduced the first steps towards Greelandic home rule . the first systematic collection of Greenlandic oral tradition stories . He was the founder of ' ' Atuagagdliutit ' ' , the first Kalaallisut language newspaper . # Early years # Rink was born in Copenhagen to Holstein parents .

For a time , he served as Assistant Professor under William Christopher Zeise . He graduated with a Ph.D . from the University of Copenhagen . Rink studied medicine during the winter of 184445 , taking an anatomy course and listening to lectures in Berlin . He was often depressed and vacillated with regard to his future . # Career # At the suggestion of Hans Christian rsted , it was in Berlin that he received an offer to participate as a mineralogist for the first of the Galathea expeditions aboard the frigate ' ' Galathea ' ' . The voyage lasted from 1845 through 1847 . He was intent on going to Calcutta , but he ended up at the Nicobar Islands , colonized by Denmark at the time , to investigate them geographically . After five months he fell ill with Nicobar Fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing his return to Denmark . On the return trip , he stopped in Cairo and Malta , where , in October 1846 , he collected geological materials . In 1847 , his first major geographical work , The Nicobarese islands , was published . From 1848 until 1851 , with public support , he went to Western Greenland for geological and glaciological studies at Upernavik and Umanak . Here , he lived among the Kalaallit which gave him an opportunity to study them . But his objective was to create a map of Greenland based on the surveys that he performed and those of others . He was able to survey large areas of Western Greenland 's fjords and their glaciers . In the last year , he spent some time in Ilulissat and sailed to Paakitsoq , a bay in Western Greenland . He travelled by sledge to Sermeq Kujalleq in the spring of 1851 . He mapped the Greenland coast , and made the first geological map of it . Rink 's surveys are notable as the first in a series of ice margin change surveys that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1851 where he took a seat in a Commission that dealt with the trade monopoly in Greenland . On behalf of the Commission , he went back to Greenland in 1852 , and subsequently published the book ' ' About the monopoly of trade in Greenland ' ' . The following year , he entered the service of the monopoly trade and was the first colonial administrator in Godthaab and Julianehb . He studied the Arctic Ocean ice , its origins , movement and composition and in 1853 , he published his essay , ' ' On the spread and movement of ice over the North Greenland mainland ' ' . From 18571868 , he was a royal inspector of South Greenland . During his years as a civil servant , he published his main work , ' ' Greenland and statistically described geography ' ' , which is the first standard work on Greenland after Hans Egede 's Perlustration of 1729 .

Its first issue was published in January 1861 , and it was published monthly thereafter . In addition to the newspaper , the print shop published pamphlets . Rink actively cared for the welfare of the Inuit , with whom he had close contact . It was his idea and under his guidance , that the Commission 's board members were introduced , which ensured Greenlanders ' influence on their own affairs . In 1858 , he called on local people to learn their artistic traditions . He helped discover and promote the artists Jens Kreutzmann and Aron of Kangeq . Rink studied the Greenlandic language and folklore ; ' ' Eskimo tales and legends ' ' was published in 1866 .

4 ' ' Trapalcotherium ' ' is a fossil mammal from the Cretaceous of Argentina in the family Ferugliotheriidae . The single species , ' ' T. matuastensis ' ' , is known from one tooth , a first lower molar . It is from the Allen Formation , which is probably Maastrichtian in age , and was first described in 2009 . The tooth bears two rows of cusps , one at the inner ( lingual ) side and the other at the outer ( labial ) side , which are connected by transverse ridges separated by deep valleys . This pattern is reminiscent of ' ' Ferugliotherium ' ' , a gondwanathere mammal from similarly aged deposits in Argentina , and ' ' Trapalcotherium ' ' is therefore recognized as a member of the same family Ferugliotheriidae . Ferugliotheriidae is one of two families of gondwanatheres , an enigmatic group without close relationships to any living mammals . # Discovery and context # The only known fossil of ' ' Trapalcotherium ' ' was found at Cerro Tortuga in Ro Negro Province , southern Argentina . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formations ( rock units ) that have yielded Late Cretaceous gondwanathere fossils from Argentina ( the others are the Los Alamitos and La Colonia Formations ) . All three are probably about equally old , from the Maastrichtian ( latest Cretaceous , about 7166 million years ago , mya ) and perhaps partly the Campanian ( 8471 mya ) . The mammals from the Allen Formation are known from seven teeth , six of which represent four species of dryolestoidsa group of primitive mammals that dominates the Late Cretaceous mammalian faunas of Argentina . The fauna was described in a 2009 paper by Guillermo Rougier and colleagues , who named ' ' Trapalcotherium ' ' as well as several new dryolestoids . The generic name , ' ' Trapalcotherium ' ' , combines the name of the basin where Cerro Tortuga is located , Bajo Trapalca , with the Greek ' ' therion ' ' beast , commonly used to mean mammal in scientific names . The specific name , ' ' matuastensis ' ' , derives from Puesto El Matuesto , a shed used by the paleontologists who collected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single tooth of ' ' Trapalcotherium ' ' is identified as a lower molar because it has two longitudinal rows of cusps ; as a first molar because it is longer than wide ; and as a left tooth because the left side ( interpreted as labial , in the direction of the lips ) bears more cusps than the right side ( lingual , the direction of the tongue ) . The tooth is 2.48 mm long and 2.07 mm wide . Part of the back labial corner is missing . The lingual row contains three cusps and the labial probably five ( the broken corner renders the number uncertain ) . Transverse ridges , separated by deep valleys , connect the lingual and labial cusps ; therefore , the cusps are not strongly separate , but rather fused . The lingual cusps are larger and separated by larger valleys than the labial ones . At the front of the tooth is a triangular structure consisting of the first lingual and the first two labial cusps . A low crest connects the first lingual to the first labial cusp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively shallow valley , connects the second lingual to the first labial cusp . Behind this structure , a second triangle is formed by two crests passing from the second lingual cusp to two cusps at the labial side ( the back of the two is broken away , but its existence is presumed from the crown pattern ) . The front of these two crests is interrupted by a groove . The third lingual cusp is also connected to two crests , which encircle a small depression and presumably connected to one or more labial cusps , which are missing from the fossil . # Relationships # ' ' Trapalcotherium ' ' is identified as a member of Gondwanatheriaa small and enigmatic group of mammals from Cretaceous and Paleogene of the southern continents ( Gondwana ) on the basis of the transverse ridges and triangle on its crown . It resembles ' ' Ferugliotherium ' ' from the Los Alamitos Formation , the only previously known uncontroversial member of the family Ferugliotheriidae , but differs in some characters : the triangle at the front is narrower in ' ' Trapalcotherium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less curved ; the ridges attached to the second lingual cusp form another triangle ; the tooth is relatively shorter ; ' ' Trapalcotherium ' ' does not have the Y-shaped valleys between cusps seen in ' ' Ferugliotherium ' ' ; and the tips of the lingual cusps are more labially placed . The evolutionary affinities of gondwanatheres , which include the Ferugliotheriidae and the higher-crowned Sudamericidae , are controversial , though a relationship with multituberculates ( a large group mainly known from the northern continents of Laurasia ) has repeatedly been proposed ; the identification of ' ' Trapalcotherium ' ' does not provide additional information that has a bearing on the relationships of the gondwanatheres. 
4 The United States Polo Association ( USPA ) is the national governing body for the sport of polo in the United States . # Introduction # Established in 1890 , the USPA provides resources to over 4,500 individual members and 250 polo clubs across the U.S. and Canada , including promoting the game of polo , coordinating the activities of its Member Clubs and Registered Players , arranging and supervising polo tournaments , competitions and games and providing rules , handicaps and conditions for those tournaments , competitions and games , including the safety and welfare of participants and mounts .

In 2010 , the USPA created Team USPA , a program to enhance and grow the sport of polo in the U.S. by identifying young , talented American players and providing mentored training and playing opportunities leading to a pool of higher rated amateur and professional players . The organization also coordinates youth polo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 2012 , 60 Minutes aired a special feature on polos resurgence in America and included several interviews with dedicated players and ambassadors in the United States . The segment highlighted one of the USPAs specialty programs , Work to Ride , which is dedicated to helping inner-city youth in Philadelphia through polo and other equine activities . # Brand # The U.S. Polo Assn. brand is the official brand of the USPA .

It was first played in the United States in 1876 , introduced by James Gordon Bennett , Jr . ( May 10 , 1841 May 14 , 1918 ) , who had first observed the game played in England . Bennett came to be known as father of American polo as it was he who assembled the players , knowledge , equipment and Texas horses to play the first loosely structured matches in the United States . During that winter of 1876 , the first game was held indoors at Dickels Riding Academy in New York and the first formal U.S. club was established , the Westchester Polo Club . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhode Island before making Newport its permanent home . On May 13 , 1876 , the Jerome Park Racetrack in Westchester County ( future home of the New York Giants baseball team and hence the name polo grounds ) was the site of the first outdoor polo match . Then in 1879 Meadowbrook became a polo club and began play on the Mineola fairgrounds of Long Island . The foundation had now been laid for American polo and the sport was here to stay and flourish . As players and teams proliferated , the development of the sport demanded a governing body . The Polo Association ( later known as the United States Polo Association ) , with H.L. Herbert serving as first chairman , was founded March 21 , 1890 . The USPAs purpose was to coordinate games , standardize rules and establish handicaps . Mr. Herbert was credited with instituting a handicapping system in 1888 so that teams could be more evenly matched in games . His rating system is essentially the same today , with player handicaps spanning minus one through 10 , with 10 being highest handicap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant , continued to guide the Association until 1921 . Hazard then followed as USPA Chairman until 1922 . The first USPA headquarters was appropriately located in New York , the center of polo at that time . The Association began operations on a voluntary basis of committee structure and continues as such today with a small office staff . Elected Officers and Governors serve annually along with appointed Committee Members . USPA membership originally included seven clubs and , the following year , 142 players registered and there were five new clubs . In its early days of organization , the Association initiated changes in the number and length of time periods ( chukkers ) in a match . Equipment became standardized and pony training improved significantly . Scoring was also adjusted to allow for fractioning of points for penaltieslater abolished as an unnecessarily complex method of scoring that was replaced with free shots . Even before the Association was formed the Westchester Cup , one of the oldest tournaments in the world , was contested in 1886 by the United States and Britain . This prestigious international polo tournament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wimbledon and the British Open were all new events in a sparse sporting calendar . Though the British won that first match at Westchester easily , the Americans would use the defeat as a catalyst to improve their game strategy and the quality of their horses . The Association continued the series and the United States won nine of the next eleven matches including the 1939 competition , when the tournament was played for the last time at Meadowbrook before a crowd of 40,000 . The Cup was not played again until 1988 , when the United States defeated an Australasian team in Lexington , Kentucky . The U.S. won again against England in 1992 and later lost to the British in 1997 . In 1904 another important tournament evolved , the United States Open . The first Open was won by the Wanderers , who scored 4-1/2 to the Freebooters 3 . The tournament resumed in 1910 and continued every year with the exception of 1911 , 1915 , 1917 , 1918 , and 1942-1945 . The U.S. Open Polo Championship would become polos most prestigious tournament still played annually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach , Florida . The excitement of the sport was contagious ; many of the early polo matches in the 1920s and 1930s attracted as many as 20,000 spectators . This would be an impressive attendance even by todays standards , yet when one considers the communication and transportation capabilities of that era it was truly incredible . The center of much of this excitement was Meadowbrook Polo Club in Westbury , NY , the site of many of the first U.S. Open and Westchester Cup Championships . During the 1913-14 , the Westchester Cup packed 20,000 spectators into the stands . Even as polo gained in popularity across the country , eventually extending west to Texas , California and Hawaii , Meadowbrook would dominate the sport and be the center of polo during the first half of the century . During these early years of the USPA , one of the more famous players in polo was Foxhall Keene , handicapped for 14 years at 10 goals , and then 16 years at 9 goals . Though there were many other greats , four players stood out in the 1890s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Waterbury brothers , Larry and Monty and Devereux Milburn . These four players were known as the original Big Four and won the Westchester Cup in 1909 , 1911 , and 1913 . Milburn would go on to play in seven international matches and established a reputation as one of the most outstanding players of all time . Credited with creating and leading the Big Four , Harry Payne Whitney played a pivotal role in the sport by helping develop a more fluid open form of play integrating better teamwork . By 1913 , Circuit Cup play began with the first USPA Inter-circuit Cup held in 1916 . The USPA claimed 1,407 members and began registration of the ponies as well though pony registration would later be dropped in the 1920s . College polo came of age and indoor polo grew in popularity championed by George Sherman and Robert A. Graviss . Contributing to the growth of polo during this period was the U.S. Army , who after joining the USPA in 1902 , encouraged their members to participate in polo to improve their riding ability . From that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant role in growing and sustaining the sport of polo by adding significant numbers of players and polo ponies . Polos greatest era began in the years between the first and second World Wars . The sport not only survived the Great Depression , but expanded into the 1930s with increased international competition . The number of registered clubs had increased to 88 and playing membership was 2,889 , of which 1,276 were military players . Louis Stoddard , a ten-goal player and member of two Westchester Cup Championship teams served as Chairman from 1922 to 1936 . He would direct and expand the USPA during the period of great change . Other great names in polo emerged , such as ten-goaler Tommy Hitchcock , Jr. , who reigned for 20 years and captured Americas hearts . Both of Hitchcocks parents were strong supporters of polo ; his mother taught young children the game and coached many polo players to greatness . Thomas Hitchcock , Sr. was also an outstanding player who was rated at ten goals in 1891 . By 1928 , another international match , The Cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. and Argentina . The U.S. Team won the first two competitions ; however , from 1936 , Argentina would go on to be the victor in future matches . The 1930s also saw women creating an impact on the sport , though they would not become official USPA members for years to come . During polos heyday it was only fitting that Hollywood would become involved with this great sport . With a wonderful climate for the game and the appeal for movie stars and moguls , California polo expanded . The geographic spread of polo led to the first East-West match up in 1933 , with the West winning two of three matches , proving the Westerners were a force with which to be reckoned . Humorist Will Rogers , a talented player and supporter of polo was thrilled . He is still remembered today as saying , The hillbillies beat the dudes and took the polo championship right out of the drawing room and into the bunkhouse . The Great Depression eventually took its toll on the fabric of American society and polo , like most things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , the number of civilian players dropped from 1600 to 750 . Though the number of military players peaked in 1940 with 1,432 registered members , Army polo would later disappear as the mechanization of the era outmoded the need for the cavalry . From 1942-1945 USPA tournaments were not played , though polo continued on private fields . Chairman , R.E . Strawbridge , Jr. , headed the Association from 1936-1940 , followed by Elbridge T. Gerry to 1946 and then Strawbridge served again from 1946-1950 . Polo survived after the war , thanks in great part to Cecil Smith of Plano , Texas , considered one of the first professional or paid players . By 1950 , the number of active clubs was 56 with 614 USPA playing members . Devereux Milburn , Jr. , son of the great 10-goal star , served as Chairman of the Association from 1950 to 1960 . The early 50s also marked the closing of Meadowbrook to make way for a highway ; Meadowbrook relocated to Jericho , Long Island . The club would never regain its earlier dominance . A new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the first U.S. Open was played there in the 1950s , the ascent of Oak Brook began and continued as American interest in polo revived during the 1960s . USPA clubs increased to 77 and 675 players were registered . The Indoor Polo Association combined with the USPA in 1954 . Indoor polo , also known as arena polo - expanded the scope of the sport and intercollegiate polo made a comeback with George C. Sherman , Jr . serving as USPA Chairman from 1960 to 1966 . In 1967 the USPA moved its headquarters from New York to Oak Brook , the new home of American polo . This era also marked the introduction of sponsor money for horses and professional players . With the help of William T. Ylvisaker , the Polo Training Foundation was established in 1967 for the purpose of raising donations for the purposes of teaching polo fundamentals and improving the sport . In 1970 the Association listed 100 clubs and 917 registered players . Northrup R.

Polo flourished in Florida , encouraged by John T. Oxleys interest in high-goal polo and William T. Ylvisakers promotion of the sport by courting corporate sponsorship . International play increased as the Camacho Cup , played at Juarez , Mexico , was revived . Norman Brinker closed out the decade as USPA Chairman from 1976 to 1980 . Polo evolved from a society sport to include a far broader base of budget-minded horsemen , professional players and commercial sponsorship . With William Sinclaire as Chairman in 1980 , the USPA registered 134 clubs and almost 1,400 players . Sinclaire was followed by S.K. Johnston , Jr . as Chairman from 1984 to 1988 who oversaw the move of the USPA offices to Lexington , KY . With the dominance of Oak Brook fading , the polo centers of the 1980s grew to include Florida , Texas and California .

4 The higher education bubble is a hypothesis that there is a speculative boom and bust phenomenon in the field of higher education , particularly in the United States , and that there is the risk of an economic bubble in higher education that could have repercussions in the broader economy . Enrollment at more than 40 percent of private colleges and universities declined during 2012 , forcing the institutions to offer steep tuition discounts to fill seats . President Obama nearly doubled the federal Pell Grant Program , from $19 billion in 2009 to $36 billion for 2013. and the soundness of the student loan industry may be threatened by increasing default rates . College students who fail to find employment at the level needed to pay back their loans in a reasonable amount of time have been compared to the debtors under sub-prime mortgages whose homes are worth less than what is owed to the bank . # Discussion # Benjamin Ginsberg explains the connection between the increased ability to pay tuition and the increase in services provided in his book ' ' The Fall of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been new sorts of demands for administrative services that require more managers per student or faculty member than was true in the past . The Goldwater Institute echoes this sentiment with its findings that , Between 1993 and 2007 , the number of full-time administrators per 100 students at Americas leading universities grew by 39 percent , while the number of employees engaged in teaching , research or service only grew by 18 percent . As discussed below , the higher education bubble is controversial and has been rejected by some economists . Indeed , many Americans still believe in the value of a college education , although they are unsure about its quality and affordability . Data shows that the wage premiumthe difference between what those with a four-year college degree earn and what those with only a high school education earnhas increased dramatically since the 1970s , but so has the ' debt load ' incurred by students due to the tuition inflation . Michael Simkovic , ( 2012 ) The data also suggests that , notwithstanding a slight increase in 20082009 , student loan default rates have declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are much less likely than those without to be unemployed , even though they are more expensive to employ ( they earn higher wages ) . The global management consulting firm McKinsey and Company projects a shortage of college trained workers , and an excess supply of workers without college degrees , which would cause the wage premium to increase , and cause differences in unemployment rates to become even more dramatic . In 1971 , ' ' Time ' ' ran an article Education : Graduates and Jobs : A Grave New World , which stated that the supply of post-graduate students was around twice larger than the expected future demand in upcoming decades . In 1987 , U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett first suggested that the availability of loans may in fact be fueling an increase in tuition prices and an education bubble . This Bennett hypothesis claims that readily available loans allow schools to increase tuition prices without regard to demand elasticity . College rankings are partially driven by spending levels , and higher tuition prices are correlated with increased public perceptions of . Over the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provided more resources to students . Additionally , schools tend to enroll fewer students as they improve student offerings and increase prices . This suggests that it is in schools ' best interest to increase tuition prices as much as possible , so long as financial aid ensures an ability to pay on the part of students and parents . A variation on the higher education bubble theory suggests that there is no general bubble in higher educationthat is , on average , higher education really does boost income and employment by more than enough to make it a good investmentbut that degrees in some specific fields may be overvalued because they do little to boost income or improve job prospects , while degrees in other fields may in fact be ' ' undervalued ' ' because students do not appreciate the extent to which these degrees could benefit their employment prospects and future income . Proponents of this theory have noted that schools charge equal prices for tuition regardless of what students study , the interest rate on federal student loans is not adjusted according to risk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of college are not very good at predicting future wages by major . A 2011 article in ' ' The Huffington Post ' ' related concern that new college graduates hiring rates are up by 10 percent and that attaining a secondary level education eventually pays off . It is also suggested that high school graduates are three times more likely to live in poverty than students with higher education degrees . A recent study from the Labor Department suggests that attaining a bachelor 's degree represents a significant advantage in the job market . However , the article also claims that those who only have a high school educationunemployment is slightly higher at a rate of 9.3 percent . The proponents of the article also claim that companies are most likely to hire an applicant straight from college rather than one who has been unemployed . A 2010 article in the ' ' The Christian Science Monitor ' ' suggest ten main benefits of obtaining a degree via higher education . Also suggesting that a college degree pays off financially and intangibly for the graduate , and overall for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Higher Education ' ' ran an article concerning that the future is bright for college graduates and expected to improve . A rapid 10% increase is anticipated for new bachelor 's hires . A survey conducted by ' ' The Chronicle of Higher Education ' ' suggests that 40 percent of 3,300 employers plan to hire graduates from all fields of study . The survey suggested stability in the upcoming job market . A 2009 article in ' ' The Chronicle of Higher Education ' ' related concern from parents wondering whether it is worth the price to send their children to college . ' ' The Economist ' ' in turn hypothesized that the bubble bursting may make it harder for colleges to fill their classes , and that some building projects will come to a halt . The ' ' Boston Herald ' ' further suggested the possibility of mergers , closures and even bankruptcies of smaller colleges that have spent too much and taken on too much debt . ' ' National Review ' ' writer Dan Lips has proposed that the bubble 's bursting may bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Washington Examiner ' ' that those who have financed their educations with debt may be particularly hard-hit . Reynolds continued arguing his case in The Higher Education Bubble where he noted that higher education , as a product grows more and more elaborate-- and more expensive-- but the expense is offset by cheap credit provided by sellers who are eager to encourage buyers to buy . Further speculation as to the higher education bubble was the focus of a series of articles in ' ' The Economist ' ' in 2011. # Controversy # The view that higher education is a bubble is controversial . Most economists do not think the returns to college education are fallingin fact , the data suggests the rate of return is increasing . In a financial bubble , assets like houses are sometimes purchased with a view to reselling at a higher price , and this can produce rapidly escalating prices as people speculate on future prices . An end to the spiral can provoke abrupt selling of the assets , resulting in an abrupt collapse in price the bursting of the bubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education can not be sold ( only rented through wages ) , there is no similar mechanism that would cause an abrupt collapse in the value of existing degrees . For this reason , many people find this analogy misleading . However , one rebuttal to the claims that a bubble analogy is misleading is the observation that the ' bursting ' of the bubble are the negative effects on students who incur student debt , for example , as the American Association of State Colleges and Universities reports that Students are deeper in debt today than ever before ... The trend of heavy debt burdens threatens to limit access to higher education , particularly for low-income and first-generation students , who tend to carry the heaviest debt burden . Federal student aid policy has steadily put resources into student loan programs rather than need-based grants , a trend that straps future generations with high debt burdens . Even students who receive federal grant aid are finding it more difficult to pay for college . In this analogy , the increased inability of students to pay for their debt would represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payers to bail out the government for giving out bad loans -as the ratio of the aggregate debt compared to the aggregate earning potential grows to the tipping point , due to the finite amount of high paying positions , the limiting factor in this analogy . However , the data actually show that , notwithstanding a slight increase in 20082009 , student loan default rates have declined since the mid-1980s and 1990s . And even during the recession , those with college degrees are much less likely than those without to be unemployed , even though they earn higher wages . Ohio University economist Richard Vedder has written in the ' ' Wall Street Journal ' ' that : A key measure of the benefits of a degree is the college graduate 's earning potentialand on this score , their advantage over high-school graduates is deteriorating . Since 2006 , the gap between what the median college graduate earned compared with the median high-school graduate has narrowed by $1,387 for men over 25 working full time , a 5% fall . Women in the same category have fared worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A college degree 's declining value is even more pronounced for younger Americans . According to data collected by the College Board , for those in the 25-34 age range the differential between college graduate and high school graduate earnings fell 11% for men , to $18,303 from $20,623 . The decline for women was an extraordinary 19.7% , to $14,868 from $18,525 . Meanwhile , the cost of college has increased 16.5% in 2012 dollars since 2006 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' higher education tuition-fee index . Critics have also pointed to possible conflicts of interest and political biases because professor Vedder accepts funding from right wing political organizations . Some like Michael Wenisch , of Georgetown University , calls the education bubble a student loan bubble and have suggested that without the continuing growth of the student loan bubble , it is foreseeable that many colleges and universities will be forced to declare bankruptcy and cease operations over the next ten years . # Alternatives to bubble theory # A different proposal for the cause of rising tuition is the reduction of state and federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuition . Thus , it is not a bubble , but a form of shifting costs away from state and federal funding over to students . This has mostly applied to public universities which in 2011 for the first time have taken in more in tuition than in state funding , and had the greatest increases in tuition . Implied from this shift away from public funding to tuition is privatization , although ' ' The New York Times ' ' reported that such claims are exaggerated . Another proposed cause of increased tuition is U.S. Congress ' occasional raising of the ' loan limits ' of student loans , in which the increased availability of students to take out deeper loans sends a message to colleges and universities that students can afford more , and then , in response , institutions of higher education raise tuition to match , leaving the student back where he began , but deeper in debt . Therefore , if the students are able to afford a much higher amount than the free market would otherwise support for students without the ability to take out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to the new , higher , level that the student can now afford with loan subsidies . One rebuttal to that theory is the fact that even in years when loan limits have not risen , tuition has still continued to climb . However , that may not disprove this proposed cause : It may simply mean that other factors besides ' loan limit ' increases played a part in the increases in tuition . A third , novel , theory claims that the recent change in federal law removing all standard consumer protections ( truth in lending , bankruptcy proceedings , statutes of limits , the right to refinance , adherence to usury laws , and Fair Debt &amp; Collection practices , etc. ) strips students of the ability to declare bankruptcy , and , in response , the lenders and colleges know that students , defenseless to declare bankruptcy , are on the hook for any amount that they borrow -including late fees and interest ( which can be capitalized and increase the principal loan amount ) , thus removing the incentive to provide the student with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this theory , it has been shown that returning bankruptcy protections ( and other Standard Consumer Protections ) to Student Loans would cause lenders to be more cautious , thereby causing a sharp decline in the availability of student loans , which , in turn , would decrease the influx of dollars to colleges and universities , who , in turn , would have to sharply decrease tuition to match the lower availability of funds . Under this theory , if student loans did not have the ability to file for bankruptcy , it would be more profitable for the lender if the student defaulted ( due to the increases in the amount of the loan after fees and interest are capitalized ) , and thus there is no free market pressure-type motive for the lender or the college to help the student avoid default . This is especially true because the government , if it is the lender or guarantor of the loan , has the ability to garnish the borrower 's wages , tax return , and Social Security Disability income without a court order . Some have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will have such a high default rate , since the default rate for Student Loans is projected to reach 46.3% of all federal dollars disbursed to students at for-profit colleges in 2008 ( Budget lifetime default rate , loan default rate only 18.6% , meaning that 18.6% of all loans contain 46.3% of all dollars loaned out ) . Economic and social commentator Gary North has remarked at LewRockwell.com that To speak of college as a bubble is silly . A bubble does not pop until months or years after the funding ceases . There is no indication that the funding for college education will cease . Azar Nafisi , Johns Hopkins University professor and bestselling author of ' ' Reading Lolita in Tehran ' ' , has stated on the ' ' PBS NewsHour ' ' that a purely economic analysis of a higher education bubble is incomplete : # Recommendations # Based on the available data , recommendations to address rising tuition have been advanced by experts and consumer and students ' rights advocates : * Tax the endowment income of universities and link the endowment tax to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to reduce costs of instructor and administrator expenditures ( e.g. , cut salaries and/or reduce staff ) . * State and federal governments should increase appropriations , grants , and contracts to colleges and universities . * Federal , state , and local governments should reduce the regulatory burden on colleges and universities . * The federal government should enact partial or total loan forgiveness for students who have taken out student loans . Loan Forgiveness does not require the printing of new dollars ( i.e. , too much money chasing too few goods ) , and so it can not , in this way , directly result in inflation of the currency . * Federal lawmakers should return standard consumer protections ( truth in lending , bankruptcy proceedings , statutes of limitations , etc. ) to student loans which were removed by the passage of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-394 , enacted October 22 , 1994 ) , which amended the FFELP ( Federal Family Education Loan Program ) . * Cut lender subsidies , decrease student reliance on loans to pay for college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount a student may borrow . * Regulatory or legislative action to lower or freeze the tuition , such as Canada 's tuition freeze model , should be enacted by federal lawmakers : Potential downsides to tuition-freezing guarantees are evident , being offered by only few dozen colleges . Under the guarantees , the student 's tuition does not change for the extent of their education . Each year 's freshmen pay a higher rate , which is then guaranteed through their years in college . About 1 in 3 college students transfers to another school at some point . If tuition freezes become the default model for colleges , students would feel less able to change schools because they would be entering at a new , probably higher tuition . ** More research should be done : Recognised financial expert , Mark Kantrowitz , issued the following recommendations : : * The National Center for Education Statistics should increase the frequency of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study to annual , from triennial , in order to permit more timely tracking of the factors affecting tuition rate increases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should take steps to improve the efficiency of the data collection and publication for the Digest of Education Statistics , so that all tables will include more recent data . The most recent data listed in some tables is five years old . : * The US Department of Education should study the relationship between increases in average EFC ( Expected Family Contribution ) figures and average tuition rates . In addition , it would be worthwhile to examine how historical average EFC figures have changed relative to family income when measured on a current and constant dollar basis for each income quartile . * Other popular ways to address the rising tuition problems faced by students include completing your general education requirements at a community college , which is much cheaper than initially going to a university , obtaining scholarships and other financial aid , as well as looking for ways to pay in-state tuition . * Lastly , in order to cope with the rising cost of tuition , many students have started working part-time . When it comes to getting a job after college , to further cope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that the best move might be to get a job while in college . To facilitate these recommendations , some colleges help students in job searches and job placement after graduation. # See also # * College tuition in the United States * EdFund * Free education * Higher education * Higher Education Price Index * Post-secondary education * Private university * Student benefit * Student debt * Student loan * Student loans in the United States * Tuition agency * Tuition center * Tuition fees * Tuition freeze # References and notes # 
4 allegiance= type= Flight/Squadron The 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron ( 4477 TES ) was a squadron in the United States Air Force under the claimancy of the Tactical Air Command ( TAC ) . It is currently inactive . The product of Project Constant Peg , the unit was created to expose the tactical air forces to the flight characteristics of fighter aircraft used by Soviet Union during the Cold War . The declassified history of the squadron shows that it operated MiG-17s , MiG-21s and MiG-23s between 1977 and 1988 , but it was not formally disbanded until July 1990 . The mission of Constant Peg was to train Air Force , United States Navy and United States Marine Corps pilots and weapon systems officers , in air combat tactics against these foreign aircraft and was instrumental in the re-development of Dissimilar air combat training ( DACT ) methods developed after the end of the Vietnam War . Today 's USAF Aggressor training squadrons can symbolically trace their histories back to the 4477th , as well as the paint motifs on their aircraft , which were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s. # History # The longest continuing United States classified military airplane program is the testing and evaluation of Foreign Aircraft Technology . During the Cold War , secret test flying of Mikoyan-and-Gurevich Design Bureau ( MiG ) and other Soviet aircraft was an ongoing mission dating back to the acquisition of the first Soviet-built Yakovlev Yak-23 in 1953 . This effort has continued to the present day . Unlike the other black airplane programs , such as the Have Blue , Lockheed U-2 , or SR-71 Blackbird , Foreign Aircraft Technology operations still remain classified . Despite the declassification of the Constant Peg program in 2006 , the evaluation of foreign aircraft likely continues . It is not known exactly the actual number or types of aircraft involved , where they came from , or the complete history of the program . It is known that the activities of the 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron brought about a fundamental change in United States Air Force and United States Navy / United States Marine Corps air combat tactics . They revitalized the art of dogfighting at a time when , seemingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from testing the aircraft the squadron flew was reflected in the success of United States air operations during the Vietnam War , as well as the founding of the Air Force 's Red Flag program and the United States Navy 's TOPGUN school . # Origins # In the late 1950s , a new generation of United States fighters was being developed . As a result of the development of air-to-air missiles , fighter aircraft , such as the U.S. Navy 's F4H Phantom II , were developed . Later redesignated the F-4 in 1962 , the aircraft was the first fighter designed from the start with only air-to-air missiles , carrying both radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow III and the shorter-range AIM-9 Sidewinder infrared-guided missiles . With the new missiles came the new attitude that dog-fighting was obsolete . The air-to-air training given to new Navy and Marine Corps F-4 crews was extremely limited . It involved about ten flights and provided little useful information . By 1964 , few in the Navy and Marine Corps were left to carry on the tradition of classic dogfighting . Then came the Vietnam War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam showed the faith placed in missiles was terribly in error . Between 1965 and the bombing halt in 1968 , the USAF had a 2.15 to 1 kill ratio . The U.S. Navy was doing slightly better with a 2.75 to 1 rate . For roughly every two North Vietnamese MiG-17 Frescos or MiG-21 Fishbeds shot down , an American F-4 Phantom II , F-105 Thunderchief , or F-8 Crusader would be lost . This was far worse than the 10-plus to 1 kill rate during the Korean War . More serious , the percentage of United States fighters being lost in air-to-air combat was growing . During 1966 , only 3 percent of U.S. aircraft losses were due to MiGs . This rose to 8 percent in 1967 , then climbed to 22 percent for the first three months of 1968 . The emphasis on air-to-air missile interception meant the fighter combat crews had only the sketchiest knowledge of dogfighting . Originally conceived as a naval fleet air defense aircraft , and later adapted as an Air Force fighter-bomber , the design of the F-4 made it ill-suited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the F-4 was large and heavy . When a tight turn was made , the F-4 would lose energy and airspeed . The MiG-17 's superior turning capability then allowed it to close to gun range . All too often , hits from the MiG-17 's outmoded cannons would then destroy the F-4 . Under the HAVE DOUGHNUT and HAVE DRILL programs , the first MiGs flown in the United States , were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance and technical capabilities , as well as in operational capability , pitting the types against U.S. fighters . The data from the Have Doughnut and Have Drill tests were provided to the newly formed United States Navy Fighter Weapons School ( TOPGUN ) at NAS Miramar , California . During the remainder of the Vietnam War , the Navy kill ratio climbed to 8.33 to 1 . In contrast , the Air Force rate improved only slightly to 2.83 to 1 . The reason for this difference was TOPGUN . The Navy ( to include the Marine Corps ) had revitalized its air combat training , while the Air Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were by TOPGUN graduates . By 1970 , the Have Drill program was expanded ; a few selected fleet F-4 crews were given the chance to fight the MiGs . The most important result of Project Have Drill is that no Navy pilot who flew in the project defeated the MiG-17 Fresco in the first engagement . The Have Drill dogfights were by invitation only . The other pilots based at Nellis Air Force Base were not to know about the U.S.-operated MiGs . To prevent any sightings , the airspace above the Groom Lake portion of the Nellis Range was closed . On aeronautical maps , the exercise area was marked in red ink . The forbidden zone became known as Red Square . The idea of a more realistic training program for the Air Force was devised by USAF Colonel Gail Peck , a Vietnam veteran F-4 pilot , who was dissatisfied with his service 's fighter pilot training . After the war , he worked at the Department of Defense , where he heard about the HAVE DRILL and HAVE DOUGHNUT programs . He won the support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constant Peg , named after Vandenberg 's callsign , Constant , and Peck 's wife , Peg . # MiGs # Tactical Air Command established the 4477th Test and Evaluation Flight as the formal USAF testing unit on 1 April 1977 . It began with three MiGs : two MiG-17Fs and a MiG-21 loaned by Israel , who had captured them from the Syrian Air Force and Iraqi Air Force . Later , it added MiG-21s from the Indonesian Air Force . By the late 1970s , United States MiG operations were undergoing another change . In the late 1960s , the MiG-17 and MiG-21F were still frontline aircraft . A decade later , they had been superseded by later-model MiG-21s and new aircraft , such as the MiG-23 . Fortunately , a new source of supply of Soviet aircraft became available , Egypt . In the mid-1970s , relations between Egypt and the Soviet Union had become strained , and Soviet advisers were ordered out . The Soviets had provided the Egyptian air force with MiGs since the mid-1950s . Now , with their traditional source out of the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States companies for parts to support their late-model MiG-21s and MiG-23s . Very soon , a deal was made . According to one account , two MiG-23 fighter bombers were given to the United States by Egyptian president Anwar Sadat . The planes were disassembled and shipped from Egypt to Edwards Air Force Base . They were then transferred initially to Groom Lake for reassembly and study . In 1987 , the U.S. Air Force bought 12 new Shenyang F-7Bs from China for use in the Constant Peg program . At the same time , it retired the remaining MiG-21F-13 Fishbeds acquired from Indonesia . The United States operated MiGs received special designations . There was the practical problem of what to call the aircraft . This was solved by giving them numbers in the Century Series . The MiG-21s and Shenyang F-7Bs were called the YF-110 ( the original designation for the USAF F-4C ) , while the MiG-23s were called the YF-113 . The focus of Air Force Systems Command ( AFSC ) limited the use of the MiGs as tools with which to understand the performance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tactical Air Command was interested in training the front line tactical fighter pilots . Air Force Systems Command recruited its MiG pilots from the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base , California , who were usually graduates from either the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards or the Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River , Maryland . Tactical Air Command selected its MiG pilots primarily from the ranks of the Weapons School and Aggressors at Nellis AFB . Similarly , the US Navy and US Marine Corps pilots were recruited from the graduates of the Naval Fighter Weapons School , better known as Top Gun . The aircraft were collected at the Department of Energy 's Tonopah Test Range , where they were flown by the squadron . The squadron operated MiG-17s until 1982 , but mostly MiG-21s and MiG-23s. # Aggressor training # The lackluster performance of USAF fighter pilots against North Vietnamese Air Force MiG pilots over the skies of Vietnam was studied by the United States Air Force Fighter Weapons School at Nellis AFB , Nevada during the early 1970s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maneuvers was a major cause of the low air-to-air kill rate , as well some technical limitations in the F-4 Phantom II , the primary fighter in use by the Air Force over the skies of Vietnam . The 414th Fighter Weapons Squadron , part of the Fighter Weapons School had flown its F-4s against the HAVE FERRY MiG-17F , which was fundamentally different than flying against the F-105 Thunderchief and other United States fighters . It was believed that by developing a squadron dedicated to Dissimilar air combat training ( DACT ) against pilots trained in Soviet fighter tactics and to equip it with an aircraft with flight characteristics similar to the MiGs they would face in combat . Combat training would change from one pilot in an F-4 flying against another F-4 to flying against another pilot who , in a fundamentally different aircraft , would think and fly like a Soviet pilot . The 64th Fighter Weapons Squadron , equipped with Northrop T-38 Talons was activated in October 1972 as the USAF 's first Aggressor squadron . Its pilots were trained against the Soviet MiGs at Groom Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Command pilots , employing known Soviet fighter tactics against them in air-to-air combat training . They were also trained to fly against acquired Soviet air defense systems similar to those that US pilots had faced in North Vietnam . The pilots of the 64th were also well-seasoned combat veterans of the Vietnam War , many with Distinguished Flying Crosses and over 100 combat missions over North Vietnam . Beginning in the spring of 1973 , the squadron began deploying to TAC bases in the United States to perform DACT training against F-4 pilots . The training program was successful , and beginning in November 1975 , a large-scale exercise Red Flag 1 was held at Nellis AFB where training was held on a large scale . The acquired Soviet air defense radar was installed at several locations on the Nellis range , and simulated Soviet integrated missile and antiaircraft artillery batteries , similar to that what was faced in Vietnam and by Israeli pilots during the 1973 Yom Kippur War were set up . Selected TAC pilots were taken to Groom Lake to train against the HAVE FERRY MiG-17 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squadron was established as the second Aggressor squadron . With the fall of Saigon , the United States had some 70 F-5E Tiger II fighter aircraft in storage , which were paid for by Congress to send to the South Vietnamese Air Force . The T-38s used by the Aggressor squadrons were trainers and similar to the F-5 , but were not combat aircraft and were not ideal in the role of simulating the performance of the Soviet MiG , however the higher-performance F-5E was . When South Vietnam collapsed , the T-38s were replaced by the F-5Es as the Aggressor aircraft . The circumstances also made the creation of two more Aggressor Squadrons in 1975/1976 , the 26th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron at Clark Air Base , Philippines , to train PACAF pilots and the 527th Tactical Fighter Training Aggressor Squadron at RAF Alconbury , England to train USAFE pilots . # Establishment of the 4477th # During the 1970s , the number of acquired Soviet aircraft increased to include MiG-21s and MiG-23s .

The Tonopah Test Range Airport was only 70 miles to the northwest of Groom Lake and was on the controlled AEC Tonopah Test Range fitted the need for a new home . The AEC airport had the potential for improvement and expansion , with the only public land overlooking the base miles away . Although not as hidden as Groom Lake , the airport would be remote enough to operate the Soviet aircraft . In fact , the security surrounding the Tonopah Test Range was so effective that the new base was not publicly reported as an Air Force military airfield until 1985 . On 1 April 1977 Tactual Air Command established the 4477th Test and Evaluation Flight , which assumed the personnel and equipment of the un-designated testing unit at Groom Lake and moved the program to Tonopah TRA . The unit was officially assigned to Nellis AFB under the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing . Two pilots of the 4477th died flying the Soviet planes .

Three-star generals do not generally fly test missions , so Bond 's death attracted press interest . The fact that the Air Force also refused to identify the type of plane also raised questions . Early reports claimed he had been flying a super-secret Stealth fighter prototype . The death of a three-star general led the Air Force to reveal that it was flying Soviet aircraft . A boulevard cut-off between Eglin Air Force Base ( main base ) and Hurlburt Field in Florida is named in his honor . # End of operations # Near the end of the Cold War the program was ostensibly abandoned and the squadron was disbanded . Flight operations at Tonopah closed down in March 1988 , although the 4477th was not inactivated until July 1990 , according to one official Air Force history . In the interim , a handful of pilots flew ' continuation training ( CT ) ' sorties at Groom Lake . The decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that a new generation of Soviet Aircraft was entering service and also the inevitable round of budget cuts from Washington . The assets of the squadron could not go to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan AFB , and the fate of them remains in some cases , still classified . Several of the F-110s ( MiG-21 ) were sent to museums or now are on static display . Some of the airplanes may have been broken up , and its rumored that some were buried in the Nevada desert . Also a few were used for target practice on Air Force weapons ranges . # Ongoing Foreign Technology Evaluation # After the 4477 TES was inactivated , the remaining assets were reconstituted as a detachment of the 57th Fighter Wing at Nellis AFB , now known as Detachment 3 , 53rd Test and Evaluation Group . Anecdotal evidence suggests that exploitation of foreign aircraft today has returned to the original hierarchy seen in the 1960s and 1970s when HAVE IDEA became the umbrella program for exploiting foreign tactical fighters : the ' assets ' are exploited first for performance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successor to AFSC ) , before Air Force Combat Command ( the successor to TAC ) is then given access to the aircraft for tactical exploitation . There have been multiple sightings of foreign aircraft over Nevada since the end of Constant Peg and the inactivation of the 4477th TES : In a March 1994 article on Groom Lake in Popular Science , a photo was published of an Su-22 Fitter in flight . The plane was painted in a green and tan finish . The Su-22 is a swing-wing , light-attack aircraft . It was in frontline Russian Air Force service at the time and was exported widely to Eastern European and Third-World countries during the 1970s and 1980s . Also in 1993 , the United States and Germany trained with former East German MiG-23s and two Su-22s which were sent to the United States . With East and West Germany now unified , there was an ample supply of both Soviet-built planes and the spare parts needed to support them . In October 1994 , Aerospace Daily reported that reliable observers had sighted an Su-27 Flanker on two occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is in operation with both the Russian and Communist Chinese air forces . In 2014 , it is believed that Air Force Combat Command ( ACC ) shares access to MiG-29 Fulcrums and Sukhoi Su-27 aircraft somewhere in Nevada ( most likely Groom Lake ) flying against Fighter Weapons School instructors , 422d Test and Evaluation Squadron aircrews and F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon Aggressor aircraft flying from Nellis AFB. # Lineage # * Established by Tactical Air Command as 4477th Test and Evaluation Flight and activated , 1 April 1977 : Status changed to Squadron and re-designated : 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron , 1 May 1980 : Inactivated on 15 July 1990 # Assignments # * 57th Tactical Training Wing , 1 April 1977 : Re-designated : 57th Fighter Weapons Wing , 1 March 1980-15 July 1990 # Stations # * Nellis Air Force Base , Nevada , 1 April 1977 15 July 1990 : Operationally located at : Tonopah Test Range Airport , Nevada entire period # Aircraft # As an OPSEC measure , the Soviet aircraft had their own US aircraft designations in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NATO : Fishbed-C/E * YF-110C Chinese Chengdu J-7B ( MiG-21F-13 variant ) * YF-110D Soviet MiG-21MF NATO : Fishbed-J * YF-113B Soviet MiG-23BN NATO : Flogger-F * YF-113E Soviet MiG-23MS NATO : Flogger-E * YF-114C Soviet MiG-17F NATO : Fresco-C * YF-114D Soviet MiG-17PF NATO : Fresco-D * Northrop T-38/F-5E/F Tiger II Used as a chase/DACT training planes

4 ' ' Za Ukrainu ' ' ( , or For Ukraine ) is a Ukrainian patriotic song . In 1991 was a candidate to be adopted as the anthem of Ukraine . # Background # The song was written by a prominent Ukrainian poet , civil activist , politician , and one of the founders of the Central Rada Mykola Voronyi . Ironically , Voronyi being from a former serf-peasant family was eventually murdered by the Soviet regime as a ' ' socially dangerous element ' ' . Later posthumously he was rehabilitated by the Kirovohrad Oblast Court . The music to the Vorony 's lyric was written by Yaroslav Yaroslavenko , a Ukrainian composer and conductor from Lviv . The song later in the beginning of 1990 's was popularized by the Ukrainian folk-band ' ' Sokoly ' ' led by Ivan Matsyalko from Lviv Oblast . The song also is considered as the alternative Ukrainian anthem , unofficially . It was popular among the Ukrainian Army in the struggle against the Soviets . **23;21775;br # pre-2003 lyrics # valign= top width= 100% !

MLE shows multiple layers of this lamellar structure , and as a moisturizer , MLE offers long-lasting skin moisturizing effects through reinforcing the skin 's natural barrier function . Under cross polarized microscopy , skin lipids and MLE show the similar cross-like structure , termed as Maltese cross structure , and under electron microscopy , lamellar structures are observed .

The efficacy of MLE on skin barrier was proven by several clinical studies performed in independent University Hospitals and reported in peer-reviewed academic journals , including Journal of Investigative Dermatology , one of the most renowned journals in the field of dermatology . Along with its therapeutic benefits , MLE also shows non-sticky textures , allowing quick absorption after application . As an O/W emulsion , MLE can be also used as a vehicle ( carrier ) for topical drugs . The multiple layer of MLE offers stabilization of active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) and efficient penetration of API into skin .

4 ' ' Accidental Life ' ' ( ' ' Sluajni ivot ' ' ) is a 1969 Croatian drama film directed by Ante Peterli , starring Dragutin Klobuar , Ivo Serdar , Ana Kari and Zvonimir Rogoz . ' ' Accidental Life ' ' , an existential study of ordinary lives led by two alienated urban white collar workers , was the debut feature film of Ante Peterli , Croatian film theorist and film critic . The film received mediocre reviews and went largely unnoticed after its release , but has been reevaluated decades later as one of the best Croatian films ever made . # Plot # Filip ( Dragutin Klobuar ) and Stanko ( Ivo Serdar ) are two young clerks who share an office in a nondescript company . The two are also amateur rowers who train together . Their personalities are quite different : while Filip is fastidious , serious in relationships with women , and somewhat introverted and sensitive , Stanko is a womanizer and prone to shirking his duties at work . Still , they spend most of they time together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office during the day , and going out in the evening looking for female company - all trying desperately to escape from the tedium of everyday life . They see their senior colleague Jurak ( Zvonimir Rogoz ) as a dinosaur , dreading the possibility of becoming like him as they grow older . Filip falls in love with an attractive female coworker and , as the events gradually unfold , differences in character between the two men create a simmering conflict .. # Background and production # By the time Ante Peterli set out to direct ' ' Accidental Life ' ' , his debut feature film , he was already well known as a prominent young film critic , and a professor of film theory at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb . In the 1960s he directed his first short TV drama , and was active as an assistant director in several feature films and documentaries , working also as a script doctor . The role of Stanko was initially intended for Zvonimir rnko , but he was busy shooting a TV series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt that Klobuar was better suited for the character of Filip , the more introverted protagonist , so Stanko 's role ultimately went to Ivo Serdar . Due to budget constraints , the film was shot quickly , with a small crew . Peterli likened the near-amateur filming conditions to those prevalent in the French New Wave , his main influence at the time . Still , he saw ' ' Accidental Life ' ' as a work that , rather than being a New Wave film ' ' per se ' ' , projects a New-Wave-like atmosphere by striving to tell the truth about its times and about my generation by using a more modern way of storytelling . # Themes # Croatian film critic Jurica Pavii describes ' ' Accidental Life ' ' as typical in many respects for the Croatian cinema of the late 1960s , which was increasingly moving away from historical , rural settings and adopting urban themes and sensibilities . The two protagonists are members of the lost generation who are urban loners with no ambition or direction in life . They are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with no past , which makes them an oddity in a still traditional society which highly values family background and kinship . The film 's portrayal of a faceless , dehumanized workplace is highly reminiscent of ' ' Il Posto ' ' , a 1961 film by Ermanno Olmi . ' ' Accidental Life ' ' thus largely reflected the modernist sensibilities of its era , but opted for a classicist visual approach . As a fan of Howard Hawks and John Ford , Peterli preferred the subtle , invisible style of directing - using simple , functional shots - over the more extravagant modernist film techniques . # Reception # ' ' Accidental Life ' ' was shown at the Pula Film Festival , receiving mediocre reviews from the critics .

4 The 2011 Singapore Grand Prix , formally the 2011 Formula 1 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix , was a Formula One motor race that was held on 25 September 2011 at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Singapore . It was the fourteenth round of the 2011 Formula One season , and the twelfth time the Singapore Grand Prix had been held . The race , contested over 61 laps , was won by Red Bull 's Sebastian Vettel , the drivers ' championship leader , after starting from pole position . Jenson Button finished in second place for McLaren , and Mark Webber completed the podium in third position . As a consequence of the race , Vettel extended his lead in the World Drivers ' Championship to 124 points over Button , who moved up to second place in the championship . Fernando Alonso and Webber , third and fourth in the championship , were eliminated from championship contention . In the World Constructors ' Championship , Red Bull extended their championship lead over McLaren to 138 points , with Ferrari a further 85 points behind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the championship title . # Report # # Background # The build-up to the race was marked by accusations that Red Bull Racing had violated the Resource Restriction Agreement in , accusations that the team denied . The RRA is an agreement between members of the Formula One Teams Association designed to cut costs within the sport . The agreement outlines the teams ' projected budgets including both financial and non-financial elements , such as the amount of time spent using a wind tunnel for upcoming seasons and limits them to using only as much as they had agreed upon . Following an audit from a Dutch consultancy firm , it was reported that Red Bull had violated the RRA when other teams including McLaren , Ferrari , Mercedes and Sauber had passed the inspection . Vitantonio Liuzzi was handed a five-place grid penalty for the race for causing an accident on the first lap of the . His HRT team added a tribute to Christian Bakkerud onto their cars after Bakkerud , who raced in the 24 Hours of Le Mans twice for HRT principal Colin Kolles ' team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scuderia Toro Rosso inadvertently broke one of its curfews when team principal Franz Tost arrived at the circuit too early . Because the Singapore Grand Prix is a night race , it starts at 10pm local time instead of 2pm as the European races do , meaning that the timetable of events is different for the duration of the Grand Prix weekend . The curfew period is officially defined as the nine hours before the first practice session , and therefore takes up daylight hours at Singapore instead of the early-morning hours in Europe . As Tost entered the circuit before the curfew had expired , the team were considered to have used up one of the four waivers to the curfew that all teams were allocated for 2011 . Red Bull , Mercedes and Virgin all fell afoul of the different timetable on the Saturday morning . All three teams later had their curfew exemptions restored after they demonstrated that the early staff members who originally broke the curfew were not involved with working on their cars . Tyre supplier Pirelli brought its yellow-banded soft compound tyre as the harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option compound , as opposed to the previous year where Bridgestone brought the medium compound as the prime . A single DRS ( Drag Reduction System ) Zone was used in the race . The detection point was located at turn 4 with the DRS activation point 35m after the turn 5 apex . This resulted in plenty of passing into the turn 7 braking zone . The race marked the 50th Grand Prix of Sbastien Buemi , who made his debut at the 2009 Australian Grand Prix , and was Sebastian Vettel 's 50th race for Red Bull . # Free Practice # The first practice session was delayed by half an hour to allow for circuit repairs to take place . Competitors in the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia support races dislodged plastic kerbing on Republic Boulevard and Esplanade Drive , forcing the Grand Prix practice session to be delayed while the offending parts were removed and the circuit deemed safe . When the circuit was re-opened , the practice session was shortened to one hour instead of the prescribed ninety minutes . Lewis Hamilton finished the session fastest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was a second faster than his team-mate Mark Webber . Webber had previously had an on-track encounter with Timo Glock that destroyed his front wing and gave Glock a puncture , which ended his session . The session was interrupted several minutes later when Heikki Kovalainen 's Lotus T128 caught fire in almost exactly the same place that his car caught alight in 2010 . The session was stopped while Kovalainen 's car was retrieved , and restarted , only to be stopped again ten minutes from the end of the hour . Felipe Massa had hit a kerb , dislodging it and exposing the bolt that was supposed to secure it in place . The session restarted with three minutes remaining , before the circuit was repaired ahead of the second practice session . Fernando Alonso was fourth , followed by Jenson Button and Massa . Narain Karthikeyan drove the HRT for the first time since Valencia in this session , in preparation for his drive at his home race in India . He finished the session 24th and last , one tenth slower than teammate Daniel Ricciardo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second practice session with kerbing at Turn 13 removed . When the lights went green , the Lotus mechanics were still trying to rebuild Kovalainen 's car . Jenson Button 's session ended prematurely when he locked his brakes and stopped just before the wall at Turn 14 , and was unable to restart the car ; however , the time he had recorded until then was fast enough to be tenth overall at the end of the session . Sbastien Buemi 's session was also ended early , when he collided with the barriers at Turn 21 , going too fast through the corner and damaging his suspension . Team-mate Jaime Alguersuari also had little running before a mechanical problem ended his session , while Paul di Resta 's session was also shortened after a hydraulic brakes issue limited him to eight laps in the session . Vitaly Petrov had been scheduled to run upgraded bodywork parts on his Renault R31 , but the team discovered the car overheated , and were forced to abandon the new parts until Suzuka . Vettel set the quickest time in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Massa , Webber and Michael Schumacher completing the top six . Circuit repairs took place overnight in an effort to improve the kerbing and prevent the race weekend from being further disrupted . The kerbs at Turn 3 and Turn 7 were removed entirely , and replaced with painted markings , with the drivers to be briefed on what would be considered an acceptable racing line through the affected corners . The kerb at the entry to Turn 14 was likewise removed , but with no further plans to replace it , while efforts were made to secure the kerbs at Turn 13 and the Singapore Sling chicane . The FIA was unwilling to commit to one definitive plan , instead opting to reassess the situation once the initial work had been completed and again after the third practice session . The drivers expressed indifference towards the changes , with Felipe Massa commenting that it 's not a big change having or not having it , though he did point out that several drivers felt the kerbs at Turn 13 were unnecessary and that the FIA should consider the kerbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Qualifying # Qualifying was marked by a distinct spread across the grid , with several teams reproducing similar times between their drivers , comfortably separated from other teams . Sebastian Vettel was fastest in the first period , half a second clear of Jenson Button . As the session drew on , it became clear that several teams were in danger of being eliminated . Vitaly Petrov spent most of the session in 18th , and improved on his final run , but team mate Bruno Senna was faster and relegated Petrov on his final lap . Petrov blamed a small error for compromising his run , briefly losing control of the back end of the car just enough to change his tyre pressures and costing him the tenth of a second he would have needed to advance to Q2 . Senna claimed he had been impeded by Jaime Alguersuari on his flying lap , but the incident was not investigated . Heikki Kovalainen qualified ahead of Jarno Trulli , followed by the Virgins of Timo Glock and Jrme d'Ambrosio and the Hispanias of Daniel Ricciardo out-qualifying Vitantonio Liuzzi for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for causing a collision on the first lap of the Italian Grand Prix two weeks previously , but made no effect to his grid position of 24th . The second session was red-flagged when Kamui Kobayashi crashed at the Turn 10 chicane . Missing the first apex , his Sauber C30 was launched into the air by the kerb on the second apex , throwing him into the barriers . Qualifying was halted while the car was retrieved and debris from the crash cleared away . Kobayashi 's crash meant that he would fail to set a lap time and would start from seventeenth on the grid . When the session was restarted , Vettel once ageain led the way . Lewis Hamilton attempted a second flying lap during the session , but was forced to pit almost straight away when he picked up a puncture in his right-rear tyre . Under the sporting regulations , Hamilton would not be allowed to replace the damaged set of tyres with a fresh one , thereby depriving him of a set of option tyres for the race . Kobayashi 's team-mate Sergio Prez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Q3 , but was knocked out at the last moment by Paul di Resta ; the Mexican driver qualified eleventh ahead of the Williams pair of Rubens Barrichello and Pastor Maldonado . Sbastien Buemi and Jaime Alguersuari were fourteenth and sixteenth for Scuderia Toro Rosso , split by the lone Renault of Bruno Senna . Although , this made it the first time since the 2010 Canadian Grand Prix that both Force Indias had made it into Q3 . The third session began with four drivers queueing at the end of pit lane , an unusual sight in Formula One , as they would all be running in the dirty air generated by the cars in front . However , with a full lap of the Marina Bay circuit taking almost two minutes to complete , the drivers would have to race get back to the pits on their in-lap if they intended to make a second run . Jenson Button led Fernando Alonso , Felipe Massa and Hamilton out of the pits . Hamilton later faced criticism for an aggressive move on Felipe Massa at Turn 19 on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , compromising his flying lap as speed carried into the final corner would translate into a faster lap time . Massa questioned why Hamilton felt the need for such an aggressive move as opposed to slowing on his out-lap to allow for clear running . Force India also received criticism when both their drivers again elected to stay in the pits rather than set a flying lap ; Mercedes ' Michael Schumacher followed a similar approach , but did leave the pits in order to line up ahead of them . Sebastian Vettel , who had waited in pit for the queue of cars to clear , once again rose to provisional pole . Jenson Button was second until Hamilton and Mark Webber claimed second in succession . Button took third from Hamilton with his second flying lap , but Hamilton was held in the pits with a fuel problem long enough that he would not have enough time to navigate the circuit and get back to the start line before the chequered flag fell , and he had to settle for fourth . Alonso and Massa were fifth and sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap time in seventh . Vettel attempted to set a second lap time , but made a mistake and aborted the lap ; however , his original time was still fast enough for pole position , his eleventh of the season . The end result meant that the Red Bull cars occupied the first row of the grid , the McLarens the second , with both Ferraris on the third row , Mercedes completing the fourth and the Force Indias the fifth row . # Race # At the start , Vettel kept his lead into the first corner , while teammate Webber fell to fourth . Hamilton tried to take Webber after a good start for third place , but had to back out and fell to seventh . Button and Alonso 's good starts put them into second and third in the race . There was contact between Massa and Rosberg at Turn 1 forcing Rosberg to run straight across Turn 2 and filter in just behind Webber ; he conceded the place back to Massa later in the lap . Ricciardo also made contact , forcing him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schumacher on lap 4 , repassing him on the run to Turn 7 , before passing Rosberg for sixth on the next lap . On Lap 10 , Glock crashed at the final turn , and retired with rear suspension damage ; whilst on the same lap Webber dived down Alonso 's outside into Turn 14 , Alonso then ran a bit wide allowing Webber to come down the outside again and take the position from him with a bold move at Turn 16 . Alonso pitted on the next lap , switching from the option to the prime tyres . Meanwhile , Hamilton and Massa both pitted on lap 12 , Ferrari winning the pit stop battle and with Massa staying in fifth place , and Alonso emerging at Turn 1 just in front of the pair , despite being held up by Barrichello . Alonso would also move back ahead of Webber , when Webber made his pit stop . Hamilton attacked immediately on the out lap and made contact with Massa at turn 7 . When Hamilton tried to go around the outside of the corner , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , causing both drivers Massa with a right rear puncture , dropping him down to nineteenth , and Hamilton for a new front wing to pit again . Hamilton was later given a drive through penalty for causing an avoidable collision . Behind Vettel and Button , di Resta had moved into third , after running a different strategy to the majority of his rivals . He kept this place until lap 19 , when he conceded it to Alonso at Turn 7 . He pitted not long after this , and fell to eighth behind teammate Sutil . Webber closed up behind Alonso and was half a second behind by lap 25 , before Alonso pitted for the second time . Rosberg ran wide at the final corner on lap 29 , which allowed Prez and Schumacher to close up on Rosberg . Prez took the defensive line for Turn 7 , and Schumacher attempted to go around the outside . Prez held the racing line , and Schumacher ran into the back of him , scattering debris across the track . Schumacher later described the incident as a racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brake as early as he did . Schumacher retired while Prez continued on relatively unscathed . The safety car was deployed while the debris was cleared , with many drivers electing to make pit stops , and as a result Vettel 's lead of more than 20 seconds was wiped out . At the restart , Vettel immediately pulled out a 4 second lead over second placed Button , who was stuck behind a train of backmarkers led by Jarno Trulli . Trulli was lapped by Kobayashi at Turn 1 while Button attempted to get past them . Webber passed Alonso down the inside into the Singapore Sling chicane , later describing the manoeuvre as spectacular . Martin Brundle also described the overtake , as opportunistic . Even despite this overtake , Webber was already five seconds behind Button . Meanwhile , Hamilton began his recovery following his drive through penalty , and was up to sixth place on lap 38 , before passing di Resta the following lap . Kobayashi was later given a drive-through penalty for ignoring blue flags , when Button had been stuck behind for over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gearbox failure on lap 46 . Webber pitted and changed to the option tyre on lap 48 , and was temporarily overtaken by Hamilton . Button pitted the next lap and changed to another set of option tyres . This allowed Vettel to cover Button , and he pitted the next lap . As he exited the pits , the Lotus of Heikki Kovalainen was released into his path but he drove past Kovalainen in the pit lane exit . Alonso also made his stop on the same lap as Vettel , leaving him behind Webber this time . With seven laps to go , Hamilton passed di Resta once again for fifth place , as team-mate Button set the race 's fastest lap . Massa also managed to get back into the points after his clash with Hamilton , as he passed Barrichello and Prez to move into ninth . McLaren were still trying to pressure Vettel , and Button closed the gap to under fround seconds by the time Vettel had cleared lapped traffic . Unfortunately for him , Button also had to clear this traffic , and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . Alguersuari crashed at turn 18 on the penultimate lap , ending his day , but classified in 21st . Vettel was caught behind the Massa-Prez scrap for ninth on the final lap as Button backed out of his fight for victory . Massa missed the chance to take eighth from Sutil by having to let Vettel through . Thus , Vettel took his third successive victory , leading from lights-to-flag for the first time since the 2010 European Grand Prix . He was followed over the line by Button , who was only 1.7 seconds behind by the end of the race , and took his fourth podium in a row . Webber completed the podium followed by Alonso and Hamilton . Di Resta scored his best finish in Formula One with sixth place , ahead of Rosberg , Sutil , Massa and Prez , who rounded out the points . # Post-race # The result of the race meant that Vettel had not already won his second World Championship ; but , with Hamilton failing to beat Vettel , Alonso failing to stand on the podium , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers were eliminated from Championship contention . Button became the only man who could stop Vettel now , finishing second in the race and moving up to second place in the Drivers ' Championship . He was 124 points behind Vettel , with only 125 points still available , which meant that even if Button won all of the remaining races , Vettel needed just one tenth place to retain his world title . This result also meant it was possible for Red Bull to clinch their second successive Constructors ' world title in Japan , by scoring 34 points more than McLaren . Massa expressed frustration with Hamilton , publically criticising him after the race . He was already annoyed at Hamilton , following an incident in qualifying where Hamilton lunged down Massa 's inside , attempting to pass on an out-lap . Massa also went up to Hamilton in the post-race TV interview area as he was about to start an interview with RTL Television , patted his shoulder , and sarcastically said : Good job , bro. # Classification # # Qualifying # Notes : : Adrian Sutil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit in Q3 , while Michael Schumacher only drove an out-lap , so they did not set a lap time . : Kamui Kobayashi crashed on his out-lap in Q2 , and so failed to set a lap time . : Vitantonio Liuzzi was given a five-place grid penalty for causing the first-corner accident at the , although ultimately it had no effect as he qualified last anyway . # Race # Notes : : Jaime Alguersuari crashed on lap 60 of the race , but was classified as he had completed over 90% of the winner 's race distance . # Championship standings after the race # ; Drivers ' Championship standings ; Constructors ' Championship standings class= wikitable style= font-size : 95% ; ! ! !

In 1998 , she criticised the decision of the church to honour Rupert Murdoch with a knighthood : It sends out the message that you can make a living out of something soft pornography that is regarded by the Church as sinful , and yet you can be awarded for it . The Knighthood of St. Gregory is supposed to be about honour and chivalry and splendour . To give it to Murdoch is ridiculous and wrong .

Despite an opening-day 3-1 home defeat to Middlesbrough , this was followed by back-to-back away victories at Southampton and Manchester City , the first time they won an away league game in 16 months . However , after 34 years and 10 close shaves with relegation , their luck finally ran out and they were relegated from the top flight ( the first time the club had suffered relegation for 43 years since they were relegated to the Old Division Four in 1958 ) . Much optimism followed Coventry 's relegation with everyone at the club working hard to attain promotion at the first attempt . These hopes were boosted with the signing of prolific striker Lee Hughes from local rivals West Bromwich Albion . # Final league table # cellspacing= 1 cellpadding= 1 style= border:1px solid #fff ; background : #fff ; width:500px ; !

514 The Battle of the Dalmatian Channels was a three-day confrontation between three tactical groups of Yugoslav Navy ships and coastal artillery , and a detachment of naval commandos of the Croatian Navy fought on 1416 November 1991 during the Croatian War of Independence . On 14 November , the commandos torpedoed a ' ' Mirna ' ' -class patrol boat P-176 ' ' Mukos ' ' close to the island of Bra in the Split Channel of the Adriatic Sea , prompting a Yugoslav naval bombardment of Bra and olta Island the same day . The drifting ' ' Mukos ' ' was salvaged by Croatian civilian boats and was beached at Neujam bay . The next day , a group of Yugoslav Navy vessels deployed to the Split Channel , organised into the Katela tactical group ( TG ) and bombarded the city of Split in retaliation for the loss of ' ' Mukos ' ' . In return , Croatian coastal artillery engaged the Katela TG .

The warships were then engaged by Croatian coastal artillery deployed on Korula and the Peljeac Peninsula , losing two minesweepers to the artillery fire in the process . The battle marked the last deployment of the Yugoslav Navy into one of the Dalmatian channels , the loosening of the naval blockade of the Croatian coast imposed in September and the largest Croatian Navy operation in the war . The Croatian Navy later towed the grounded ' ' Mukos ' ' to ibenik , repaired the vessel and put her into service as OB-62 ' ' olta ' ' .

In response to the difficult position of the Yugoslav Navy vessels north of olta and Bra , the Vis TG led by ' ' Pula ' ' sailed north from the island of Vis to draw some of the artillery fire away from the Katela TG . As the ships approached the Split Entrance , they made a radar contact sailing away from Split towards open sea at a high speed .

According to the UNT Composition Department , the award for Dr. Thomson was particularly deserved because he is continuing a broad ( interdisciplinary ) and prolific career in music that spans beyond that of a composer . # Military service # Thomas served as a Seaman ( S2c ; Service No. 358 74 10 ) in the U.S. Navy from 1945 to 1946 . He was a musician in a Navy Band at Camp Elliott , California . Then he joined the Navy Band ( as jazz trumpet soloist ) aboard the USS Lexington ( CV-16 ) as it sailed from San Diego to Pearl Harbor . While at Camp Elliott , Thomson did freelance arranging for Gus Arnheim , who , in the 1940s , owned a nightclub in downtown San Diego where he kept a small band going . Thomson was not permitted to enter the club during performances ( he was too young ) ; but he listened to the band playing his arrangements over the radio . Arnheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # In his younger days , Thomson learned to play french horn and trumpet , both in the classical and jazz idioms . When Thomson was five , his father bought him a cornet , hoping to stave off his interest in the piano that his sister was studying ( boys did n't play piano ) . And from that age , Thomson 's mother began driving him to TCU on Saturdays for lessons with Don Gillis . When Thomson was eight , Don recommended that -- since the highest paid member of any symphony in this country ( after the concert master ) , was the principal French horn player -- perhaps he should switch to horn . So he did . The Gillis family lived in Polytechnic Heights , about four blocks from the Thomson family . The Gillis family attended Poly Baptist church , where the Thomson family were members . Don Gillis was very much involved in music at TCU . Growing up , Thomson played French horn in Poly Baptist Church orchestra , directed by Don Gillis . Don 's sister , Eileen , played piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn . A member of the Crystal Springs Ramblers , Kenneth Pitts , played violin . Thomson read the baritone part from the Broadman Hymnal , transposing it for horn . Thomson attended Polytechnic High School , where he was involved in the band . Thomson became proficient at playing jazz solos on French horn with the Poly High School band . His high school band director was Perry Alton Sandifer ( 19102009 ) , a trombonist , saxophonist , and clarinetist who , outside of school , performed in dance orchestras -- one led by him bearing his name . Thomson graduated from Polytechnic High School in 1943. # Family # William Ennis Thomson ( aka Billy , while growing up ) was born 1927 in Fort Worth to the marriage of William Tell Thomson ( a builder ) and Ruby F. Thomson ( ' ' ' ' Schwarz ; a homemaker ) . He had two siblings : Jack C. Thomson ( b. 1912 ) and Aline Thomson ( born 1918 ) .

514 Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan is an Indian ' ' sitar ' ' player . Khan received the national awards Padma Shri ( 1970 ) and Padma Bhushan ( 2006 ) and was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for 1987. # Life # Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan regarded as one of the ' Sitar Trinity ' of India along with Ravi Shankar and Vilayat Khan and is the youngest of them . He was born in 1929 , in Jawra , Madhya Pradesh , as the son of Jaffer Khan , a versatile vocalist , sitarist and beenkar . He hails from the Beenkar Gharana of Indore . He has been a distinguished All India Radio Artiste since the early 1940s . A few years before the Beatles met Ravi Shankar , in 1958 , Khan collaborated with jazz pianist and composer Dave Brubeck . Brubeck who was in Bombay through the state sponsored jazz diplomacy - the Jazz Ambassadors Program was impressed by the improvisation in Indian music and said that the experience accompanying Halim Jaffer Khan led him to play in a different way . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khan also performed with the noted English classical guitarist Julian Bream in 1963 . Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan is perhaps best known for his innovation , Jafferkhani Baaj . He describes it as , a synthesis of precision in technique , systematic thought with a vigorous playing style . Cultural anthropologist and reader at the University of Mumbai , Dr. Kamala Ganesh states : His music making is full of eclectic yet deeply informed choices . He is a thinking musician but puts across his complex views with a simplicity and feeling which demarcate the articulate performer from the articulate theoretician ... In him , one gets an unmistakable sense .. a syncretic tradition . The Indian santoor player Shivkumar Sharma remembers of Khan 's performance of the raga Chaayanat : It was probably in 1955-56 , I was relaxing in my terrace in Jammu . In the stillness of the night I heard the notes of Raga Chaayanat on the sitar emanate from my neighbor 's radio . I immediately noticed that the tone of the sitar was completely different and the style of playing radically unique . I rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was very curious to know who this maestro was . Of ragas such as Kirwani , Abdul Halim Jaffer Khan has been credited with bringing Carnatic ragas into the sitar repertoire : Kanakangi , Latangi , Kirwani , Karaharapriya , Manavati , Ganamurti , etc. but rendering them through a Hindustani sensibility and in the Jafferkhani style . he was the first Hindustani musician to collaborate with Carnatic music in a performance with renowned Veena player Emani Sankara Sastry . His early experimentation with polytonality in Indian classical instrumentation ( which is largely solo performance ) was achieved in his sitar quintet . Khan has had a valuable involvement with Indian cinema . He has composed and played for epic films like ' ' Mughal-e-Azam ' ' , ' ' Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje ' ' , ' ' Goonj Uthi Shehnai ' ' , ' ' Kohinoor ' ' and has collaborated with noted music directors such as Vasant Desai , C. Ramachandra , Madan Mohan and Naushad who has said , he not only enriched film music , but his participation lent prestige to my songs . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sitar in Mumbai , India . His legacy is being carried on by his son Zunain Khan , an accomplished sitarist himself . # Select awards # * ( Sangeet Natak Akademi ) in 2012 * Padma bhushan in 2006 * Shikhar Samman ( Govt. of Madhya Pradesh ) in 1991 * Gaurav Puraskar ( Govt. of Maharashatra ) in 1990 * Sangeet Natak Akademi Award 1987 * Padmashree in 1970 # Video # Narrated by violinist Yehudi Menuhin , Deben Bhattacharya 's film ' ' Raga ' ' features a young virtuosic Halim Jaffer Khan playing raga Sindh Bhairavi. # Select discography # * Live in Jaipur 1968 .

4 ' ' Last Day of the Dinosaurs ' ' is a 2010 Discovery Channel television documentary about the extinction of the dinosaurs . It portrays the Alvarez hypothesis as the cause of extinction . # Production # The dinosaur models created for ' ' Clash of the Dinosaurs ' ' were reused for this program . The ' ' Parasaurolophus ' ' model was used for ' ' Charonosaurus ' ' even though the legs of ' ' Charonosaurus ' ' were shorter than those of ' ' Parasaurolophus ' ' . The ' ' Deinonychus ' ' model was used for ' ' Saurornithoides ' ' ( rather inaccurately , as ' ' Saurornithoides ' ' was slenderer than ' ' Deinonychus ' ' ) , and the ' ' Sauroposeidon ' ' model was used for ' ' Alamosaurus ' ' ( even though ' ' Alamosaurus ' ' had different proportions than ' ' Sauroposeidon ' ' ) . The same ' ' Tyrannosaurus ' ' , ' ' Triceratops ' ' , ' ' Ankylosaurus ' ' , and ' ' Quetzalcoatlus ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different backdrops most of the time than those used in ' ' Clash of the Dinosaurs ' ' . # Plot # The events of Last Day of the Dinosaurs takes place in the what are now Pacific Northwest of North America , central Mexico , and Mongolia during the CretaceousTertiary extinction event . In the Pacific Northwest of North America , towering granite mountains rise above a lush , forested valley full of vegetation including ferns and trees . This is the domain of the ultimate forms of ancient evolution ; dinosaurs . a ' ' Quetzalcoatlus ' ' is a large flying pterosaur , its soaring above the valley during a rainstorm . Down on the valley floor , it spots an unguarded nest of dinosaur eggs . The Tyrannosaurus Rex hatchlings are defenseless . The pterosaur flies down and lands . It goes and eats several of the eggs and chicks . Meanwhile , the father Tyrannosaurus is hunting for prey in the forest when its acute sense of smell alerts it to the intruder at the nest and the dinosaur runs back towards the nest . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrives , it tries to fly off but its huge wings prevent it from flying in the thick forest . The Tyrannosaurus Rex repeatedly lunges and tries to kill it . It finally takes off just as the father Tyrannosaurus lunges , biting off the pterosaur 's foot but it manages to fly away . Later , a male ' ' Triceratops ' ' loses a fight for mating rights against another male Triceratops . Two T.rex hear the commotion and close in to hunt down the loser . The losing Triceratops is suddenly ambushed by two Tyrannosaurus Rex . The dinosaur turns and runs but the Tyrannosaurs follow forcing the slow herbivore to turn and fight . One of the Tyrannosaurus goes behind the triceratops and bites down on its hind legs whilst the second predator bites down on its neck , killing it . The two Tyrannosaurus rex feast on their prey . Meanwhile , in Mongolia a herd of ' ' Charonosaurus ' ' is drinking at a watering hole in a sheltered valley full of bushes . A ' ' Saurornithoides ' ' steals an egg from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Charonosaurus ' ' follows and the raptor hides in a cove . It tries to eat the egg but the mother arrives and bellows its rage . The raptor however has summoned its team mate . Outnumbered , the mother hadrosaur flees but the two raptors race after it . They jump onto the fleeing dinosaur and hold on , biting and shredding the flesh . The hadrosaur finally stumbles and collapses before dying of blood loss . The two Saurornithoides feast on their prey . In what is today central Mexico , a large herd of Alamosaurus is roaming the plains in search of food . Meanwhile , an six-mile wide asteroid formed from the collision of two asteroids 100 million years earlier , enters the Earth 's atmosphere . The scorching asteroid hits the Earth at a 30-degree angle in the Gulf of Mexico , near the Yucatan Peninsula , creating a massive explosion and sending debris flying into the air . One minute after impact , the explosion heats the air temperature near the crash site to 600 degrees Fahrenheit . Hundreds of Alamosaurus are burned alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after impact , seismic shock waves trigger an 11.1 earthquake that rips through the ground and knocks over many other sauropods and stuns them . The stunned sauropods die from internal wounds . And finally , three minutes after impact , the blast pulse wave radiates outward in a perfect circle from the crash site . The blast wave hits and blows away the remaining sauropods even though the dinosaurs weigh 30 tonnes . Most of the eggs in the sauropod 's nests have also been destroyed but some eggs , buried under the cool soil , have survived . The effects of the collision begins to affect the animals in the British Columbia . Ten minutes after impact , an 11.1 magnitude earthquake ripples through the valley floor . Trees begin collapsing and falling debris litters the ground and small mammals run into burrows . Birds fly away . The tremors drive animals to flee from the valley though several Triceratops and Ankylosaurus are engulfed by the 300 degree ejecta cloud thrown up into the air by the asteroid 's impact . The dinosaurs hit by the ejecta cloud are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of microscopic dust , ash and sand particles , it passes over the valley whilst travelling at 10 , 000 miles per hour . Fifteen minutes after impact , the ejecta cloud has spread to the Pacific Northwest from the Gulf of Mexico and threatens to in-circulate the entire planet in ash . A mating pair of ' ' Quetzalcoatlus ' ' tries to fly away , but pieces of flaming debris shower the valley and the male pterosaur is knocked from the sky to his death . The burning rock also injures the female , forcing it to land . Just thirty minutes have passed since the asteroid hit . The soaring temperatures create high humidity in the valley and force the triceratops to keep moving . Many of the dead dinosaurs provide plentiful food for the hungry Tyrannosaurs . Unfortunately , the flaming debris create massive firestorms that devastate forests of the Pacific Northwest . Just one day has passed since the impact . Down in the valley , the air pressure plummets and ignites a firestorm . The tinder dry vegetation ignites instantly . The panicked animals race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and herds of Triceratops flee in terror . The temperature in the valley reaches 1800 degrees F. The trees burn fiercely and Ankylosaurus struggles to get away . The female ' ' Quetzalcoatlus ' ' stands over the male pterosaur 's body and screeches but then panics when the vegetation around it catches fire . The pterosaur manages to take off despite her tattered wings but leaves her dead mate behind . Smaller animals are able to hide underground but the larger animals are forced to flee from the fire . Forty five minutes have passed since the impact . In Mongolia , the superheated ejecta cloud rolls in silently from the east . The burning cloud increases the temperature around Mongolia by several degrees every second . By the time the temperature reached 120 degrees , the hope was shelter . By 170 degrees the survival was measured in minutes . When the temperature reaches 200 degrees no more than 10 seconds . Finally the temperature reaches 300 degrees . Causing the ' ' Charonosaurus ' ' and the ' ' Saurornithoides ' ' to run inside a cave for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally decrease in five hours , the ' ' Saurornithoides ' ' run outside and start feeding on ' ' Charonosaurus ' ' corpse ; soon most of the surviving ' ' Charonosaurus ' ' go to the watering hole although one stays inside the cave . Meanwhile , the ejecta cloud has caused a huge sandstorm due to 300 degree baking temperature that kills all but a single ' ' Charonosaurus ' ' protected in the cave . The others die because their lungs fill up with sand as they struggle to breathe in the sandstorm . They suffocate and are quickly buried by sand and dust . The ' ' Saurornithoides ' ' manage to hide from the worst of the storm , by crouching behind a dead dinosaur but the sandstorm buries their meal . One day has passed since impact . The hungry ' ' Saurornithoides ' ' return to the watering hole , where the last remaining ' ' Charonosaurus ' ' is drinking . The ' ' Saurornithoides ' ' are desperately hungry , yet are weak from their ordeal . One of the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' only to be killed when the dinosaur collapsed on the raptor crushing it with her weight . The remaining ' ' Saurornithoides ' ' resorts to eating the dead body of its companion . Three- four days have passed since impact , food is in critical supply across the entire planet . In the Pacific Northwest , four ' ' Triceratops ' ' head towards an unscathed lush island in search of food . The rest of the continent has been stripped of vegetation by firestorms and falling debris . However , when the asteroid hit the Earth , it caused an earthquake under the ocean . This forms a huge megatsunami , but also causes the water to recede and form a dry land bridge to the island . All but one of the ' ' Triceratops ' ' walk across the land bridge to the island . The weak female ' ' Quetzalcoatlus ' ' lands and eats a stranded fish . Meanwhile , the 300 foot tall megatsunami builds and races towards the shore . The pterosaur takes off but is caught into the vast wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by deluging the island and only one ' ' Triceratops ' ' , which did not cross to the island , has survived . The others are drowned by the flood of water . In days that follow , few dinosaurs remain . Ten days have passed since impact . In Mongolia , the starving ' ' Charonosaurus ' ' stays close to the watering hole , but collapses and dies from inhaling hydrogen sulfide fumes from the bubbling watering hole . The ' ' Saurornithoides ' ' runs up to the dead ' ' Charonosaurus ' ' , but before it can start feeding it too collapses and is killed by the poisonous gas . The refuge was turned into death trap . One and a half month have passed since the impact . In the Pacific Northwest , only a handful of dinosaurs patrol the gray wasteland . An ' ' Ankylosaurus ' ' , severely weakened by hunger finds a small bush but is almost forced to fight a wandering ' ' Triceratops ' ' . Suddenly , a starving ' ' Tyrannosaurus ' ' appears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing the Tyrannosaurus to break of on it its horns and another horn impales the Tyrannosaur in the eye . Despite losing an eye , however , the ' ' Tyrannosaurus ' ' lunges again and bites down on the dinosaur 's neck killing it . It then turns to the Ankylosaurus . The Ankylosaurus swings its tail and strikes the Tyrannosaur 's right leg but its been weakened by hunger and its blow only angers the predator . the Tyrannosaurus flips the weak Ankylosaurus over and rips out its throat so it bleeds to death . But , the tyrannosaurus accidentally trips on the Ankylosaurus 's swishing tail and is impaled on the ' ' Triceratops ' ' horn through its neck as it collapses causing the deadly wound and death . The giants are forced to fight even for a death for even one calorie . Few months has passed since the impact . In Mexico , the first region to be hit by the asteroid , an Alamosaurus baby emerges from an egg that was sheltered away in the ground . All around the world , small handfuls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to start over . However , their species are already considered extinct as they can not replenish their numbers and in the end inbreeding and disease reduced their population to a single dinosaur . Then he died too . And the dynasty with him . But life on Earth is not completely destroyed . Fish and crocodiles were sheltered underwater . Snakes and lizards hid in caves . Birds could fly above or swim away from disasters . Insects , scorpions and spiders took refuge under rocks or hid deep inside tree trunks . One year have passed since the impact . Mammals like Mesodma and Purgatorius hid in burrows and now , leave their shelters the feed on whatever they can find with the dinosaurs out of the way . Three years after impact , the heavy blanket of dust , ash and soot clears away so sunlight can reach the planet again . Several years after impact , ferns and forests carpet the Earth again and set the stage for a new era ; the era of mammals . Their development have long been stopped by the dinosaurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversify ; thousands of years pass and countless species of mammals evolve , live and die until finally , 10,000 species explode across the planet and one species , humans , eventually rule the planet like the dinosaurs once had . In the end , humans would never have existed if an asteroid had not collided with the prehistoric Earth and doomed the dinosaurs to extinction . Only because they died out , can human beings live .

4 The 201011 CONCACAF Champions League Championship Round was played from February to April 2011 . A total of eight teams qualified for the Championship Round from the Group Stage . The championship round draw was conducted on November 1 , 2010 , at the CONCACAF headquarters in New York City . In the quarterfinals , the group winners were assured of playing the second leg at home , and were drawn against the group runners-up , with the only restriction being that they could not face the same team that it played in the Group Stage ( and thus they may face a team from the same association ) . The championship round was played in knockout format . Each tie was played over two legs , and the away goals rule would be used , but not after a tie enters extra time , and so a tie would be decided by penalty shootout if the aggregate score is level after extra time . # Qualified teams # # Bracket # # Quarterfinals # The first legs of the Quarterfinals were played February 2224 , 2011 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

4 Jorge Ferreira Chaves , ( 22 February 1920 - 22 August 1981 ) was a Portuguese architect . Some authors may refer to him as Jorge Chaves or simply Chaves . He was one of the architects responsible , in the latter part of the 1940s , for the establishment of the Modern Movement in Portugal . Professionally active between 1941 and 1981 , he is considered one of the most perfectionist Portuguese architects . From 1946 , in his office , he developed several dozens of projects for continental Portugal , the island of Madeira , Portuguese Guinea and Angola . He also collaborated with some of Lisbon 's most important architectural offices of the first half of the 20th century : those of Joaquim Ferreira , Miguel Jacobetty Rosa and Porfrio Pardal Monteiro. # Biography # Jorge Ribeiro Ferreira Chaves was born on 22 February 1920 , in Ponta do Sol , municipal seat of Ribeira Grande , on the island of Santo Anto in Portuguese Cape Verde . He was the son of Portuguese civil engineer and inventor Raul Pires Ferreira Chaves . From 1931 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture at the ' ' Escola de Belas Artes de Lisboa ' ' ( ) , having entered in 1935 . In 1941 , his degree program was interrupted because of military service during World War II , stationed with Portuguese expeditionary forces on the island of So Miguel in the Azores . He remained on the island until 1944 . He rejoined the School of Fine Arts in 1944 to finish the architecture degree and was awarded the 1946 Jos Luis Monteiro Prize , which included a monetary stipend for students achieving academic excellence . The prize was significant , since it had not been awarded the previous years , and had accumulated . Simultaneously , in 1946-1947 , he attended the Sculpture degree . In 1948 , he graduated in architecture . In his diploma application exam ( ) , in 1953 , Jorge Chaves obtained a significant passing grade : 19 out of 20. # Career # His professional career started during the period of 1943-1956 ; a period which Nuno Portas has designated as the stage of resistance in Portuguese architecture and art . From 1944 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborated with architect Joaquim Ferreira . During this period , he also collaborated , occasionally , with architects Filipe Nobre de Figueiredo and Alberto Soeiro . In 1946 he set up his first office together with his graduation classmate Lus Coelho Borges . He was a member of ' ' ICAT - Iniciativas Culturais Arte e Tcnica ' ' ( ) and also of the ' ' Sociedade Nacional de Belas-Artes ' ' ( ) . He participated in four sessions of the ' ' EGAP Exposies Gerais de Artes Plsticas ' ' ( ) by presenting architectural projects . In 1948 , he participated in the ' ' 1 Congresso Nacional de Arquitectura ' ' ( ) . : One of his post - 48 Congress projects was the Laboratorios Cannobio building , designed in 1948 and built in 1949 . This was one of the first buildings to emerge in the Centre of Lisbon displaying an architectural language clearly engaged with the Modern Movement . : His project for the street corner of Rua Braancamp 7 with Rua Mouzinho da Silveira would also have been so , had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Municipality of Lisbon . In parallel with project activity in his own office , he collaborated with the office of architect Miguel Jacobetty Rosa , between 1948 and 1952 , and did an internship under the direction of architect Hernni Gandra during 1951 . In 1952 he was invited to the office of the architect Porfrio Pardal Monteiro , with whom he worked in designing the Palcio da Rotunda and Sorel buildings , but especially the Hotel Ritz in Lisbon , a remarkable work , for its aesthetic wisdom and excellence of material execution . During architect Porfrio Pardal Monteiro illness and after his death in 1957 , he ensured the continuity of the project of the hotel , by giving assistance to the construction and by heading the phase of execution in a special office built in the site , until its inauguration in 1959 . Although the design of Hotel Ritz was his core activity from 1952 to 1959 , he kept his own office to which he was exclusively dedicated after 1959 . : His most significant architectural production took place during a period caracterized as of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern architecture . During the 1960s , he developed a specific trait , recognizable in such works as the Pastelaria Mexicana in Lisbon or the Hotel Garbe and the Hotel Baleeira in the Algarve and also in housing in Olivais Sul , Rua da Penha de Frana and Rua da Ilha do Prncipe in Lisbon . This latter case has been referred to as perhaps the best urban intervention for housing in Lisbon in that decade . : The Chamber of Commerce of Bissau ( ) , the headquarters of the Guineas Trade , Industry and Agriculture Association ( ) , is considered the most qualified architectural achievement in Bissau during the colonial period . : At the end of the 1950s he produced the remarkable work of Caixa Geral de Depsitos bank in So Pedro do Sul , clearly influenced by the survey on vernacular architecture in Portugal ( ) that was carried out in the late 1950s . : The Pastelaria Mexicana ( a Lisbon cafe and snack-bar ) is a highly remarkable example that led to the limits , in that period and in Portugal , the expressionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century and that developed a phenomenological sense of architectural vision that reached a climax , deemed even exceptional , in the history of architecture in Portugal . : Broken line profiles and non-straight angles , key elements of an international lineage organicism rediscovered in the 1960s , are brilliantly integrated in this perfect example of total design . The process of its classification as a monument of public interest has been ongoing in IGESPAR since 1996 , after an intervention , in that same year , that changed significantly some parts of its architecture . It retains , however , part of the elements that motivated , in 1993 , such a proposed classification . Several of his major works , such as the Pastelaria Mexicana ( cafe ) , the Palissi Galvani shop and the Hotel Florida in Lisbon , the Hotel Garbe , the Hotel da Baleeira and the Hotel Globo in the Algarve or the Chamber of Commerce of Bissau in Guinea-Bissau include conceptually integrated visual arts interventions , some created by himself . The visual artists Jorge Vieira , Jos Escada , Martins Correia , Paulo Guilherme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Querubim Lapa , Mario Costa , Antnio Alfredo and Joo Cmara Leme were invited to intervene in his works ( see PROJECTOS E OBRAS of the Architect Jorge Ferreira Chaves in Pt .

4 ' ' Porky 's Preview ' ' is a short film of animation produced by Leon Schlesinger and directed by Tex Avery . It features Porky Pig . The film was released on 19 April 1941 , distributed by Warner Bros . Pictures . # Plot # Porky Pig has arranged the screening of a film in a film theater for an audience of barnyard animals . The public goes to the ticket booth . A chicken buys tickets for herself and her three children ( eggs ) . A kangaroo tears the tickets ( and even the hand that holds it ) and throws them in his pouch . A firefly usher leads the audience with his hindquarters as bright lamp . A skunk has a scent ( pun on smelling it , and 1 cent of a dollar ) and can not enter , so he goes through the back door . On stage Porky presents the film he made himself . The accompanying music is a version of the flickering that usually introduced cartoons of Looney Tunes . The film turns out to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , minimalist , with settings that seem to have been penciled by a child . After the film , Porky is surprised to see the theatre in shambles the only audience that remaining is the skunk ( whose presence drove away everyone else ) . # Analysis # The basic premise of the film is that a 7-years-old Porky has created a homemade animated cartoon , and demonstrates it to an audience willing to pay an admission fee . The artistic skills of the child are minimal , so the film within a film is depicted in a very simple style . Effectively serving as a parody of its art form . All fictional characters within it are drawn as stick figures , while the animation style is reminiscent of a flip book . For this film within a film , Tex Avery uses a series of blackout gags . Carl Stalling accompanies each joke with a tune already familiar to the audience . Among them are ' ' La Cucaracha ' ' ( first mentioned c. 1819 ) , ' ' Aloha Oe ' ' ( 1878 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written between 1875 and 1895 ) . Stalling also parodies the typical music score of shorts produced by Warner Bros . Cartoons . The credits of the film within a film makes use of ' ' The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down ' ' ( 1937 ) , but the familiar tune is simplified . Giving the impression that it is played by an amateur . A number of notes are repeated , in the style of a broken record which repeats over and over . The film includes some references to war . When a skunk approaches the box office , the lady working there wears a gas mask to endure its scent . The self-portrait of Porky is marked as draft No. . # Censorship # When aired on TV ( particularly when aired on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network ) , the September in the Rain segment is cut .

4 AT&amp;T Corp . v. Excel Communications , Inc. , 172 F.3d 1352 ( Fed . Cir. 1999 ) was a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the decision of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware , which had granted summary judgment to Excel Communications , Inc. and decided that AT&amp;T Corp . had failed to claim statutory subject matter with U.S. Patent No. 5,333,184 ( the ' 184 patent ) under . The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit remanded the case for further proceedings . Along with State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group , this case was the most referred case on business method patent with a ' useful concrete and tangible result ' test by US Courts until ' ' In re Bilski ' ' . # Background # # The Two Sides # AT&amp;T Corp . , originally the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph , is an American telecommunications company that provides voice , video , data , and Internet telecommunications and professional services to businesses , consumers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc. and its subsidiary AT&amp;T Communications still provides long distance service across the United States . **6;105978;br was founded in 1988 by Dallas entrepreneur Kenny Troutt as a long distance reseller in the US telecom sector at the birth of telecom deregulation . It started its business by selling franchises through the business model of network marketing or multi-level marketing ( MLM ) . # Event History # In 1992 , the ' 184 patent was filed and in 1994 , the patent status was granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) . In 1996 , AT&amp;T filed a patent infringement suit against Excel , including some specific method or process claims related to the step of generating a message record for an interexchange call between an originating subscriber and a terminating subscriber , and the use of primary interexchange carrier ( PIC ) indicator in the message record . On March 27 , 1998 , the District Court of Delaware concluded that the invention was not patentable subject matter because the claims implicitly recite a mathematical algorithm . The trial court , on summary judgment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to qualify as statutory subject matter . On April 14 , 1999 , the U.S. Court of Appeals Federal Circuit found that the claimed subject matter was properly within the statutory scope of , and reversed the district court 's judgment of invalidity on this ground and remanded the case for further proceedings . # #Summary of the U.S. Patent No. 5,333,184# # The U.S. Patent No. 5,333,184 ( or the ' 184 patent ) , entitled ' Message Recording for Telephone Systems ' , described a method to take advantage of adding more data into a message record in order to provide appropriate billing for subscribers , based on whether or not the subscriber and call recipient subscribe to the same long-distance carrier . This data is called Primary interexchange carrier indicator ( PIC ) . In a direct-dialed long distance call , a call-related data and message record , named automatic message account ( AMA ) , was generated . It includes further information , such as the originating and terminating telephone numbers , and the length of time of the call . The records with AMAs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers and reformatted for processing and billing , which later comes to customer in form of hard copy via mails. # Opinion of the Federal Circuit Court # In their analysis , the Federal Court first refers to the definition of patentable invention in the language of , and found that AT&amp;T 's business method fell in the process category and the patent claims fell within the judicially created mathematical algorithm exception to statutory subject matter . In addition , because the system takes data representing discrete dollar amounts through a series of mathematical calculations to determine a final share price a useful , concrete , and tangible result , the Court affirmed that the processing system proposed by AT&amp;T was patentable subject matter and should be protected . Process is defined in as : a process , art or method , and includes a new use of a known process , machine , manufacture , composition of matter , or any new and useful improvement thereof . However , the court consider the scope of to be the same regardless of the form - machine or process - in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method claims containing mathematical algorithms are patentable subject matter only if there is a physical transformation or conversion of subject matter from one state into another . In response , the Court explained that physical transformation can be considered as long as it results in an useful , concrete and tangible outcome/application . The court relied on the Supreme Court 's opinion in Diamond v. Diehr , which said : # ( ... ) when a claim containing a mathematical formula implements or applies that formula in a structure or process which , when considered as a whole , is performing a function which the patent laws were designed to protect ( e. g. , transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing ) , then the claim satisfies the requirements of 101 . # Although the District Court of Delaware held the patent invalid under the mathematical algorithm exception , the Federal Court referred to several cases including In re Alappat and State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group and reversed the District Court 's opinion and considered that at the time of the trial court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mathematical algorithm issue . # Impact # This case removes the need for mathematical algorithms to be involved in physical elements or process to be eligible as patentable subject matter . The case also moves the well-known Freeman-Walter-Abele Test to an outdated judicial status and reaffirms that a mathematical algorithm that produces useful , concrete and tangible result is a statutory subject matter and patentable . However , AT&amp;T did receive some criticism as a patent troll in press coverage of the case . To date , before granting a patent status to a claimed invention , USPTO personnel must examine if the claim(s) in the invention falls within at least one of the four enumerated categories of patentable subject matter recited in ( i.e. , process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter ) . Evidently , after the State Street case this case is one of the most referred cases in courts related to business method inventions . However , it is also still arguable how to define patentable business method inventions and if the useful , concrete and tangible result test is sufficient to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most famous cases that fell into this controversial situation after AT&amp;T v. Excel . In this particular case , the Federal Circuit agreed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on rejecting the patent claims by In re Bernard L. Bilski on a business method and even stated that those portions of our opinions in State Street .. relying solely on a ' useful concrete and tangible result ' analysis should no longer be relied on . As the result , although referring to previous well-known cases , In re Bilski still failed to persuade the judges to view his claims patentable . With this case , the Federal Court significantly narrowed down the patent eligibility when looking at business method innovation . However , the Supreme Court later with majority opinion affirmed that the door to patent eligibility remains open for business methods , as well as emerging technologies , so long as such inventions do not run afoul of the three well-established exceptions to patent-eligibility ( ' laws of nature , physical phenomena , and abstract ideas ' ) , as well as ( novelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly described ) . # References # # See more # * ' ' United States Patent and Trademark Office ' ' * ' ' ' ' * ' ' ' '

4 Martin Dibble is a fictional character from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera ' ' Home and Away ' ' , played by Craig Thomson . He made his first on-screen appearance on 17 January 1988 , the show 's pilot episode . He left the show on 3 April 1990 , but returned for guest stints in 2000 and 2002. # Creation and casting # In 1987 , ' ' Home and Away ' ' producers asked Thomson to audition for a role , after they watched him in an advertisement for soft drinks . Thomson auditioned alongside Adam Willits , while Thomson secured the role of Martin , Willits went on to play Steven Matheson . Of his casting Thomson said they went along to the auditions and got the parts , there 's not much to tell really . ' ' Home and Away ' ' was Thomson 's first television role . When Thomson won the role of Martin he was thankful because he had not achieved high grades in his studies . After he had read his first scripts for Martin , Thomson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is portrayed as a yobbo and Thomson believed that the area was ideal to observe yobbos socialising . He told a writer from ' ' Look-in ' ' that Martin was directly based on the people he had seen on his trip . # Character development # In his book ' ' Home and Away Annual ' ' , Kesta Desmond describes Martin as a beach bum and who a big ego because he sees himself as one of the most attractive men in Summer Bay . When Martin faces rejection from females who do appreciate his charm , his confidence remains undented . As Martin is also characterised as a yob , Thomson said that members of the public assume he is going to behave like Martin . Thomson described Martin as being completely over the top , and very different from the rest of the cast . I really like playing comedy . Thomson later said that Martin 's like every other bully , he fancies himself as a boxer and thinks he 's tough . In fact , he 's a coward . In 1990 , Thomson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by his brain . Thomson told the reporter from ' ' Look-in ' ' that he was nothing like his character . Martin does not know how to have a good time because he is a dag ; and is forever thinking up ideas which eventually fail . Martin also has the tendency to act quite selfish and he is very greedy . Thomson said that he disliked his character 's greediness even though he always knew that was how ' ' Home and Away ' ' intended to portray him . Martin is not really a bad guy either , and Thomson said that everyone needed to treat him as a bit of a joke and that he would never chose to spend time with Martin . Martin forms an on-screen duo with the character of Lance Smart ( Peter Vroom ) , Thomson said that the characters are ' ' Home and Away 's ' ' answer to Laurel and Hardy . Like Martin , Lance is not popular with females and even their closest friends think they are unattractive . They are portrayed as a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The characters have a general dislike for the local males who enjoy surfing . They become their great nemesis because they manage to get all the girls . As Martin believes he is the most irresistible male in Summer Bay , Lance is so impressed by Martin that he believes he is actually irresistible . Thomson said that the duo stand out a lot because of their over-the-top nature . While Vroom felt they rarely got serious scenes because they were mostly involved in comedic storylines . Vroom criticised the writing Martin and Lance received because he did not think it represented how young people behave . ' ' Home and Away 's ' ' critics also scrutinised the writing for a lack of realism . Vroom said Usually Lance and Martin are drinking yobs , but they 're not allowed to swear which is not so realistic . While Thomson said the serial 's early evening time slot often caused dialogue to be censored . Vroom added that Lance and Martin are definitely drinkers and if it was n't for the timeslot they would be into marijuana too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible and cater for young viewers . In early 1990 , Thomson told a reporter from ' ' TV Life ' ' that he was thinking about leaving the series to launch his music career . Thomson later left to promote his band the Big Blue World in London . He told ' ' Look-in 's ' ' reporter that he would not return to ' ' Home and Away ' ' again . He also believed that there was nowhere left for his character to go . Thomson added he 's had his day really , throughout the whole show he 's done so many things , there 's not much else left for him to try . However , Thomson returned to filming in 2000 when Martin and Lance arrive to attend Sally Fletcher 's ( Kate Ritchie ) wedding . # Storylines # Martin and Lance watch new arrivals in town Carly Morris ( Sharyn Hodgson ) , Lynn Davenport ( Helena Bozich ) and Sally ; he is instantly taken with Carly .

As a result , he ends up getting into a fight with Steven . Martin saves Carly from drowning but uses up the goodwill when he stops the object of her desires Matt Wilson ( Greg Benson ) from visiting her . When Martin has another clash with Bobby , during which her school dress is ripped , the girls decide to get their own back on Lance and Martin by letting the handbrake off their van . The van rolls into the car being driven by school Principal Walter Bertram ( Owen Weingott ) , leaving him hospitalised with minor injuries . Since it is their work van , they end up being fired . Martin and Lance blame the school 's deputy principal , Donald Fisher ( Norman Coburn ) , whose brother is their employer , so they get their revenge by putting jellyfish in his car .

As punishment , Alf Stewart ( Ray Meagher ) , who owns the local bottle shop , refuses to serve them alcohol so they try brewing their own . They accidentally get Donald 's cat drunk and has to sober him up before Donald finds out . Martin then joins a band that Frank Morgan ( Alex Papps ) and Ruth Stewart ( Justine Clarke ) put together as the bassist and is caught in the crossfire when the couple fall out .

Martin and Lance decided to start up a western act instead and play it for the Summer Bay High students , who like the cheesy act but give up on idea after they fail with a different audience Martin begins sharing a flat with Frank and Lance 's cousin Narelle ( Amanda Newman-Phillips ) . When Lance has a big win on the lottery , Martin begins costing him money , leaving the keys in his new sports car so it is stolen and vandalised and fails to pay the insurance . The pair fall foul of conman Gary Samuels ( Darius Perkins ) when he tricks them into investing in a fake nightclub development and teams up with several other locals to bring him down .

They are further humiliated when Nina reveals to the press that she had deliberately chosen two no-hopers to prove that a good promoter could make anyone a success . Following rejection from Roo , Martin bounces back by dating Leanne Dunn ( Kylie Foster ) but when Celia begins giving her lessons to make her more ladylike , he loses interest . Martin tries to get her to break up with him , but instead she thinks he wants to get married . Unimpressed by his behaviour , Leanne starts dressing up in revealing clothes to make him break it off , only for him to prefer her that way . Leanne 's ex , Meat Axe ( Joseph Dicker ) , returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons from Steven , Martin takes a serious beating until Leanne steps in and stops the fight . She then leaves with Meat Axe . Stacey agrees to hire Martin if he manages to impress a client . Tom and Frank accidentally get Peter Bedford ( Bevan Wilson ) , one of the clients offside ; Martin charms him back and is given a job for a trial period . When a group of Japanese clients take a liking to Martin , Stacey and Tom are unable to fire him so they give him the grand-sounding but fairly lowly post of transport manager . Martin takes over the office when Tom went missing but accidentally shreds an important file and is sacked . Martin asks Lance 's girlfriend Marilyn Chambers ( Emily Symons ) to set him up on a date with one of her friends , who turns out to be a bookish , nerdy girl named Greta ( Jodie Gilles ) .

They assume he is dying but in fact he is joining the army and was discussing his medical . They ask Carly , who Martin has long been attracted to , to go on a date with him and kiss him to make his remaining time in Summer Bay pleasurable . She reluctantly agrees and is annoyed when she discovers the truth . Martin thanks Lance for arranging it before saying a fond farewell . Lance later joins Martin in the army .

4 The Fermilab Holometer in Illinois is under construction and is intended to be the world 's most sensitive laser interferometer when complete , surpassing the sensitivity of the GEO600 and LIGO systems , and theoretically able to detect holographic fluctuations in spacetime . According to the director of the project , the Holometer should be capable of detecting fluctuations in the light of a single attometer , meeting or exceeding the sensitivity required to detect the smallest units in the universe called Planck units . Fermilab states : Everyone is familiar these days with the blurry and pixelated images , or noisy sound transmission , associated with poor internet bandwidth . The Holometer seeks to detect the equivalent blurriness or noise in reality itself , associated with the ultimate frequency limit imposed by nature . Craig Hogan , a particle astrophysicist at Fermilab , states about the experiment , What were looking for is when the lasers lose step with each other . Were trying to detect the smallest unit in the universe . This is really great fun , a sort of old-fashioned physics experiment where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicist Hartmut Grote of the Max Planck Institute in Germany states that although he is skeptical that the apparatus will successfully detect the holographic fluctuations , if the experiment is successful it would be a very strong impact to one of the most open questions in fundamental physics . It would be the first proof that space-time , the fabric of the universe , is quantized . The hypothesis that holographic noise may be observed in this manner has been criticized on the grounds that the theoretical framework used to derive the noise violates Lorentz-invariance . Lorentz-invariance violation is however very strongly constrained already , an issue that has been very unsatisfactorily addressed in the mathematical treatment . # Experimental description # The Holometer will consist of two power-recycled Michelson interferometers , similar to the LIGO instruments . The interferometers will be able to be operated in two spatial configurations , termed nested and back-to-back . According to Hogan 's hypothesis , in the nested configuration the interferometers ' beamsplitters should appear to wander in step with each other ( that is , the wandering should be ' ' correlated ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering of the beamsplitters should be uncorrelated . The presence or absence of the correlated wandering effect in each configuration can be determined by cross-correlating the interferometers ' outputs .

Athenais was related to the previous Kings and monarchs of Cappadocia , as her paternal aunt Laodice of Cappadocia was a Queen ; her paternal cousins : Ariarathes VI , Ariarathes VII , Ariarathes VIII and her paternal half-brother Ariarathes IX served as previous Kings of Cappadocia . Through her Seleucid and paternal lineage , Athenais was related to the ancestors of Ariarathes VI . Ariobarzanes II reigned as King of Cappadocian from 63 BC-62 BC until his assassination in c. 51 BC . There are various surviving honorific inscriptions dedicated to Athenais . During their marriage Athenais bore Ariobarzanes II two sons : Ariobarzanes III Eusebes Philoromaios and Ariarathes X Eusebes Philadelphos . Her sons would serve as among the last Kings of Cappadocia . The name ' Ariobarzanes ' was not just a name that was from her husbands family , it was a name from her family .

Athenais became known as the Queen-Mother of Cappadocia . During the rule of Ariobarzanes III , Roman Governor of Cilicia Marcus Tullius Cicero warned the King that Athenais could be a potential enemy to him . Ciceros warning was based on Athenais jealousy , about two nobles called Methras and Athenaeus . They were ministers and favorites of her first son and they were through Athenais jealousy were driven out from the Cappadocian Royal Court . However Methras and Athenaeus were later recalled by Cicero . Athenais jealousy was a part of her failed plot to depose her first son from his throne and put her second son in his place . Cicero and Ariobarzanes III caught Athenais out and Ariobarzanes III was very saddened about his mothers actions . Ariabarzanes III removed his mother from power and her fate afterwards is unknown .

Series of in situ photos taken in big cities and famous sites with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 15 centimeters off the ground . * Impressions consists of big size paint impressions on canvas of street furnitures ( e.g. public benches ) . * Hypermodern Times : Under this title taken from sociologists , Djan Silveberg develops humorous and critical works that reflect the beginning of 21st century , with all its excesses and societys specificities. # Characteristics of his work # Playful , humour and narrative poetry Two main recurring elements build up the artistic work of Djan Silveberg through the various forms of expressions he uses : The narrative poetry , which comes from the literary world , is the expression of feelings through his works that can be tracked down as a kind of story-telling . The critical point of view of meaning and values . The quest for oneself and the other . This narrative poetry not only comes from words but also images and forms . A discrete , sometimes cutting or dark kind of humour is the second aspect of Djan Silvebergs artistic approach . Some of his works also play on words or symbols , with historical or literary references , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing or rejection reactions , especially to trigger the will to come aboard his world . # References # # Publications # ' ' Quelques Vers de Rome MXMXCIV ' ' , Odes &amp; Chimeres editions , 1997 , ISBN 2-911795-00-8

4 From its earliest days , Christianity has been challenged to reconcile the violence of the Christian Bible with the idea of a loving God . Ra'anan S. Boustan asserts that ( v ) iolence can be found throughout the pages of the Hebrew Bible ( Old Testament ) and the New Testament . Philip Jenkins describes the Bible as overflowing with texts of terror . In response to these charges of violence in their scriptures , many Christian theologians and apologists respond that the God of the Old Testament is a violent god whereas the God of the New Testament is a peaceful and loving god , an exegesis first proposed by Marcion of Sinope . This approach is challenged by those who point out that there are also passages in the New Testament that tolerate , condone and even encourage the use of violence . For example , Terence Freitheim describes the Old Testament as a book filled with ... the violence of God . He asserts that while the New Testament does not have the same reputation , it too is filled with violent words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament are complicit in this violence . John Hemer asserts that the two primary approaches that Christian teaching uses to deal with the problem of violence in the Old Testament are : # Concentrate more on the many passages where God is depicted as loving much of Isaiah , Hosea , Micah , Deuteronomy. # Explain how the idea of God as a violent punishing war-monger is all part of the historical and cultural conditioning of the author and that we can ignore it in good faith , especially in the light of the New Testament . In opposition to these two approaches , Hemer argues that to ignore or explain away the violence found in the Old Testament is a mistake . He asserts that Violence is not peripheral to the Bible it is central , in many ways it is the issue , because of course it is the human problem . He concludes by saying that The Bible is in fact the story of the slow , painstaking and sometimes faltering escape from the idea of a God who is violent to a God who is love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthews assert that many studies of violence in the Bible focus on violence in the Old Testament while ignoring or giving little attention to the New Testament . They find even more troubling those studies that lift up the New Testament as somehow containing the antidote for Old Testament violence . This apparent contradiction in the sacred scriptures between a God of vengeance and a God of love are the basis of a tension between the irenic and eristic tendencies of Christianity that has continued to the present day . # Old Testament # The principle of an eye for an eye is often referred to using the Latin phrase ' ' lex talionis ' ' , the law of like . The meaning of the principle eye for an eye is that a person who has injured another person returns the offending action to the originator in compensation . At the root of this principle is that one of the purposes of the law is to provide equitable retribution for an offended party . Christian interpretation of the Biblical passage has been heavily influenced by the quotation from Leviticus ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mount . In the Expounding of the Law ( part of the Sermon on the Mount ) , Jesus urges his followers to turn the other cheek when confronted by violence : # You have heard that it was said , An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . But I say to you , do not resist an evildoer . If anyone strikes you on the right cheek , turn to him the other also . ( , NRSV ) # This saying of Jesus is frequently interpreted as criticism of the Old Testament teaching , and often taken as implying that an eye for an eye encourages excessive vengeance rather than an attempt to limit it . It was one of the points of ' fulfilment or destruction ' of the Hebrew law which the Church father St. Augustine already discussed in his Contra Faustum , Book XIX . Dr Ian Guthridge cited many instances of genocide in the Old Testament : thus leading many scholars to characterize the exterminations as genocide . Niels Peter Lemche asserts that European colonialism in the 19th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extermination . The image of a violent God in Hebrew scriptures that condoned and even ordered violence posed a problem for some early Christians who saw this as a direct contradiction to the God of peace and love attested to in the New Testament . Perhaps the most famous example was Marcion who dropped the Hebrew scriptures from his version of the Bible because he found in them a violent God . Marcion saw the God of the Old Testament , the Demiurge and creator of the material universe , as a jealous tribal deity of the Jews , whose law represented legalistic reciprocal justice and who punishes mankind for its sins by suffering and death . Marcion wrote that the God of the Old Testament was an uncultured , jealous , wild , belligerent , angry and violent God , who has nothing in common with the God of the New Testament .. For Marcion , the God about whom Jesus was an altogether different being , a universal God of compassion and love , who looks upon humanity with benevolence and mercy . Marcion argued that Christianity should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as to say that Jesus mission was to overthrow Demiurgethe fickle , cruel , despotic God of the Old Testamentand replace Him with the Supreme God of Love whom Jesus came to reveal . Marcion 's teaching was repudiated by Tertullian in five treatises titled Against Marcion and Marcion was ultimately excommunicated by the Church of Rome . The difficulty posed by the apparent contradiction between the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament continues to perplex pacifist Christians to this day . Eric Seibert asserts that , ( f ) or many Christians , involvement in warfare and killing in the pages of the Old Testament is incontrovertible evidence that such activities have God 's blessing . .. Attitudes like this are terribly troubling to religious pacifists and demonstrate the kind of problems these texts create for them . Some modern-day pacifists such as Charles Raven have argued that the Church should repudiate the Old Testament as an unchristian book , thus echoing the approach taken by Marcion in the 2nd century . # Lex talionis # The meaning of the principle eye for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person returns the offending action to the originator in compensation . The exact Latin ( ' ' lex talionis ' ' ) to English translation of this phrase is actually The law of retaliation . At the root of this principle is that one of the purposes of the law is to provide equitable retribution for an offended party . The phrase an eye for an eye ( Hebrew ' ' ayin tachat ayin ' ' eye under eye ) is a quotation from several passages of the Hebrew Bible. ( , , and ) in which a person who has injured the eye of another is instructed to give the value of his or her own eye in compensation . It defined and restricted the extent of retribution in the laws of the Torah . The English word ' ' talion ' ' means a punishment identical to the offense , from the Latin ' ' talio ' ' . The principle of an eye for an eye is often referred to using the Latin phrase ' ' lex talionis ' ' , the law of talion . The expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Verses such as and which are sometimes rendered in Christian translations by an eye for an eye or similar have the expression ' ' ayin tachat ayin ' ' meaning each and every eye ( verbatim eye under eye ) in the original Hebrew . The verses where the expression occurs list situations for which fines are imposed to compensate injury and state that each and every injury must be compensated . The Talmud ( in ' ' Bava Kamma ' ' , 83b-84a ) , explicitly discusses the nature of this monetary compensation in tort cases and argues against the reinterpretation by Sadducees that the Bible verses refer to physical retaliation in kind , using the argument that such an interpretation would be inapplicable to blind or eyeless offenders . Since the Torah requires that penalties be universally applicable , the phrase can not be interpreted in this manner but that , applying the same pragmatic revisionism , a similar value injury , such as losing a hand or foot could be inflicted if the offender did not have any eyes . Moreover , personal retribution is explicitly forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the social magistrate ( usually in the form of regional courts ) . # The Oral Law explains , based upon the biblical verses , that the Bible mandates a sophisticated five-part monetary form of compensation , consisting of payment for Damages , Pain , Medical Expenses , Incapacitation , and Mental Anguish which underlies many modern legal codes . Some rabbinic literature explains , moreover , that the expression , An eye for an eye , etc. suggests that the perpetrator deserves to lose his own eye , but that biblical law treats him leniently . Paraphrased from the Union of Orthodox Congregations , . # However , the Torah also discusses a form of direct reciprocal justice , where the phrase ' ' ayin tachat ayin ' ' makes another appearance ( ) . Here , the Torah discusses false witnesses who conspire to testify against another person . The Torah requires the court to do to him as he had conspired to do to his brother ( ) . Assuming the fulfillment of certain technical criteria ( such as the sentencing of the accused whose punishment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punish the conspirators with exactly the same punishment through which they had planned to harm their fellow , the court carries out this direct reciprocal justice ( including when the punishment constitutes the death penalty ) . Otherwise , the offenders receive lashes ( ' ' Makot ' ' 1:1 ; ibid. , Bab . Talmud 2a based on critical exegesis of ) . The Torah , as it exists today , clearly proscribes an eye for an eye whether in the context of revenge or compensation . However there seems to be is no such proscription for false witnesses who have colluded in a conspiracy . ( There is one case where the Torah states and you shall cut off her hand . The sages of the Talmud understood the literal meaning of this verse as referring to a case where the woman is attacking a man in potentially lethal manner . This verse teaches that , although one must intervene to save the victim , one may not kill a lethal attacker if it is possible to neutralize that attacker through non-lethal injury Sifrei ; Maimonides ' ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hil . ' ' Rotze'ach u'Sh'mirat Nefesh ' ' 1:7 . Regardless , there is no verse that even appears to mandate injury to the eye , tooth , or foot . ) Thus , it is impossible to read an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth literally in the context of a conspiratorial witness . discusses the only form of remotely reciprocal justice not carried out directly by the court , where , under very limited circumstances , someone found guilty of negligent manslaughter may be killed by a relative of the deceased who takes on the role of redeemer of blood . In such cases , the court requires the guilty party to flee to a designated city of refuge . While the guilty party is there , the redeemer of blood may not kill him . If , however , the guilty party illegally forgoes his exile , the redeemer of blood , as an accessory of the court , may kill the guilty party . Nevertheless , the provision of the redeemer of blood does not serve as true reciprocal justice , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgoes his exile . Furthermore , intentional killing does not parallel negligent killing and thus can not serve directly as a reciprocal punishment for manslaughter , but as a penalty for escaping punishment ( ' ' Makot ' ' 7a13a ) . ( According to traditional Jewish Law , application of these laws requires the presence and maintenance of the biblically designated cities of refuge , as well as a conviction in an eligible court of 23 judges as delineated by the Torah and Talmud . The latter condition is also applicable for any capital punishment . These circumstances have not existed for approximately 2,000 years . ) Christian interpretation of the Biblical passage has been heavily influenced by the quotation from Leviticus ( 19:18 above ) in Jesus of Nazareth 's Sermon on the Mount . In the Expounding of the Law ( part of the Sermon on the Mount ) , Jesus urges his followers to turn the other cheek when confronted by violence : # You have heard that it was said , An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . But I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone strikes you on the right cheek , turn to him the other also . ( , NRSV ) # This saying of Jesus is frequently interpreted as criticism of the Old Testament teaching , and often taken as implying that an eye for an eye encourages excessive vengeance rather than an attempt to limit it . It was one of the points of ' fulfilment or destruction ' of the Hebrew law which the Church father St. Augustine already discussed in his Contra Faustum , Book XIX . As noted in previous sections , the natural tendency of people is for revenge and in the extreme . You hurt me or offended me so I am going to take an arm and a leg or sue you for all you have ! Although both the Hammurabi Code and Hebrew Law both had death penalties for many crimes , the eye for eye was to restrict compensation to the value of the loss ; in the hammurabi code as being literal , and in the Hebrew Law applying monetarily . Thus , it might be better read ' only one eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guthridge cited many instances of genocide in the Old Testament : cquotethe Bible also contains the horrific account of what can only be described as a biblical holocaust . For , in order to keep the chosen people apart from and unaffected by the alien beliefs and practices of indigenous or neighbouring peoples , when God commanded his chosen people to conquer the Promised Land , he placed city after city ' under the ban -which meant that every man , woman and child was to be slaughtered at the point of the sword . Thus we read in the Book of Numbers that the Jews waged the campaign against Midian , as Yahweh had ordered Moses , and they put every male to death .. the sons of Israel took the Midianite women captive with their young children , and plundered all their cattle , all their flocks and all their goods . They set fire to the towns where they lived and all their encampments .. Then , when they took the captives , spoil and booty to Moses ... , Moses was enraged ... ' why have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill all the male children . Kill also all the women who have slept with a man . Spare the lives only of the young girls who have not slept with a man , and take them for yourselves . . Similarly in the Book of Deuteronomy , when the Jews attacked Sihon 's Amorite kingdom , Yahweh our God delivered him over to us .. We captured all his cities and laid whole towns under ban , men , women and children ; we spared nothing but the livestock which we took as our spoil . Likewise in the Transjordanian kingdom of Og , king of Bashan : We captured all his towns at that time .. Sixty towns .. We laid them under ban .. - the whole town , men , women and children , under the ban . . Sometimes , the ban could vary ; for in a later chapter of the same book , we read that if ( a town ) refuses peace and offers resistance , .. Yahweh your God shall deliver it unto your power and you are to put all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , the livestock and all that the town contains , all its spoil , you may take for yourselves as booty . . In the Book of Joshua , we read about the most famous case of all - the fall of Jericho : Then Yahweh said to Joshua , ' Now I am delivering Jericho and its king into your hands . So , when the walls of Jericho came tumbling down , the Jewish warriors enforced the ban on everything in the town : men and women , young and old , even the oxen and sheep and donkeys , massacring them all . The same for the people of Ai ( Bible ) The same in southern Canaan , which Yahweh gave into the power of Israel ; and Israel struck every living creature there with the edge of the sword , and left none alive . The Old Testament contains passages in which God commands the Israelites to exterminate seven Canaanite nations , and describes several wars of extermination that annihilated entire cities or groups of peoples . Examples include the story of Amalekites ( , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the Midianites ( ) , and the battle of Jericho ( ) . The extent of extermination is described in the scriptural passage which orders the Israelites to not leave alive anything that breathes completely destroy them . thus leading many scholars to characterize the exterminations as genocide . Niels Peter Lemche asserts that European colonialism in the nineteenth century was ideologically based on the Old Testament narratives of conquest and extermination . Arthur Grenke claims that the view or war expressed in Deuteronomy contributed to the destruction of Native Americans and to the destruction of European Jewry . # New Testament # Gedaliahu G. Stroumsa asserts that ' irenic ' and ' eristic ' tendencies ( i.e. peace and strife ) co-exist in the New Testament . Stroumsa cites the Sermon on the Mount ( , ) as an example of an irenic passage in the New Testament . As examples of eristic scriptures , Stroumsa cites the following Gospel passages : : Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth ; I have But to bring a sword : I came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already kindled ! Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth ? No , I tell you , but rather division . : And he said unto them , When I sent you without purse , and scrip , and shoes , lacked ye any thing ? And they said , Nothing . Then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and Sell your cloak and buy a sword Other sayings and acts of Jesus that have been cited as examples of tacit acceptance of violence include : the absence of any censure of the soldier who asks Jesus to heal his servant , his cleansing of the Temple , and through his Apostles , baptising a Roman Centurion who is never asked to first give up arms . W.E . Addis cites the case of the soldiers instructed by in their duties by St. John the Baptist , and that of the military men whom Christ and His Apostles loved and familiarly conversed with ( , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unlawful , sufficiently prove the point . According to Steve Friesen , the apocalyptic Book of Revelation has been employed in a wide array of settings , many of which have been lethal .

4 Andr de Gouveia ( Beja , 1497 - 9 June 1548 , Coimbra ) was a Portuguese humanist and pedagogue during the Renaissance . Andr de Gouveia became one of the first Portuguese to study in the Collge Sainte-Barbe , in Paris , which was then directed by his uncle Diogo de Gouveia . After attending six years in ' ' maitrise des Arts ' ' he earned a degree as doctor in theology , and simultaneously , began teaching at the college . Starting in 1530 , due to the many diplomatic missions that kept his uncle away , Andr was entrusted by him with the direction of the Collge . As an adept of the most advanced religious ideas , Andr de Gouveia bent Saint Barbe into the Humanist ideals . There in 1531 he appointed regent Nicolas Cop . After Cop 's contested inaugural address as rector of the university in 1533 , he was appointed rector of the University of Paris for the college of arts ( liberal arts ) , introducing new rules for transparency and fairness among all disciplines , but soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the College of Guienne , in Bordeaux . He had been invited by the municipal authorities , and was given full freedom to modernize the old college . On arrival , Gouveia proclaimed that he would not recognize differences of creed in staff and pupils , many of whom showed sympathy to the new doctrines of the Reform . There , in 1539 , Gouveia welcomed George Buchanan , appointing him professor of Latin . Gouveia 's stay at the College de Guyenne lasted until 1547 , attracting students like tienne de La Botie and Michel de Montaigne , who later in his ' ' Essays ' ' described Gouveia as ... behind comparison the greatest principal in France . The fame of the teaching -mainly grammar , classical literature , history and philosophy - was such that , in 1552 , Italian scholar and physician Julius Caesar Scaliger sent his sons to the college , including Joseph Justus Scaliger . Andr de Gouveia returned to Portugal at the invitation of King John III , accompanied by a group of foreign teachers , to head the new College of the Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Buchanan , Jernimo Osrio , Nicolas de Grouchy , Guillaume Gurante and lie Vinet , who came to be decisive for the disclosure of contemporary research of Pedro Nunes . However , Gouveia did not remained for long in office as president of the college , as he died in June 1548 . Rivalry between the secular trends of the new Bordeaux teachers , and the more orthodox method of the Parisian school headeds by Diogo de Gouveia led to several teachers , including George Buchanan , to face inquisition : Gouveia kept numerous contacts with European scholars and Portuguese businesses when he was in France . At odds with his uncle Diogo , Andr was suspected of Lutheranism . He left a few written texts , in particular his views are represented regulations of the Collge de Guyenne , published by Elie Vinet in 1583 under the title ' ' Schola Aquitanica ' ' . Andr de Gouveia was brother to humanist and teacher Antnio de Gouveia.

4 The Easterlin hypothesis ( Easterlin 1969 , 1973 ) states that the positive relationship between income and fertility is dependent on relative income . The hypothesis as formulated by Richard Easterlin presumes that material aspirations are determined by experiences rooted in family background : he assumes first that young couples try to achieve a standard of living equal to or better than they had when they grew up . This is called relative status . If income is high relative to aspirations and jobs are plentiful , it will be easier to marry young and have more children and still match that standard of living . But when jobs are scarce , couples who try to keep that standard of living will wait to get married and have fewer children . Children are normal goods once this influence of family background is controlled . For Easterlin , the size of the cohort is a critical determinant of how easy it is to get a good job . A small cohort means less competition , a large cohort means more competition to worry about . The assumptions blend economics @ @ @ @ @ @

Each session groups together invited and submitted talks on a conference theme and ends with a talk by an invited discussant followed by an open discussion by the entire conference audience . Since the second conference in 1989 , there have also been one or more poster sessions , which also are plenary . Conferences generally have between four and six themes , which are broadly defined in order to bring together speakers and commentators from different disciplines and theoretical backgrounds . # Publications # The proceedings of the Conference on Laboratory Phonology were published as Papers in Laboratory Phonology by Cambridge University Press from 1991 ( Vol 1 ) to 2004 ( Vol 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renamed to Laboratory Phonology and published by Mouton de Gruyter . After the publication of Laboratory Phonology 10 in 2010 , the book series was replaced by the journal Laboratory Phonology .

Research questions and some of the methods addressed in the publications also extend naturally to the parallel investigation of manual signs as the encoding elements of sign languages . # Proceedings # *Papers in Laboratory Phonology Volume I : Between the Grammar and Physics of Speech *Papers in Laboratory Phonology Volume II : Gesture , Segment , Prosody *Papers in Laboratory Phonology Volume III : Phonological Structure and Phonetic Form *Papers in Laboratory Phonology Volume IV : Phonology and Phonetic Evidence *Papers in Laboratory Phonology Volume V : Acquisition and the Lexicon *Papers in Laboratory Phonology Volume VI : Phonetic Interpretation *Laboratory Phonology 7 *Laboratory Phonology 8 *Laboratory Phonology 9 *Laboratory Phonology 10 # Executive Council # *D .

Following a highly publicised appeal for information on her whereabouts and intensive police enquiries , her body was discovered on 25 December 2010 in Failand , North Somerset . A post-mortem examination determined that she had been strangled . The murder inquiry , named Operation Braid , was one of the largest police investigations ever undertaken in the Bristol area . The case dominated news coverage in the United Kingdom around the Christmas period as Yeates ' family sought assistance from the public through social networking services and press conferences . Rewards amounting to 60,000 were offered for information leading to those responsible for Yeates ' death .

After two days of questioning , he was charged on 22 January 2011 with Yeates ' murder . On 5 May 2011 , Tabak pleaded guilty to Yeates ' manslaughter , but denied murdering her . His trial started on 4 October 2011 ; he was found guilty of murder on 28 October 2011 , and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 20 years . The nature of press reporting on aspects of the case led to the instigation of legal proceedings against a number of UK newspapers . Libel action was brought by Jefferies against eight publications over their coverage of his arrest , resulting in the payment to him of substantial damages . The ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' and ' ' The Sun ' ' were found guilty of contempt of court for reporting information that could prejudice a trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish church in the Bristol suburb where she lived ; her funeral took place near the family home in Hampshire . Several memorials were planned , including one in a garden she had been designing for a new hospital in Bristol . # Background and disappearance # Joanna Clare Yeates was born on 19 April 1985 to David and Teresa Yeates in Hampshire , England . She was privately educated at Embley Park near Romsey . Yeates studied for her A-levels at Peter Symonds College and graduated with a degree in landscape architecture from Writtle College . She received her Postgraduate diploma in landscape architecture from the University of Gloucestershire . In December 2008 , Yeates met then-25-year-old fellow landscape architect Greg Reardon at the firm Hyland Edgar Driver in Winchester . The couple moved in together in 2009 and settled in Clifton , Bristol , when the company relocated to that area . Yeates later changed jobs to work at the Building Design Partnership in Bristol . At approximately 8:00 pm on 19 December 2010 , Reardon returned home from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trying to contact her by phone and text , but did not find it .. completely out of character .. that she did not respond . While awaiting Yeates ' return , Reardon found that her purse and keys were at the flat , and that their cat appeared to have been neglected . After he called her again , her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat , which was still in the flat . Around midnight , Reardon contacted the police and then Yeates ' parents to report her missing . Investigators subsequently pieced together the sequence of events leading up to her disappearance . They determined Yeates had spent the evening of 17 December 2010 with colleagues at the Bristol Ram pub on Park Street , leaving at around 8:00 pm to begin the 20-minute walk home . She told friends and colleagues that she was looking forward to spending the weekend alone ; she planned to spend her time baking and shopping for Christmas . Yeates was seen on closed-circuit television ( CCTV ) at around 8:10 pm leaving a Waitrose supermarket without purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at 8:30 pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve . The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of Tesco Express at around 8:40 pm . She had also bought two small bottles of cider at a nearby off-license , Bargain Booze . # Search , public appeal , and discovery of body # Reardon and Yeates ' friends set up a website and used social networking services to help look for her . On 21 December 2010 , Yeates ' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference . In another press conference , broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by Sky News and BBC News , Yeates ' father David commented on her disappearance : I think she was abducted after getting home to her flat .. I have no idea of the circumstances of the abduction because of what was left behind .. I feel sure she would not have gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere . Her keys , phone , purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrieved a receipt for a pizza , but found no sign of it or of its packaging . Both bottles of cider were found in the flat , one of them partially consumed . As there was no evidence of forced entry or a struggle , investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor . On 25 December 2010 , a fully clothed body was found in the snow by a couple walking their dogs along Longwood Lane near a golf course and next to the entrance of a quarry in Failand , approximately from her home . The body was identified by police as that of Yeates . Reardon and the Yeates family visited the site of the discovery on 27 December 2010 . David Yeates said that the family had been told to prepare for the worst and expressed relief that his daughter 's body had been recovered . Funeral arrangements were delayed as investigators wished to retain the body for a while . The pathologist Dr Nat Carey consented to the release of the body on 31 January 2011. # Investigation # The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian staff under the direction of Detective Chief Inspector Phil Jones , a senior officer with Avon and Somerset Constabulary 's major crime investigation unit . It became one of the largest police operations in the Constabulary 's history . Jones urged the public to come forward with any information to help catch the killer , especially potential witnesses who were in the vicinity of Longwood Lane in Failand in the period before Yeates ' body was discovered . He stated that the investigation was seeking the driver of a light-coloured 4x4 vehicle for questioning . Jones said that officers had been .. inundated with thousands of calls .. and were .. exhausting every lead and avenue that they were provided with . Police examined over 100 hours of surveillance footage along with 293 t of rubbish seized from the area around Yeates ' flat . Crime Stoppers offered a 10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of her murderer , while ' ' The Sun ' ' newspaper offered 50,000 . Authorities advised people living in the area to secure their homes , and warned women not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the murder investigation Yeates ' father said , I fear that whoever has done this will never hand themselves in , but we live in hope that the police will catch who is responsible . # Post-mortem and initial enquiries # Following the discovery of Yeates ' body , detectives from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary issued an appeal for anyone with information about the death to come forward , and investigated similarities with other unsolved cases . Of particular interest to them were those of 20-year-old Glenis Carruthers who was strangled in 1974 , Melanie Hall , aged 25 , who disappeared in 1996 and whose body was discovered thirteen years later , and 35-year-old Claudia Lawrence who went missing in 2009 . Investigators identified striking similarities between the Yeates and Hall cases , notably their age and appearance , and that they had disappeared after returning home from meeting friends , but the possibility of such connections was later downplayed by authorities . The police gathered surveillance video from Clifton Suspension Bridge , which forms part of the most direct route from the crime scene to the Clifton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of poor quality , making it impossible to clearly distinguish individuals or car registration numbers . Investigators were aware that the perpetrator could have used an alternative bridge across the River Avon less than a mile to the south to avoid CCTV coverage . A post-mortem examination began on 26 December 2010 , though results were delayed due to the frozen condition of the body . Police initially thought it possible that Yeates froze to death because her body showed no visible signs of injury . Investigators announced on 28 December 2010 that the case had become a murder inquiry as the coroner determined that Yeates had died as a result of strangulation . The post-mortem indicated that she had died .. several days before being discovered on 25 December 2010 . The examination also confirmed that Yeates did not eat the pizza she had purchased . Detective Chief Inspector Jones stated that the investigation found .. no evidence to suggest that Joanna was sexually assaulted . The police searched Reardon 's laptop computer and mobile phone as part of standard procedure . Reardon was ruled out as a suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party at a neighbouring house on Canynge Road on the night of Yeates ' disappearance recalled hearing two loud screams shortly after 9:00 pm coming from the direction of Yeates ' flat . Another neighbour who lived behind Yeates ' home said that he heard a high-pitched woman 's voice scream Help me . Officers removed the front door to Yeates ' flat to check for clothing fibres and DNA evidence , with investigators examining the possibility that the perpetrator had entered the flat before Yeates returned home . # Further enquiries # Senior officers from the investigation asked for assistance from the National Policing Improvement Agency , which provides expertise for difficult cases . On 4 January 2011 , a clinical forensic psychologist , who had previously been involved as a criminal profiler in other high profile murder cases , joined the investigation to help narrow down the number of potential suspects . Jones stated that his officers had established over 1,000 lines of inquiry .

On 9 January 2011 , Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy gave her support to the idea of a public DNA screening process if the police found it useful . The Avon and Somerset Constabulary had conducted mass DNA screening during the 1995 investigation into the disappearance of then-18-year-old Louise Smith . McCarthy suggested that the screening process should be extended beyond Clifton to the wider Bristol area . DNA that had been found on Yeates ' body was tested for a potential profile .

He was taken to a local police station for questioning while forensic investigators inspected his flat . On 31 December , a senior police officer granted investigators a 12-hour extension to the arrest , enabling them to hold him in custody for additional questioning . Police subsequently applied to magistrates for further extensions which were granted on 31 December and 1 January . Investigators were able to detain him as a suspect for up to 96 hours , but released Jefferies on bail after two days . He retained the legal services of the law firm Stokoe Partnership to act on his behalf . On 4 March 2011 , police released him from bail and stated he was no longer a suspect . He subsequently won an undisclosed sum in libel damages for defamatory news articles published following his arrest , and received an apology from Avon and Somerset Police for any distress caused to him during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case was filmed on location in Bristol for broadcast in the 26 January edition of the BBC television programme ' ' Crimewatch ' ' . A firm that had been involved in the production of the ' ' Harry Potter ' ' films was contracted to reproduce the snowy conditions at the time of Yeates ' disappearance . The reconstruction of Yeates ' last movements was filmed on 18 January , and within 24 hours of news coverage about the production , over 300 people contacted the police . A breakthrough led investigators to believe that Yeates ' body may have been transported in a large holdall or suitcase . On the morning of 20 January , the Avon and Somerset Constabulary arrested 32-year-old Dutch engineer Vincent Tabak , who lived with his girlfriend in the flat next door to Yeates . However , authorities declined to reveal additional details while the suspect was being interrogated due to concerns over controversial media coverage of Jefferies ' arrest , which had breached the rules governing what can be reported when an individual is arrested . The Tabak arrest followed an anonymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal by Yeates ' parents on ' ' Crimewatch ' ' . Canynge Road was closed by police while scaffolding was constructed around Yeates ' home ; and officers sealed off Tabak 's adjacent flat . Investigators also searched the nearby townhouse of a friend , where Tabak was believed to have been staying , about a mile away . Tabak had previously been ruled out as a suspect during an earlier stage of the investigation , and had returned to England from a holiday visit to his family in the Netherlands . Following Tabak 's arrest , the BBC cancelled its plans to air the Yeates re-enactment on ' ' Crimewatch ' ' . On 31 January , previously unseen photos of Yeates were released through the programme 's website. # DNA tests # DNA tests were carried out by LGC Forensics , a private company which undertakes forensic analysis for criminal investigations .

But we could say that the probability of it not being a match with Tabak was less than one in a billion . # Legal proceedings and perpetrator # # Murder charge and plea # After questioning during 96 hours of detention , Tabak was charged on 22 January 2011 with the murder of Joanna Yeates . He made a brief appearance at Bristol 's Magistrates ' Court on 24 January and was remanded in custody . Tabak , legally represented by Paul Cook , declined to request bail during a hearing the following day . Tabak was moved from Bristol Prison because of fears for his safety , and was placed under suicide watch at Long Lartin Prison near Evesham .

On 5 May 2011 , Vincent Tabak pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Yeates , but denied murdering her . His plea of guilty to manslaughter was rejected by the Crown Prosecution Service . On 20 September , Tabak appeared in person at a pre-trial hearing at Bristol Crown Court . Appearances at previous hearings had been made via videolink from prison . # Vincent Tabak # Vincent Tabak ( born 10 February 1978 ) was a Dutch engineer who had lived and worked in the United Kingdom since 2007 . The son of Gerald and Sonja Tabak , and the youngest of five siblings , he was raised in Uden , 21 miles ( 34 km ) north of Eindhoven . Tabak 's childhood next-door neighbour , John Massoeurs , described him after the trial as an intelligent introverted loner . Tabak studied at Eindhoven University of Technology beginning in 1996 , graduating with an MSc in architecture , building and planning in 2003 , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how people use space in office buildings and public areas . The paper was published in 2008 . Leaving university in 2007 , he moved to the United Kingdom after taking a job at the headquarters of Buro Happold , an engineering consultancy firm in Bath , and settled in a flat in the town . He worked as a people flow analyst , a role which required him to examine how people move around public spaces such as schools , airports and sports stadiums . While living in Bath he established a relationship with a woman he first met through ' ' The Guardian ' ' s online dating website ' ' Soulmates ' ' . She was later described by the newspaper as his first serious girlfriend ; he paid tribute to her in the acknowledgements of his thesis : I am very happy she entered my life . The couple moved to a flat in Canynge Road , Bristol , in June 2009 . Though Joanna Yeates and her partner moved into the neighbouring flat in Canynge Road in the autumn of 2010 , she and Tabak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months leading up to Yeates ' death , Tabak had used his computer to research escort agencies during business trips in the United Kingdom and United States , and contacted several prostitutes by phone . He also viewed violent internet pornography that depicted women being controlled by men , showing images of them being bound and gagged , held by the neck and choked . During the murder investigation , police found images of a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Yeates . In one scene she was shown pulling up a pink top to expose her bra and breasts . When Yeates was discovered , she was wearing a similarly arranged pink top . At Tabak 's trial , prosecuting barrister Nigel Lickley QC , argued that the evidence of Tabak 's activities should be provided to the jury : It might shed light on the need to hold a woman for long enough and the need to squeeze hard enough to take her life . Details of Tabak 's viewing of pornography were not included in the prosecution 's case since the judge believed it did not prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was disclosed that images of child pornography had been found on Tabak 's laptop . In December 2013 , the Crown Prosecution Service announced that he would be prosecuted for possessing the material . # Trial # The trial of Vincent Tabak started on 4 October 2011 at the Crown Court at Bristol before Mr Justice Field and a jury . His counsel in the trial was William Clegg QC and the prosecutor was Nigel Lickley QC . Tabak pleaded guilty to manslaughter , but denied murder . The prosecution case was that Tabak had strangled Yeates at her flat within minutes of her arrival home on 17 December 2010 , using sufficient force to kill her . The prosecutors stated that Tabak around taller than Yeates had used his height and build to overpower her , pinning her to the floor by the wrists , and that she had suffered 43 separate injuries to her head , neck , torso and arms during the struggle . The injuries included cuts , bruises , and a fractured nose . Lickley told the court that the struggle was lengthy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did not offer an explanation for the reasoning behind Tabak 's initial attack on Yeates . Evidence was presented that Tabak had then tried to conceal the crime by disposing of her body . The court heard that DNA swabs taken from Yeates ' body had provided a match with Tabak . Samples found behind the knees of her jeans indicated she may have been held by the legs as she was carried , while fibres suggested contact with Tabak 's coat and car . Blood stains were found on a wall overlooking a quarry close to where Yeates was discovered . The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Christopher Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation , and that in the days following Yeates ' death , he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area . In his defence , Tabak claimed that the killing had not been sexually motivated , and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He claimed that Yeates had made a flirty comment and invited him to drink with her . He said that after she screamed he held his hands over her mouth and around her neck to silence her . He denied suggestions of a struggle , claiming to have held Yeates by the neck with only minimal force , and .. for about 20 seconds . He told the court that after dumping the body he was .. in a state of panic . The jury was sent out to deliberate on 26 October , and returned with a verdict two days later . On 28 October 2011 , Tabak was found guilty of Joanna Yeates ' murder by a 10 to 2 majority verdict . He was jailed for life , with a minimum term of 20 years . Passing sentence , Mr Justice Field referred to a sexual element to the killing . # Media controversy # The manner in which certain aspects of the case were reported by the British media led to one television broadcaster being temporarily banned from attending press conferences , and the instigation of legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Attorney General . Following a television news report on 4 January 2011 that criticised the handling of the investigation , ITN reporters were banned by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary from attending a press conference convened to give updates on the murder case . The item , presented by journalist Geraint Vincent , claimed police had made little progress with their investigation , and questioned whether they were following correct procedural methods . A former murder squad detective told the report that certain routine inquiries such as looking for fresh evidence at the crime scene were not being carried out . ITN accused the police of attempting .. to censor what information we can broadcast .. while the constabulary filed a complaint with the Office of Communications , calling the broadcast .. unfair , nave and irresponsible reporting . The police subsequently lifted the sanctions against ITN , but said that they would .. not hesitate to adopt similar tactics in the future . Legal action was also considered over a tweet revealing that Tabak had viewed internet pornography showing erotic asphyxiation and bondage . The contempt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Writing in London 's ' ' Evening Standard ' ' on 5 January 2011 , media commentator Roy Greenslade expressed concern over a number of negative articles that had appeared in newspapers concerning Yeates ' landlord , Christopher Jefferies , following his arrest , describing the coverage as .. character assassination on a large scale . He cited several examples of headlines and stories that had been published , including a headline in ' ' The Sun ' ' describing Jefferies a former teacher at Clifton College as weird , posh , lewd and creepy ; a story from the ' ' Daily Express ' ' quoting unnamed former pupils referring to him as .. a sort of Nutty Professor who made them feel creeped out by his strange behaviour ; and an article from the ' ' Daily Telegraph ' ' , which reported Jefferies .. has been described by pupils at Clifton College .. as a fan of dark and violent avant-garde films . Jefferies launched legal action against six newspapers on 21 April ' ' The Sun ' ' , the ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Daily Express ' ' , the ' ' Daily Mail ' ' and the ' ' Daily Record ' ' seeking damages for libel . He was represented by Louis Charalambous of the law firm Simons Muirhead and Burton , who in 2008 had successfully acted for Robert Murat after he became a suspect during the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann and had faced similar media scrutiny . On 29 July Jefferies accepted substantial damages for defamation from ' ' The Sun ' ' , the ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' , the ' ' Sunday Mirror ' ' , the ' ' Daily Record ' ' , the ' ' Daily Mail ' ' , the ' ' Daily Express ' ' , the ' ' Daily Star ' ' and ' ' The Scotsman ' ' in connection with their coverage of his arrest . In an interview following Tabak 's conviction , Jefferies commented : It has taken up a whole year virtually of my life , that period of time has meant that everything else that I would normally be doing has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change the law on legal aid , which he said would prevent people with limited means from taking action against newspapers . Dominic Grieve , the Attorney General for England and Wales , stated on 31 December 2010 that he was considering action under the Contempt of Court Act 1981 to enforce the obligation of the media not to prejudice a possible future trial . Criminology professor David Wilson commented on the resonance of the murder case with the national news media : The British public loves a whodunnit .. It 's a particularly British thing . We were the first nation to use murder stories to sell newspapers and that culture is more ingrained here than elsewhere . Wilson called Yeates , a white female professional , an ideal victim for the media . On 1 January , Yeates ' boyfriend Greg Reardon commented on the media coverage surrounding the arrest of Christopher Jefferies : Jo 's life was cut short tragically but the finger-pointing and character assassination by social and news media of as yet innocent men has been shameful . On 12 May 2011 , the Administrative Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committal for contempt of court against ' ' The Sun ' ' and the ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' for the way they had reported the arrest of Jefferies . On 29 July , the court ( Lord Judge CJ , Thomas LJ &amp; Owen J ) ruled that both newspapers had been in contempt of court , and fined the ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' 50,000 and ' ' The Sun ' ' 18,000 . The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales , Lord Judge , stated that .. in our judgment , as a matter of principle , the vilification of a suspect under arrest is a potential impediment to the course of justice . The publishers of ' ' The Sun ' ' and the ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' subsequently appealed their fines , but the ' ' Mirror ' ' case was rejected by the Supreme Court of England and Wales on 9 March 2012 , whilst ' ' The Sun ' ' withdrew its appeal . # Ramifications # The Yeates case was mentioned during a Parliamentary debate on a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any journalist who names an uncharged suspect . The proposed legislation was introduced into the House of Commons in June 2010 , by Anna Soubry , the Conservative MP for Broxtowe , a former journalist and criminal law barrister . In a debate on 4 February 2011 Soubry told the House : What we saw in Bristol was , in effect , a feeding frenzy and vilification . Much of the coverage was not only completely irrelevant , but there was a homophobic tone to it which I found deeply offensive . The slurs on the man were out of order . However , she withdrew the proposal after encountering opposition from the Conservative-led coalition government . Jefferies gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry , established by Prime Minister David Cameron to investigate the ethics and behaviour of the British media following the ' ' News of the World ' ' phone hacking affair . Jefferies told the inquiry that reporters had besieged him after he was questioned by the police ; he said : It was clear that the tabloid press had decided that I was guilty of Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my guilt . They embarked on a frenzied campaign to blacken my character by publishing a series of very serious allegations about me which were completely untrue . Appearing before the same inquiry on 16 January 2012 , the ' ' Daily Mirror ' ' editor , Richard Wallace , described the newspaper 's coverage of Jefferies ' arrest as a black mark on his editing record . # Aftermath and memorials # Associate vicar Dan Clark led a memorial service for Yeates at Christ Church in Clifton on 2 January 2011 .

4 The Triumph Super 9 was first introduced by the Triumph Motor Company in 1931 at a price of 185 . It continued through into 1933 . It had an RAC rating of 8.9 hp . The Super 9s were the first Triumphs to use 12-volt electrics ( early Southern Crosss still used 6-volt for a short period ) and the first to be fitted with a Coventry Climax engine , which was made under licence by Triumph . Two 6-volt batteries were housed under the rear passenger floor , while the prototype had a single 12-volt battery on the bulk head . Many of the chassis and transmission components were left overs from the Super 7s and 8s. # Engine # The Coventry Climax engines are of the IOE configuration , with a bore of 60 mm and a stroke of 90 mm , giving 1018 cc . Generally a Solex side-draught carburettor was fitted . During 1931 the rear of the engine was supported on a 3/16-inch steel plate spanning across the chassis , consequently the gearbox bell housing was deep and with the starter alongside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallower bell housing , the starter was then repositioned alongside the engine . This arrangement was used on later Super 9s &amp; 10s and on Glorias . The cooling waster is circulated by thermal syphon aided by the sloping shape of the aluminium water manifold on the head . The dynamo is driven by a Duplex chain with the distributor mounted at the rear end of the dynamo . A top speed of 60 mph was obtainable with a cruising speed of 45 mph . Petrol consumption in the region of 35 mpg for a car weighing 19 cwt. unladen. # Steering # Steering is by worm and wheel , the drop shaft attached to the wheel is on three keyways so it can be turned through 120 deg. to compensate for wear . Also adjustment is provided for engagement of the worm to the wheel . # Transmission and suspension # Transmission is through a single -inch clutch plate along with a 4-speed-and-reverse gear box . The hand brake operated a transmission brake attached to the rear end of the gear box . A conventional Hardy-Spicer prop shaft connected it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wheel with under slung worm making for a low floor . The brakes are Lockheed hydraulic acting on -inch drums with one leading and one trailing shoe on all 4 wheels . The petrol tank is at the rear , unlike Super 7s which had a gravity tank . Fuel was pumped either by Autovac or SU Petrolift . Suspension consists of 4 semi elliptic springs on rubber bushes damped by Luvax hydraulic shock absorbers . Cars after 1931 replaced the rubber bushes with bronze bushes and grease nipples . Wheels were of the Magnum type with 5 studs fitted with 4.5019-inch pneumatic tyres . The car had a track of 3 ft in and a wheelbase of 7 ft 8 in. # Bodies # There were three significant models on the same chassis , a 4-door six-light saloon , a 4-door tourer and a 2-door 4-seat tourer known as the Southern Cross . The front doors on the saloon were hinged at the front , while those at the back were hinged to the rear . A sliding sun roof was standard , operated by a rotating handle above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not appear on the prototype . The most noticeable differences between 1931 cars and the later models was a change to the radiator surround and different profiling of the front wings . # Accessories # Optional extras were a luggage rack , chrome bumpers and Stevenson Jacking system . The upholstery was leather cloth with leather seating . The only known Super 9 to have Bedford Cord throughout is the prototype ; this also has a smokers vent in the roof which is shown on brochures , but is not seen on any production 9s . Instruments consisted of a speedometer , clock , oil gauge and ammeter . After 1931 a petrol gauge was added , prior to this a fuel tap was incorporated to give a reserve supply . Dash switches consisted of , a dash light , interior light , ignition , and a starter button , also choke and fast running control . External lights switching , battery charge rate , and ignition timing were all at the centre of the steering wheel . # References #

4 type = Drained freshwater loch location = Kilmaurs and Stewarton , East Ayrshire , Scotland depth = volume = islands = One Crannog Buiston Loch ( NS 416 433 ) ( locally pronounced ) , also known as Buston , Biston , and Mid Buiston was situated in the mid-Ayrshire clayland at an altitude of 90 m OD . It is visible as an often flooded surface depression in pastureland situated in a low lying area close to the A735 road between the farms and dwellings of Lochside , Buistonend and Mid-Buiston in the Parishes of Kilmaurs and Stewarton , East Ayrshire , Scotland . The loch was natural , sitting in a hollow created by glaciation . The loch waters drained via the Garrier Burn that joins the Bracken and Lochridge Burns before joining the River Irvine . It is well documented through the presence of a crannog first excavated 1880-1 and then documented by Mr. D. McNaught , Dr R. Munro and others . # History # Blaeu 's map of 1654 , based on Timothy Pont 's work of the late 16th century , shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however by the mid-eighteenth century the loch appears to have been drained . The Garrier Burn is marked on Thomson 's map of 1828 , however it has been canalised and field drains added by the time of the first Ordnance Survey of the mid 19th century , presumably as part of an improved drainage system . Around 1830 the loch was described by a Mr Hay as being a mossy bog in the summer and a sheet of water throughout the winter and by 1880 a ' ' richly cultivated meadow ' ' . Buiston was a post-glacial loch , on the lands of the farm known as Mid-Buiston , for many years the property of the Earls of Eglinton , and was at first believed to be a structure built by the Earls of Eglinton to house a shelter for shooting waterfowl . Evidence of the original shoreline persists on the northern side of the loch basin . The early Ordnance Survey maps and written descriptions show the site as fully drained and under cultivation , however drainage is now inadequate ( 2011 ) and the area is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The loch 's drainage may have begun in the early 18th century when Alexander Montgomerie , 10th Earl of Eglinton , was pursuing a number of agricultural improvements on his extensive estates . Further drainage work may have taken place in the 1740s as part of the improvements undertaken to provide employment for Montgomerie Irish estate workers during the Irish potato famines of the 1740s and the mid 19th centuries . Many drainage schemes also date to the end of WWI when many soldiers returned en masse to civilian life . # The Crannog # The roughly circular crannog , known as the ' Swan Knowe ' , lay around 70 m from the northern shore and was identified in December 1880 from ' worked ' timbers located within the drainage ' gote ' or ditch on the site by a teacher from Kilmaurs , Duncan McNaught , who was familiar with the Lochlea crannog site . The site was first excavated in 1880 and more thoroughly in April 1881 . In 1989-90 the site was re-excavated as part of an investigation into the condition of crannogs in south-west Scotland commissioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decay on crannog sites . Finds included a rare fourth century hanging bowl , a dugout canoe , and two ovens . The crannog had four periods of occupation , dating from AD1 to AD 525 , that is from before the Roman conquest of this area , through the period of the Damnonian tribe 's rule , and into the time of the brythonic Kingdom of Strathclyde . Three log boats or canoes seem to have been found , the one in 1989-90 was left on site , another was lost in a fire at the Dick Institute in 1909 and the third may survive in the Hunterian Museum in the form of an unprovenanced specimen from the 1881 dig . <gallery> File:Loch Tay Crannog.jpgA reconstruction of a crannog in Loch Tay File:Buiston Loch canoe 1881. jpgA Buiston Loch canoe File:Buiston Crannog plan.jpgPlan of Buiston Loch File:Buiston Crannog excavations 1881. jpgView of the crannog excavations </gallery> Much timber ( thirteen cartloads ) had been taken away prior to the crannog 's identification and a local farmer is recorded as having remarked ' ' There maun hae been dwallers here at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of turves , stones , intermingled within branches and tree trunks .

4 birthplace = Buffalo , New York deathplace = Suffolk , New York Peter Grippe ( August 11 , 1912 October 18 , 2002 ) was an American sculptor , printmaker , and painter . As a sculptor , he worked in bronze , terracotta , wire , plaster , and found objects . His Monument to Hiroshima series ( 1963 ) used found objects cast in bronze sculptures to evoke the chaotic humanity of the Japanese city after its incineration by atomic bomb . Other Grippe Surrealist sculptural works address less warlike themes , including that of city life . However , his expertise extended beyond sculpture to ink drawings , watercolor painting , and printmaking ( intaglio ) . He joined and later directed Atelier 17 , the intaglio studio founded in London and moved to New York at the beginning of World War II by its founder , Stanley William Hayter . Today , Grippe 's ' ' 21 Etchings and Poems ' ' , a part of the permanent collection at the Davis Museum and Cultural Center at Wellesley College in Wellesley , Massachusetts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # Biography # Grippe , a member of the American Abstract Artists group , was born on August 11 , 1912 , in Buffalo , New York , and died on October 18 , 2002 , in Suffolk , New York . While primarily known as a sculptor working in bronze and clay , he created a portfolio of etchings by 21 artists ( examples include Willem de Kooning , Jacques Lipchitz , and Peter Grippe himself ) and 21 poets ( including Frank O'Hara , Dylan Thomas , and Thomas Merton ) in a work entitled ' ' 21 Etchings and Poems ' ' . The collective work took three years to print and was published by New York 's Morris Gallery in 1960 . Grippe was educated at the Albright-Knox Art School ( today the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy ) and the Art Institute of Buffalo . He moved to New York in the 1930s , and his work reflects a move into the Cubist and Surrealist schools . According to Bob Mattison , Marshall R. Metzgar Professor of Art History at Lafayette College , Easton , Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Grippe and his colleagues embraced Cubism with its openwork multidimensional view of the world and Surrealist imagery drawn from the subconscious thus bringing American sculpture into the modern era . As Grippe 's artistic and academic career progressed , he taught at several higher education institutions , including Brandeis University , where he was named the first professor of sculpture . He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in the category of fine arts in 1964 . A transcribed interview with Grippe is available at the Smithsonian Institution 's Archives of American Art . The interviewer , Dorothy Seckler , spoke with him in 1968 . Grippe is also mentioned in a transcribed Smithsonian Institution interview in 2002 with Ruth Asawa in her San Francisco in which she discusses his technique and their associates during the period from 1946 to 1949 .

3514 The Silesian Eagle ( German language : ' ' Schlesischer Adler ' ' ) was a medal awarded for fighting the Silesian Uprisings as part of the Freikorps Oberland under the Weimar Republic . Instituted on the 19 of June 1919 by VI . Armee-Korps Generalleutnant Friedrich von Friedeburg , the Silesian Eagle declined itself in two classes , 2nd class for three months of service and 1st class for 6 months of service and could be adorned with oak leaves , swords , or both . This medal was one of the few Freikorps awards that were allowed to be worn on uniforms during the Third Reich after the 1935 ban on unofficial medals . However , the swords , and oak leaves , denoting additional bravery , merit or service were banned , but despite interdictions , many veterans continued wearing them in active military service with the Third Reich .

4 HomeVestors of America , Inc. is a privately owned U.S. real estate franchise company that sells franchises to investors who provide real estate services by buying homes in need of repair , renovating them and either selling or renting them . Founded in 1989 and franchising since 1996 , the company consists of 200 independently owned and operated franchisees located in 33 states . Acting on approximately 160,000 leads , franchisees buy an average of 8,000 homes within a year , holding them about six months on average . Headquartered in Dallas , Texas , HomeVestors is the largest homebuyer in the United States . HomeVestors has been ranked on Entrepreneur magazine 's Franchise 500 for five consecutive years ; ranked on Entrepreneur magazines Fastest-Growing Franchises list for four consecutive years ; and ranked on the SMU Cox School of Business Dallas 100 fastest-growing private companies based in Dallas for four consecutive years . Additionally , HomeVestors was named to the Franchise Business Review Top 50 Franchises for the fifth consecutive year in 2010. # Best Markets to Invest in Rental Property # HomeVestors maintains a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July 2011 to forecast the expected performance of rental real estate , particularly single-family homes . The intention is to allow real estate investors to accurately gauge local markets and how they relate to the national and international ones . # Mortgage Crisis # With the slowdown in housing sales , HomeVestors has helped the real estate market by buying homes from distressed owners who are facing foreclosures . According to The Economist , one in four American borrowers are under water . Over 4m households owe at least twice as much as their home is worth . The resulting foreclosures cause a lot of damage . When homes are foreclosed upon and sold by lenders , the discount rises to 35% , largely because the property is not being maintained . The steep drop in price harms other homeowners . The values of neighboring houses are pushed down , forcing other borrowers deeper under water . Additionally , some 5m homes have entered foreclosure in the past three years . Credit Suisse estimates that over 9m more will enter in the process in the next four years . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1m a year ) . With the recent mortgage crisis , a lot of homeowners have to get out of real estate quickly as prices and equity go down . Many of the sellers are looking for a quick sale . HomeVestors franchisees offer 55% to 65% of the estimated market value of the homes , minus the renovation costs . This service benefits people who lack the time or inclination to fix up and sell a home themselves as well as the surrounding homes and community . # History # HomeVestors was launched in the late 1980s when real estate agent Keneth DAngelo started flipping houses . By the mid-1990s DAngelo was recycling 150 houses a year in the Dallas area . He sold his first franchise in 1996 . After DAngelo died in 2004 , John P.

4 Tivoli Provisioning Manager ( TPM ) is a product in IBMs Tivoli Software brand . Its purpose is to automate the provisioning of virtual servers and software . TPM is a manager of managers , in that it does not manage any hardware itself , but issues commands to the hypervisors that do actually manage the hardware . TPM can orchestrate the various tasks , and provide a common interface for different platforms , notably Intel-based managed by VMware to host MS-Windows and Linux virtual servers ; and IBM 's own AIX servers running on pSeries. # History # TPM originated with Think Dynamics which IBM acquired in 2003 . Their Think Control product was good in provisioning and managing ( virtual ) servers in data centers . IBM added their OPAL Integrated Service Management Library , and marketed their new product as Tivoli Information Orchestrator - hence the appearance of the letters tio in many product files of TPM .

As of v7.1 , this is part of the Maximo database ( maxdb71 ) . # WorkFlows # All TPM 's actions are executed by WorkFlows . These are written in a proprietary interpreted procedural scripting language . Most information must be drawn through queries from the DCM . Most string manipulation must be done by Jython calls - because both the WorkFlow interpreter and Jython parse , interpret , and manipulate these strings , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ server systems are done through scriptlets , which generate ( shell ) scripts that are executed on the target servers . # Developing # For developing TPM workflows , one needs the so-called Automation Package Development Environment ( APDE ) : this is the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment with a special TPM plugin .

Saarbrcken is the capital of the federal German state of Saarland , which the club is named after . The club was formed in 1996 in a merger of the two local sides Saarbrcken Wlfe and Dillingen Steelhawks . As its greatest success , the team has won promotion to the German Football League twice , in 2000 and 2010 . In this league , it qualified for the play-offs once , in 2005 .

In 1989 , after the ' ' Wlfe ' ' had folded , the club was renamed Dillingen Steelhawks . Also in 1989 , the Saarbrcken Ghostbusters were formed as another American football club in the Saarland . The Dillingen Steelhawks continued competitive league football in the tier-three ' ' Verbandsliga ' ' , at times alongside the ' ' Ghostbusters ' ' . The team remained at local level until 1993 , when it won promotion to the central division of the ' ' 2nd Bundesliga ' ' . At this level , it lasted for only one season , but bounced back in 1995 and returned to the second level for 1996 . The Saarbrcken Ghostbusters were renamed Saarbrcken Wlfe in 1991 but were unable to rise above the third tier of the league system . By the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to the conclusion that , as individual clubs , no further improvement was possible and agreed on a merger . # Saarland Hurricanes # The team , now as the Saarland Hurricanes and still playing in the ' ' 2nd Bundesliga ' ' , had some instant success , winning its division in 1997 and 2000 . In 1997 , the Stuttgart Scorpions proved too strong , winning both promotion/relegation matches and barring the ' ' Hurricanes ' ' from the elite league . In its second attempt , in 2000 , the side overcame the Landsberg Express in the first game of the promotion round 40-22 . Landsberg did not field in the second game and the ' ' Hurricanes ' ' were qualified for the German Football League for the 2001 season . The Saarland Hurricanes were not a strong side in their following time in the GFL , only winning a game each in three of their first four seasons . However , they still managed to finish fifth and away from the relegation rank . The 2005 season was to be the club 's best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the post season for the first time . It then lost to the Braunschweig Lions 17-32 in the quarter finals and was eliminated . After this one-off success , the club quickly declined again and finished last in its division in 2007 . Having to enter the relegation round , the team lost both games to the Munich Cowboys and found itself back in the ' ' 2nd Bundesliga ' ' . In this league , soon to be renamed German Football League 2 , the Saarland Hurricanes took two seasons to rebuilt before another division title in 2010 meant direct promotion back to the GFL , courtesy to a league expansion . The club was only able to win two of their regular season games in 2011 and finished second-last in the GFL South , avoiding relegation because of an even worse performance by the Plattling Black Hawks . In 2012 the club came seventh in the southern division of the GFL and thereby failed to qualify for the play-off .

4 Label = Epic 05698 The One I Loved Back Then ( The Corvette Song ) is a country song written by Gary Gentry and recorded by American country music singer George Jones . It was recorded for his 1985 album ' ' Who 's Gon na Fill Their Shoes ' ' , from which it was released in late 1985 as the second single . The song peaked at number three on the Hot Country Singles chart in early 1986. # The Song 's Story # The song focuses on man 's fascination with fast cars and beautiful women , and certain similarities between the two . In the song , the singer and his girlfriend are out for a leisure drive ( in the singer 's Corvette ) when the singer stops at a convenience store to purchase beer and cigarettes . As the singer pays for his merchandise , the store clerk , supposedly noticing the singer 's Corvette parked outside , tells the singer how he had one just like her a long time ago ( in 1963 , mistaken for the year of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man down at the bank ( supposedly , a loan officer ) . Thinking the clerk is talking about his car , the singer offers him his keys and asks the clerk to take her for a spin .

The aforementioned similarities between car and girl are revealed in the song 's chorus : hotter than a two-dollar pistol , the fastest thing around , long and lean , every young man 's dream , turned every head in town , built and fun to handle . # Chart performance # class= wikitable sortable ! align= left Chart ( 19851986 ) ! align= center Peak **6;25030;br position 
4 Maria del Carmen Perez Jimenez Barradas ( 18 March 1888 12 May 1963 ) was a Uruguayan pianist , composer , and choral teacher . # Life # Maria del Carmen Prez Jimnez was born in Montevideo , the daughter of Spanish residents Santos Rojas and still life painter Antonio Prez Gimnez Barradas . She first studied with Antonio Frank , but ended the study after her father died in 1898 . With support from friends and family , she later continued with Aurora Pablo and M. Lopes Vicente at the Conservatorio del Uruguay , receiving her diploma in 1915 . Following the example of her younger brother , the painter Rafael Barradas , she adopted the stage name Carmen Barradas . Her youngest brother was writer and poet Antonio De Ignacios . After World War I , Rafael Barradas found he was unable to return from Spain to Uruguay , so in 1916 Barradas ' family moved to Spain . The family struggled to get there , having to apply for entry as laborers . Once in Spain , Carmen and her mother supported themselves by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and actively participated in the artistic life of Barcelona . In 1917 she gave a concert of her own works . Barradas lived and composed in Spain until 1922 , then returned with her family to Montevideo in 1928 , where she took a position teaching at the Institutos Normales . During this period , she published a magazine for children called ' ' Andresillo ' ' which included cartoons and songs . Her works pioneered the use of non-traditional graphic notation and experimental techniques . Barradas produced her own works at the Teatro Sols in 1934 and ended her composing career in 1949 . She died in Montevideo . Although her works were described as brilliant , her experimental direction was not well received in Uruguay during her lifetime . Many of her works were lost at her death .

4 related = Audi 80/4000 Audi Quattro The Audi Coup ( B2 , ' ' Typ ' ' 81/85 ) is a two-door coup produced and sold by Audi from 1980 to 1988 . The car was an attempt by Audi to offer a cheaper version of its turbocharged , permanent four-wheel drive Audi Quattro - without turbochargers or four wheel drive . Later , quattro was added as an option ( ' ' Typ ' ' 85 ) . ' ' Typ ' ' 81 was the internal model code for front-wheel drive Audi Coups . # History # The Coup , first displayed at the Paris Salon 1980 , featured a similar body shape to the Quattro , but without the knife-edged fender flares of the more expensive car . Mechanically , the biggest changes from the Quattro to the Coup were the use of a naturally aspirated 1.9 litre carburettor petrol engine , 2.0 litre , 2.1 , 2.2 , or 2.3 litre fuel injected inline five cylinder engine and a front-wheel drive drivetrain . Some lesser Coups were also fitted with a 1.8 litre inline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very first year of production a 1.6-litre YN 75PSkW 0 engine was available . The short-lived 1.6 was the only Coup not to be fitted with a black rear spoiler . The Coup was available as just plain Coup or GL ( four-cylinders only ) , Coup GT , and Coup quattro ( without the GT tag ) . From 1986 until the end of production in late 1988 , the Coup GT was also available with the 110-112PSkW 0 1.8-litre ' ' PV/DZ ' ' inline-four best known from the Golf GTi . For the last model year , the new 2,309 cc NG five cylinder was available , offering 136PSkW 0 at 5,600 rpm . This engine became available during 1987 for the last of the Audi Coups sold in the US , where it produced 130hpkW 0 at 5,700 rpm as opposed to the 110hpkW 0 at 5,500 rpm available from the 2.2-litre five which had been used since the facelift for model year 1985 . The Coup had originally gone on sale in the US late in model year 1981 with the 100hpkW 0 2,144 cc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # Facelift # The updated Coup , introduced after the German industrial holidays in the autumn of 1984 , was given new , slightly sloped radiator grille and headlights , a large wrap-around bumper with integrated spotlights and turn signals , plastic sill covers , and the large rear spoiler from the Audi Quattro . These changes brought the drag coefficient down to 0.36 . A new dashboard was also introduced , as was a new interior . GL and standard versions were cancelled for model year 1987 and all FWD Coups were from then referred to as Coup GT . For the 1986 model year , the Coups ( as with all Audis ) were available with more catalyzed engine options . Also , the entire B2 range ( Audi 80/90/Coup ) received stainless steel exhausts ( for European markets at least ) . # Coup quattro # Also in September 1984 , Audi made available the option of the quattro permanent four-wheel drive system to produce the Audi Coup quattro , a model which was rarer than the turbocharged Quattro model . While most common with the 2.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced 1987 for the US ) , in some markets the 1.8 litre four-cylinder models ( 90 and 112 PS ' ' DS/NE/JN ' ' or ' ' DZ ' ' engines ) were also available with four-wheel drive . The Coup and Coup quattro models appear almost identical from the outside except for a few minor quattro specifics . While the GT had COUPE GT on the rear side windows , the CQ had the quattro decal as used on the Ur-Quattro . Similarly at the rear , the badging was GT and quattro respectively . The quattro versions also used the Ur-Quattro rear windscreen with quattro written into the heater elements ( very obviously so on a cold and frosty morning ) , and the front grille was also adorned with the quattro badge from the Ur-Q . Inside , the cabin was identical except that the centre console received a differential lock switch , and LED bargraph displays in place of the GT 's three analogue-style gauges . Some Coup quattros were distinguished by a body-coloured rear spoiler . Mechanically , the Coup quattro depended on a combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The quattro permanent four-wheel drive drivetrain was almost identical to that used on the Ur-Quattro - the main differences being the use of the Coup GT front struts , smaller 256mm 0 diameter front brake disks , and lower ratios in the gearbox and rear differential . The damper and spring rates were also different from the Ur-Q . It was thus largely identical to the Audi 90 quattro and the North American Audi 4000 quattro . Roadwheels were 6.0Jx14 , with steel or aluminium alloy rims dependent on the market . 7.0Jx15 Ronals , almost identical to the Ur-Quattro wheels , were also available . The CQ/90Q/4000Q also received their own exhaust manifold and downpipe ( 5-3-1 , while FWD versions were 5-2-1 ) . From September 1980 to September 1987 , 174,687 ' ' Typ ' ' 81 Coups were built . Quattro production ran from late 1984 to 1988 , and was in the total region of 8,000 cars . 
4 Stat-Ease , Inc. is a privately held company producing statistical software in Minneapolis , Minnesota founded by Pat Whitcomb in 1982 . The company currently has 14 employees . The company provides software packages for engineers and scientists using Design of experiments methods ( DOE ) for optimizing development of products and processes . It also provides DOE training and consulting services . # History # Stat-Ease was founded by Pat Whitcomb while at General Mills in 1982 . He later brought in two of his General Mills colleaguesTryg Helseth as Programmer and Mark Anderson as Business Manager . Whitcomb and Anderson are Principals of the company today . The company sold its first software in June 1985 . Sales took off in 1987 when the software was described as incredibly easy to use in a review of DOE software . In 1988 , the company released its first version of Design-Expert software , which provided the tools for response surface methods ( RSM ) for process optimization . This package complemented Design-Ease , which handled factorial designs , and also provided statistical tools for optimizing mixtures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added the features of Design-Ease into Design-Expert version 5 and translated it from DOS to Windows . Both packages are still marketed today . In 1996 , ' ' Forbes ' ' Magazine said the new mantra for process improvement is multivariate testing ( MVT ) and added : A Minneapolis software firm , Stat-Ease , sells most of the software these MVT types use . Felix Grant , reviewing Design-Expert version 7.1.3 in ' ' Scientific Computing Magazine ' ' said : In a mature , well-established product which dominates its market , upgrades should be expected to reflect developing practice and display evolutionary growth rather than piling on attention-seeking gimmicks ; and so it is here ... Core functions have been extended usefully .. the design editor in Design-Expert ( DX ) has long been a strong point , providing a central cockpit from which to intuitively refine and test most aspects , but various new control features have now been added to the package , small in themselves but significantly enhancing productive control. # Statistical design of experiments # Minimum-Run Resolution IV and Minimum-Run Resolution V experimental designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Minimum-run resolution IV ( MR4 ) factorial designs estimate all main effects , clear of two-factor or higher interactions , in a minimum of experimental runs . MR4 designs work well for factor screening . Minimum-run resolution V ( MR5 ) factorial designs estimate all main effects and two-factor interactions in a minimum of experimental runs . MR5 designs are typically done after screening to a vital few factors , which then need to be studied in more depth in case they interact . Whitcomb and Oehlert won the Shewell award in 2008 for invention of the half-normal plot of effects for general factorials . They also developed statistical tools in 2008 to calculate power for a broad range of experimental designs and precision as a power substitute via fraction of design space ( FDS ) for response surface methods ( RSM ) and mixture design . Whitcomb and Anderson have written two non-academic books on DOE ; the books include a free educational version of Stat-Ease software . # Applications # Alberto-Culver developed a new line of scrubs using Design-Expert software from Stat-Ease . Stat-Ease was used by Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to demonstrate the application of model validation techniques to a structural dynamics problem . Stat-Ease was used by researchers to design experiments to optimize the effects of storage on the physico-chemical , microbiological and sensory quality on bottlegourd-basil leaf juice .

The researcher states : This experiment demonstrates how a robotically controlled microbioreactor system can be combined with DoE methods to optimize cell-culture media and feeding strategies . The new process is rich in information and provides a solid understanding of the most influential factors affecting performance of specific cell lines . The United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) evaluated the physicochemical properties of nine surfactants used in the remediation of perchloroethylene ( PCE ) in aqueous solutions using a response surface quadratic design model of experiment . Design-Expert software was used to generate the experimental design and perform the analysis .

4 Marguerite of Burgundy ( referred to as Anne by some sources ; 11921243 ) , was , by marriage , Countess of Savoy from 1233 until her death . She was the youngest daughter of Hugh III , Duke of Burgundy , and his second wife , Batrice of Albon . In c. 1217 , she married Amadeus IV , Count of Savoy . As dowry , she brought Miribel castle , Ornacieux castle , and other properties in Viennois territory . The marriage was agreed to as part of a treaty between the families , including terms not to acquire further territories within each other 's dominions . She and her new husband were also designated as heirs for her brother Guigues VI of Viennois after any children of his . She also personally inherited some money upon the death of her mother . The 1267 will of her nephew Guigues VII of Viennois confirmed donations of property which she had made .

One source calls her Anne , but that same source in another location indicates that the name could equally be Marguerite . Another source is clear that it is Marguerite , with sourcing of its own . A book about the house of Savoy at this time mentions the debate regarding her name , but finds a source which Cox finds settles the debate .

4 ( this article have only dead-link references , perhaps you are searching for JSON#JSONSchema ) JSON-WSP ( JavaScript Object Notation Web-Service Protocol ) is a web-service protocol that uses JSON for service description , requests and responses . It is very much inspired from JSON-RPC , but the lack of a service description specification with documentation in JSON-RPC sparked the design of JSON-WSP . The description format has the same purpose for JSON-WSP as WSDL has for SOAP or IDL for CORBA , which is to describe the types and methods used in a given service . It also describes inter-type relations ( i.e. nested types ) and defines which types are expected as method arguments and which types the user can expect to receive as method return values . Finally the description opens the possibility to add documentation on service , method , parameter and return levels . Communication between clients and a JSON-WSP server is carried out using HTTP POST requests and responses , with the JSON objects as data with the content-type application/json. # Specifications # JSON-WSP consists of four JSON object specifications : NOTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notation # # # Building blocks # # * If the name of the building-block being defined starts with rx- , it means that the definition is a regular expression . In these definitions square brackets have the role of defining character classes and parentheses have the role of defining capturing groups . * In all other cases , square brackets notate lists and parentheses notate either a decision : : <pre> ( d1 d2 .. ) </pre> a repetition of 0-many : <pre> ( .. ) * </pre> a repetition 1-many : <pre> ( .. ) + </pre> or something optional : <pre> ( .. ) ? </pre> # Common building-blocks # **19;1999;source <rx-freetext> = . * <rx-identifier> = a-zA-Za-zA-Z0-9* <rx-number> = 0-9+ <rx-boolean> = ( truefalse ) <key> = <rx-identifier> <primitive-value> = ( <rx-freetext> <rx-number> <rx-boolean> ) <value> = ( <primitive-value> ( <value> , ) * ( <key> : <value> , ) * ) <method-name> = <rx-identifier> <service-name> = <rx-identifier> </source> # Description object # # # Additional building-blocks # # **19;2020;source <primitive> = ( string number float attachment ) <service-locator> = **27;2041;rfc-1738 <type-name> = <rx-identifier> <member-name> = <rx-identifier> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <rx-freetext> <param-name> = <rx-identifier> <def-order> = <rx-number> <param-optional> = <rx-boolean> </source> # # Specification # # **26;2070;source type : jsonwsp/description , version : 1.0 , servicename : <service-name> , url : <service-locator> , types : ( <type-name> : ( <member-name> : <multi-type> ) + ) * , methods : ( <method-name> : doclines : ( <doc-string> , ) * , params : ( <param-name> : doclines : ( <doc-string> , ) * , deforder : <def-order> , type : <multi-type> , optional : <param-optional> , ) * , retinfo : doclines : ( <doc-string> , ) * , type : <multi-type> ) + </source> # # Descriptions # # <service-locator> : The service endpoint URL that accepts JSON-WSP POST request objects . <service-name> : Service name is case sensitive .

4 Rwanda-Rundi ( Ruanda-Rundi ) is a group of Bantu languages , specifically a dialect continuum , spoken in Central Africa . Neighboring dialects are mutually intelligible , but more distant ones may not be . Two dialects , Kirundi and Kinyarwanda , have been standardized as official languages of Burundi and Rwanda respectively . The other dialects are spoken in Tanzania ; Ha , with one million speakers , is the most important . # Comparison of Kinyarwanda and Kirundi # Kinyarwanda and Kirundi are very similar in many aspects , but differ in several ways as well . # Tonal marking # Both languages are tonal languages . High and low tones ( or H and L ) are the essential tones and , having a phonemic distinction on vowel length , when a long vowel changes from a low tone to a high tone it is marked as a rising tone and when a long vowel changes from a high tone to a low tone , it is marked as a falling tone . This is often illustrated in Kirundi in Meeussen 's Rule . Propositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metrical or rhythmic structure . # Spelling # # Word formation # There are many instances in which the two speech varieties of both languages have words that are slightly different . However , these differences do not continually recur . One has to memorize such differences as anga in Kinyarwanda in contrast to -anka in Kirundi ( meaning to dislike or hate ) , because the shift from g to k is extremely rare , with proof being words like inka ( cow ) , inkono ( pot ) and many other words where nk is common in both dialects . Such minor variations involve different consonants , vowels or vowel lengths , tones or affixes.

4 ' ' Erica turgida ' ' ( the Showy Heath or Kenilworth Heath ) is a species of erica that was naturally restricted to the city of Cape Town , South Africa , but is now classified as Extinct in the Wild . This small , delicate erica produces thin , willowy stems , covered in velvety hair . It produces masses of bright-pink , cup-shaped flowers . This Erica used to grow naturally in the area that is now beneath the Cape Town suburbs of Rondebosch , Kenilworth and Wynberg . It was therefore an endemic to the critically endangered Cape Flats Sand Fynbos vegetation type . Soon before the last wild population died out at Kenilworth Racecourse Conservation Area , a woman named Elsie Esterhuizen took cuttings to Kirstenbosch gardens and thus saved the species from permanent extinction . Along with its fellow extinct-in-the-wild heath , ' ' Erica verticillata ' ' , it is now being re-introduced to the Kenilworth Racecourse Conservation Area , now that the spread of the invasive alien vegetation there has been controlled .

514 George Faulkner ( 1790 ? &amp;ndash ; 1862 ) was the supposed originator of the foundation of Owens College , Manchester . Faulkner was born about 1790 in Oldham Street , Manchester , in which town his life was spent . In 1812 he entered into partnership in a well-established firm of silk , cotton , and linen manufacturers , which still , though no longer under his name , continues to prosper . For a time its business included a fine-spinning mill , in which Faulkner 's intimate friend , John Owens , was one of his partners . At some date before Owens 's death , which happened in 1846 he is said to have informed Faulkner that he had made his will , in which he had left all his property to his friend . Faulkner , the story continues , refused point-blank to accept another fortune in addition to his own .

He filled this post efficiently till August 1858 , taking repeated opportunities of supplementing his friend 's munificence by liberal benefactions of his own . He died 21 February 1862 , leaving behind him a justly honoured name .

Dev worked exclusively with American Electropop production duo The Cataracs , who helmed the production of the entire album along with co-writing songs with Dev . The production process of the album took place mainly in January 2011 and is currently continuing as the North American release date for the album was delayed from September 20 , 2011 to January 10 , 2012 as per Dev 's request to add more songs to the album , however , Amazon.com announced the album would be pushed back again to March 26 , 2012 . The album received mixed to positive reviews , with critics commending the production of many of the songs while comparing the music on the set to the electropop stylings of American recording artist Ke$ha and Swedish dance recording artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life stories over the past few years . ' ' The Night the Sun Came Up ' ' is mainly an electropop and dance-pop album , which incorporates elements of several musical genres such as dubstep and urban . The themes of the album range from sex , partying , introspection , love and life . In the United States , the album reached a peak of number sixty-one , selling 7,560 copies in its first week of release . It also peaked at number 136 on the UK Albums Chart . The first two singles from ' ' The Night the Sun Came Up ' ' , Bass Down Low and In the Dark , were both moderate international hits , with Bass Down Low peaking within the top ten of the UK Singles Chart . In the Dark was more successful in North America , peaking at number eleven on the ' ' Billboard ' ' Hot 100 in the United States and at number thirteen on the Canadian Hot 100 in Canada . It charted in more commercial markets , reaching the summit of the IFPI chart in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an Amy Winehouse ' ' Back to Black ' ' cover in response to her ex-boyfriend 's new girlfriend , calling it a diss track . The song was placed on Myspace and discovered by production team The Cataracs . She was then signed by the Los Angeles based record label and management team , Indie-Pop , who also discovered The Cataracs . Months later , their song 2Nite began to gain exposure on the radio , the television channel MTVU and the ' ' Billboard ' ' Hot Dance Airplay chart . In 2009 , Dev moved to Los Angeles to produce music with the Cataracs and work directly with Indie-Pop . During that time , songs like Fireball and Booty Bounce were made . The latter track was produced in the same summer as the The Cataracs produced Like a G6 , at the time where Dev and the Cataracs were grinding it out in the studio pretty tough together , making a couple of simplistic random tracks . Like a G6 , which features the Cataracs and Dev , was released in April 2010 , and reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hot 100 chart in October of that year , prompting Universal Republic to sign her on as an artist in the same month . # Recording and development # The album 's production process began in January 2011 in Costa Rica . The Cataracs , who helmed the entire album 's production , worked with Dev on the songwriting for the album , helping her with the themes to help diversify the content . She said that they were perfect producers for her , noting that they made really fun songs for kids on the radio and at the same time they were normal boys , eating burritos , chilling in Berkeley , which is what she felt connected her with them . She hinted early on in the interview that she had an interest in working with other people for the album , noting that other producers and writers have contacted her . She later came back stating I think me and The Cataracs are on a really good streak right now and it 's not intentional . Dev moved in with The Cataracs to produce the album . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a movie . She also claimed the experience gave the album an amazing vibe . On interview with Alex Kazemi of ' ' FashionIndie ' ' , Dev stated that their sessions are very different and complicated , further commenting It really depends , some times the boys will come to me and say Ive been wanting to do this song but this is more of a DEV track and from there Niles will show me the beat and me and David will come up with lyrics or some times I go to them when I have written some sort of idea and they will help me elaborate on it to the point where we can have a song . During the time they were in Costa Rica , they recorded thirteen to fourteen songs for the album . The song , Take Her From You , was composed while in Costa Rica recording the album . The song was originally written by one of The Cataracs for himself and while reading some of the lyrics , Dev expressed her interest in recording the song . # Concept and themes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape the comparisons to other artists in the electropop genre , including American recording artist Kesha and singer-songwriter Uffie . She noted that the comparisons helped motivate her to take the music to a new level and sing on the majority of the album . She further explains that the material on the album has more diversity , bringing together different sounds and conveying more depth in the songwriting . She described that the songs are influenced by hip hop and electro music . The album , according to Dev , will bring together my Dev intricate influences and The Cataracs simple influences . While on interview with KiSS 92.5 , she commented that the music on the set will contain music stylized toward club and dance music and hip-hop influenced tracks where she will rap the entire song . # Composition # ' ' The Night the Sun Came Up ' ' is primary an electropop and dance album , which incorporates elements of several different genres such as dubstep , hip hop , Eurodance , urban , rock and club influenced-pop music Dev said that her mission with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of music to make an eclectic set . She also said that the album has two sides to it , sassy and pretty . The sassy songs are based on the themes of sex , partying and different forms of debauchery while the pretty songs are contemplative ballads that are based more on introspection and love . Much of the album 's lyrics are influenced by her life and her experiences . The album opens with Getaway , a hip hop track with influences of soul music . The song starts out with the use of a piano , transitions into hip-hop styled music and features a breakdown in which she raps and rhymes . The next song In My Trunk runs through an electronic tinged hip hop beat and features vehicle metaphors in its lyrics . The third track of the album , Me , contains influences of adult contemporary music . The fourth song Breathe is an electronic dance song that contains influences of Middle Eastern and club music . It is written about sex and the effects of love on Dev and features the use of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her From You , differs completely from the electronic soundscape of the album , as it is inspired by rock and roll music . When Dev heard the song , she responded ' Oh , I really like that . It could almost be a flip of me singing about myself . ' .. We considered maybe we should change around the perspective , but I was like , ' No . Let 's keep it like that . ' The sixth track , Lightspeed , is an electronic pop song that in its production draws inspiration from house and club music . It makes use of kickdrums , synth arrangements , Auto-Tune and numerous noises like a cough . Its synth riff and beat structure resembles those in the music made by Dutch disc jockey Afrojack . The seventh track , Dancing Shoes is built upon synthesizers and drums while making use of pianos and guitars to produce an uptempo electronic rock ballad about performing onstage . The song 's pretty sound is inspired by teen pop music After Dancing Shoes is the eighth track , Perfect Match , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that featured in Clocks by British alternative rock group Coldplay . In Bass Down Low , the ninth song and first single , Dev speaks of taking shots and various forms of debauchery . It is an electro song with skittering synths and a pulsating electropop groove in which Dev utilizes her sing-talk vocal style throughout the song , but also uses her singing voice near the end . ' ' The Night the Sun Came Up s tenth track Kiss My Lips , the third single from the album in the United States , contains a guitar that blends synthesizers prominent in dance music with a hip hop styled drum beat . In the song , she sings to a lover Get you hand off my hip/And kiss my lips , kiss my lips , kiss me all over/ Are you gon na take that risk , take that risk , ' cause only getting older . In the Dark has a house rhythm and a prominent saxophone riff that serves as the song 's instrumentation . while featuring Eurodance beats and synths , mixed with influences of Latin music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draws from influences of folk music # Reception # # Critical reception # The album received generally favorable reviews from contemporary music critics with an aggregated score metascore of 71 of 100 in metacritic based on 4 reviews . Chuck Eddy from Rolling Stone gave to the album 3.5 out of 5 stars , writing that the album is as stark as it is sweet , owed partly to the casually giddy lightness of her talk-singing . Ben Norman from About.com gave to the album three stars out of five , summarizing that Dev 's debut album is at least little more than pandering to the mainstream . There are some interesting tracks that give us flashes of insight into the minds creating the works . Whether the credit goes to Dev or to her producers is uncertain but almost irrelevant , as long as you enjoy it . That being said , The Night The Sun Came Up is well-crafted , quality dance/pop . If Dev achieves another hit from it , I 'll be shocked . Jamie Horne of ' ' The Border Mail ' ' gave the album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noting the ranges of music influences , including dance , rock and folk , and noted that it was not boring . Chanun Poomsawai of Bangkok Post reviewed the album positively , praising its diversity and mixture of fierce and mellow and further commented that this is a solid electro-edged pop album best played while you 're getting dressed up before heading out for a night on the town . Elysa Gardner from USA Today wrote that on the album her fresh , lissome vocals are actually more intriguing than the textural , tonal and rhythmic shifts that pop up in the sometimes sweetly groovy but mostly unremarkable tunes . Music rating website ' ' Musicovered ' ' gave the album three out of ten stars , stating the album comes short of expectations and that the production was sloppy , with many of the album 's tracks sounding the same . Sal Cinquemani shares the same feeling on his review of the album for ' ' Slant Magazine ' ' , rating the album two and a half stars out of five . He adds that the album fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapping style , comparing it to that of Swedish recording artist Robyn , and the song In the Dark for blending European dance music with flourishes of Latin and Mediterranean music . Neil Miller , Jr . of UR Chicago rated the album two out of five stars ( on the site , they use meatballs ) , calling it one of the most unbalanced pop records ever released . Idolator however claims that to peg Dev as a Kesha clone is dangerous as she has a greater air of mystery than Kesha and the positive review ends with for those out there who like the soundtrack to their late-night fiesta to come with a bit more subtlety . # Commercial performance # In the United States , ' ' The Night The Sun Came Up ' ' debuted on the ' ' Billboard ' ' 200 chart on the week of April 14 , 2012 at number sixty one with 6,700 copies sold . # Singles # The debut single off the album is Bass Down Low , which was produced by and features The Cataracs .

027514 One of the key advertising campaigns of The Villages is that residents are able to play free golf for life . The advertising is only partially true ; the free golf is paid for by mandatory amenities fees assessed to all homeowners in The Villages . The free golf extends only to the executive golf courses and only to players walking the courses , wherein a greens fee is not assessed . Players riding golf carts on executive courses pay no greens fee but must pay a trail fee . Greens fees and trail fees are required on The Villages country club courses ( though memberships are provided free &amp;ndash ; again , as part of the amenities fee &amp;ndash ; to residents ) . # Executive Courses # All of The Villages ' executive courses are 9-hole layouts .

050514 Label = Varse Sarabande ' ' How to Train Your Dragon : Music from the Motion Picture ' ' was composed by John Powell for the film of the same name and released by Varse Sarabande on March 23 , 2010 . The score earned Powell his first Academy Award nomination and his third BAFTA nomination , which he lost to ' ' The Social Network ' ' and ' ' The King 's Speech ' ' , respectively . The score also won the International Film Music Critics Association 2011 Awards for Best Original Score for an Animated Feature and Film Score of the Year , and was nominated twice for Film Music Composition of the Year for the tracks Forbidden Friendship and Test Drive . # Background # ' ' How to Train Your Dragon ' ' was composer John Powell 's sixth collaboration with DreamWorks Animation . Powell had scored many of DreamWorks ' previous films , but this was the first of DreamWorks ' films where Powell helmed the score on his own ( on his previous efforts with DreamWorks , he had collaborated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Zimmer had long praised Powell 's abilities , and on many occasions , asserted that he was the superior composer between them , thus firmly supporting Powell 's first solo animation effort . For the score , Powell utilized many Celtic influences , employing instruments like the fiddle , bagpipes , dulcimer , pennywhistle , and even a harpsichord . Icelandic singer Jnsi was brought on to write and record the song Sticks &amp; Stones , which plays during the end credits of the film . In an interview with ' ' The Wrap s Steve Pond , Powell talked about his intent for the score : I was certainly trying to get a bit more epic . I just felt the animation and the visuals were giving me a broader palette to play with . As a kid I remember watching ' ' The Vikings ' ' with Tony Curtis and Kirk Douglas , and I always liked that score . The directors were really very specific a lot of the time . They did want size and depth and emotion . They wanted a feeling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past was Nielson , the Danish symphonist . Sibelius .

So that , plus it was great to have Jnsi do a song at the end of the movie , because I 've always liked moody Icelandic band Sigur Rs . They were an influence as well , even though that seems paradoxical . But there is that in a few cuesheavy , dark guitar textures going on at the same time as large orchestration .

The music also won an Annie Award for the Best Music in a Feature Production from the International Animated Film Association , ASIFA-Hollywood . Christian Clemmensen , founder of ' ' Filmtracks.com ' ' and member of the IFMCA , praised the score , saying that Powell has finally managed to create a well rounded and more easily digestible variation on his typical mannerisms for ' ' How to Train Your Dragon ' ' . He however criticized the use of Scottish and Irish tones in a score meant for Vikings , as well as the Jnsi song Sticks &amp; Stones , which he felt drained all the enthusiasm out of the environment created by Powell . However , Clemmensen still awarded the score the highest rating of five stars , and later listed the score as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed similar opinions about the score . Jonathan Broxton , founder of and another member of the IFMCA said : Its very rare that one can listen to an entire 70+ minute album and honestly say that all of them have musical merit , but that is genuinely the case here . Usually scores of this length have a fair amount of filler , but on ' ' How to Train Your Dragon ' ' every cue has worth . Archie Watt from ' ' MovieCues ' ' said : I sincerely hope that Powells work will be rewarded with an Oscar in 2011 . It couldnt be more deservedthe score is by far the best of the year to date , and I cant foresee any other score taking that accolade from this masterpiece .

093514 The Porticus Catuli ( Portico of Catulus ) was a landmark ( Latin ' ' monumentum ' ' ) on the Palatine Hill in ancient Rome . It was built by Quintus Lutatius Catulus ( consul 102 BC ) to commemorate his joint victory with Gaius Marius over the Cimbri at Vercellae . The portico was adjacent to the house ' ' ( domus ) ' ' of Catulus , which Pliny the Elder regarded as one of the grandest built in the late 2nd century BC . The practice of expanding a family 's ' ' domus ' ' from the relatively modest structures of the mid-Republic began at this time . The Porticus Catuli became known for the display of art works there . Its impressiveness rivaled that of the Temple of Honor and Virtue built by Marius also to commemorate the victory , for which both men earned a triumph . The Porticus Catuli was located on a prominent piece of real estate that had already been highly politicized . It had formerly been the site of the house of M. Fulvius Flaccus , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned to death and had their property confiscated and destroyed . In the mid-1st century BC , the Porticus Catuli was involved in the feud between Cicero and Clodius . When Cicero was condemned to exile for putting Roman citizens to death without allowing them right of appeal , Clodius razed Cicero 's house and perhaps also the Porticus Catuli to build a shrine ' ' ( aedes ) ' ' to Libertas . If the portico was razed rather than incorporated into the new religious complex , it was rebuilt along with Cicero 's house when the orator was restored to Rome . 
105514 birthplace = Vitebsk , Belarus Lev Samuilovich Klejn ( born 1927 ) , better known as Leo Klejn , is a Russian archaeologist , anthropologist and philologist. # Early life # Klejn was born on 1 July 1927 in Vitebsk , Belarus , to two Jewish physicians , Polish-born Stanislav Semenovich ( originally Samuil Simkhovich ) and Asya Moysseevna . Both of Klejn 's grandparents were wealthy : one a factory owner , the other a highly ranked merchant . Stanislav Semenovich served as a medical officer in the anti-Bolshevik Volunteer Army during the Russian Civil War . By the end of the war he had joined the Red Army , but was never a member of the Communist Party . In 1941 both of Klejn 's parents were drafted to serve in the Great Patriotic War , while the rest of the family were evacuated , first to Volokolamsk and then Egoryevsk near Moscow , and then to Yoshkar-Ola in the Mari ASSR . There Klejn worked on a collective farm before leaving school at the age of 16 and being attached to the 3rd Belorussian Front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Grodno and Klejn studied for a year at a Railway Technical School . While still in high school Klejn created an underground liberal organisation called ' Prometheus ' . This drew the attention of the KGB , but owing to the age of those involved there were no serious consequences . # Career # Upon graduating high school Klejn entered the Grodno Pedagogical Institute in the Faculty of Language and History . In 1947 , after a year there , he spoke against the First Secretary of Grodno 's Party Committee at a conference and was forced to leave . He transferred to Leningrad State University , first as a corresponding student , and then full-time . At Leningrad he studied both archaeology under Mikhail Artamonov and Russian philology under Vladimir Propp . While there he continued to act contrary to Party dogma by reading a paper criticising the work of Nicholas Marr . Klejn escaped expulsion for this , however , as shortly thereafter Marr 's theories were denounced by Stalin himself . Graduating with honours from the Faculty of History in 1951 , Klejn worked as a librarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leningrad for postgraduate studies in archaeology . He began working in the Department of Archaeology in 1960 and became an Assistant Professor there in 1962 . This was unusual as Klejn was a Jew and not a member of the Party , but he was appointed to the position by a special session of the faculty 's Party Bureau on the strength of his academic qualifications . He was awarded a Candidate of Sciences degree ( equivalent to a PhD ) in 1968 , defending a thesis on the origins of the Donets Catacomb culture . In 1976 he was made Docent ( Associate Professor ) . Klejn 's first printed work was published in 1955 ; his first monograph in 1978 . He participated in a series of archaeological fieldwork expeditions in Russia , Belarus and Ukraine , the last 5 seasons as head of the expedition . These included excavations of early Rus ' towns and Bronze Age and Scytho-Sarmatian barrows. # Persecution # Klejn continued to chafe against the Party-backed academic establishment as a teacher . In the 1960s , he organised a series of seminars on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he contradicted the anti-Normanist position . Then in the seventies he began working on theoretical problems in history and archaeologya subject that had been completely neglected since Stalin 's purges of academia in the 1930sand found himself contradicting the orthodox Marxist theory of historical materialism . His frequent publication in foreign journals also caused alarm . In the early 1970s Klejn 's brother Boris , then teaching in a Grodno institute , was dismissed and stripped of his degree and title for speaking against the introduction of Soviet troops into Czechoslovakia . His friendship with the disgraced Belarusian writer Vasil Bykov also played a part in this . Then in 1981 Klejn himself was arrested for homosexuality on the orders of the KGB . During a search pornography was planted on him , but too crudely , and the court could not accept the evidence . Nevertheless , Klejn was convicted and imprisoned . The scholarly community , however , interpreted this as an attempt to get rid of a troublemaker rather than a genuine accusation and came to his defence . Klejn neither affirmed nor denied the charge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual 's sexual orientation is not the concern of society or the state . But in his account he relates a parallel investigation conducted by his fellow inmates ( to determine his treatment ) which concluded he was not a homosexual . Eventually the initial sentence was overturned by a higher court and commuted to eighteen months detention , which by this time Klejn had almost served . After his release Klejn , like his brother , was stripped of his degree and title . He recorded his prison experiences under the pen name Lev Samoylov in the journal ' ' Neva ' ' and in his own name in the book ' ' The World Turned Upside Down ' ' # Later career # Klejn remained without an academic position for ten years following his release . Following ' ' perestroika ' ' he began publishing again and , in 1994 , defended a new thesis and was awarded a Doctor of Sciences degree by unanimous vote . He co-founded the European University at St. Petersburg and taught there until his retirement in 1997 at the age of 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of institutions , including the Universities of West Berlin , Vienna , Durham , Copenhagen , Lubljana , Turku , Tromse , Washington in Seattle and the Higher Anthropological School of Moldova . In 2001 he stopped teaching following treatment for cancer ; but continues to research and publish . He is currently a columnist in the ' ' Troitsky Variant ' ' . # Work # A whole series of Klejns books and articles on this subject are terminated by his Metaarchaeology of 2001 ( in Russian Introduction to theoretical archaeology of 2004 ) . # Theoretical archaeology # Klejn has been a one of the world 's leading writers on theoretical archaeology , a term he coined , since the 1970s . According to Klejn , archaeological theories are programs of information processing based on a particular explanatory idea . Additionally , theories become methodology by stipulating a set of standard techniques . Klejn 's elaboration of a special theory for archaeology went against the Soviet view that historical materialism was the only theoretical basis of the humanities . It also was in conflict with the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing all other humanistic and social scientific disciplines studying the past . According to Klejn , archaeology is not a sub-field of history nor history armed with a spade , as an influential school of Russian archaeology maintained , but a source-studying discipline similar to forensic science in its methodology . It processes archaeological sources , and translates them into the language of history , and finally transfers them to the historian for their incorporation into a historical synthesis . Archaeology 's typical questions are what , when , where , whence and how , whereas the historian 's question is why or from what cause . Klejn places particular emphasis upon rigorous methods of interpretation , in order to guard against the manipulation of antiquities in the service of political aims . His ' echeloned archaeology ' outlined three research procedures : empirical , deductive and problem-setting , each with a clear succession of stages of investigation , adjusted to different aims of research . His work on classification and typology in archaeology attempted to outline a strategy for producing classifications that are both useful and objectively valid . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian archaeology , stressed that some initial knowledge about the material to be classified as a whole is necessary to construct a reliable system of classification , and therefore that the process must work ' backwards ' ( relative to the received procedure ) from cultures to attributes . #From a study of the principles underlying the interpretation of archaeological material Klejn came to a dialectical inference that they are grouped in two rows , with every principle in each row directly facing its opposite in the other row . Both rows are active in archaeology , and both are valid . One either has to choose one of them or to find balance between two . This discovery has implications for the project of working out the artificial intelligence of an archaeologist . This position is detailed in The Principles of Archaeology ( 2001 ) . #Klejns interest in ethnogenesis forced him to deal with the problem of how to synthesise different kinds of sources and with the place of archaeological sources in this synthesis . In Klejns opinion ethnos is a category of in social psychology . This implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of ethnos , and any real attributes ( the community of language , race , religion , culture and so on ) are attached in various combinations to this notion . Practically the problems of ethnogenesis are reduced to discovering the origins and history of language communities . So the question of peoples origins is first of all a linguistic problem . However there is no inevitable coincidence of language with archaeological culture , and even less is there a coincidence of the lines of succession of language and culture . Usually archaeological culture has many roots and there is no inevitability that the language will be transmitted together with the most intensive cultural contribution . This is why lingual continuity does not correspond with cultural . Cultural genesis is not ethnogenesis . In tracing lines of lingual continuity from a synthesis of different sources the lingual sources must be given priority . Archaeological sources can only check and support in these investigations . #Klejn criticised the idea of omnipresent local origins , an idea that was inherited from Marrs teaching and was established by ideological considerations ( as allegedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more freedom in the reconstruction of migrations than the previous overcautious criteria . In his struggle against illusions of local origins he introduced the concept of sequentions ( sequences of cultures ) , with a distinction between column and track sequentions ( the latter are unconfined to a single territory ) . Archaeological material is given us in column sequentions and has to be transferred to track sequentions. #Historiography . Having exposed and evaluated various trends and having checked the general theories of archaeology with regard to their realisation , for Klejn the history of archaeological discipline naturally became a branch of theoretical archaeology . He had much to do with this branch . His A Panorama of Theoretical Archaeology ( 1977 ) caused a discussion in the world literature . Bruce Trigger greeted the emergence of such work from the Soviet side with the words : No longer from another planet . Klejn was the first who acquainted Russian archaeology with new trends in the world archaeology . His book The New Archaeology ( 2009 ) was published thirty year after it was written but was previously read in manuscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared as the first history of world archaeology in Russia no such book had previously existed in Russia . The two-volume History of Russian Archaeology Personified provides for the first time a new approach to the history of a discipline : presenting , separately , the history of events , the history of ideas and the history of persons ( biographies ) . His book The Phenomenon of Soviet Archaeology ( 1993 ) gives the first full and frank analysis of Soviet archaeology and covers the period up to just after the end of the Soviet era ( it had begun to be written before this time ) . The book has been translated into Spanish , German and English . # Klejns particular archaeological studies # #In regard to particular archaeological studies , Klejn has mainly studied the Catacomb culture of the Bronze Age ( III Mill . B.C. ) in the Ukraine and on the Volga-Don steppes . He excavated barrows on the steppes of the Ukraine and in southern Russia , and the subject of his Candidate dissertation was catacomb burials . At first he completely denied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jutland via the Danube plain . Later ( in 1970 ) he argued that this is not a single culture but several cultures ( this is now accepted by all ) . Finally , on the basis of comparison with cultures of India and the Rig-Veda , he came to the inference that these were ancestors of Indo-Aryans . He therefore conceded that the local population of the Pit-grave culture played a role in the formation of Catacomb cultures : the Pit-grave culture had long ago been connected to that of the Aryans ( Indo-Iranian , i. e . Indo-Aryans and Iranians ) . Such an early separation of Indo-Aryans from Iranians leads to a revision of the time when the split of Indo-European community occurred this must also have happened earlier than had previously been thought . #Ethnogenesis . From the very beginning Klejn had a keen interest in problems of ethnogenesis his first printed work ( 1955 ) was devoted to the origin of Slavs . Later Klejn delved deeply into problems of the origins of Indo-Europeans , especially their south-eastern branch Aryans , Greeks , Armenians , Phrygians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past Greco-Aryans including ancestors of Aruans , Greeks , Arnebians and Phrygians . His books Ancient Migrations and The time of Centaurs : the steppe Urheimat of the Aryans and Greeks were devoted to these problems . #The Norman problem . It is said that as an historian and archaeologist L. S. Klejn contributed to resurrection of the so-called Normanist theory , assigning to the Vikings a significant role in the establishment of the Ancient Russian state and seeing the Ryurikovichs ( the first Russian dynasty ) as having Scandinavian origins . Yet this is an over-simplification . Klejn played a part in the controversy of anti-Normanism versus alleged Normanism , and was even the main disputant in the third public dispute on this question ( each dispute being separated from the last by the space of a century ) . In the first Miller argued fiercely against Lomonosov , in the second Pogodin against Kostomarov , in the third Klejn against Shaskolsky . In the Soviet time the acceptance of the participation of Normans in the building of Russian state was held to be antipatriotic , dangerous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope of Normanism in order that this concept this accusation - could not be put on him ( and other objective investigators ) . Over the years Klejn began to advance more frankly . In his opinion , there is in fact no Norman theory : Normanism does not exist and never did as an academic doctrine . By contrast , anti-Normanism does exist - but only as an ideological platform , based on a Russian inferiority complex . It is very characteristic that , although Normans captured large parts of Britain and France and conducted raids into Germany , Spain and Byzantium , anti-Normanism exists only in Russia . Neither the French nor British deny these facts . The struggle of anti-Normanism against Normanism is not a criticism of some theory but simply an argument about the facts . There are now many eminent Russian scholars who take the same position ( A. N. Kirpichnikov , E. A. Melnikova , E. N. Nosov , V. Ya . Petrukhin a. o . ) . Klejns contribution is that in his work The Varangian Controversy he exposes in detail the arguments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is significant that he has structured the discussion by placing the arguments on the steps of a ladder leading to the most odious positions . So now the chaotic multiplicity of facts and ideas relating to the subject has received a structure and an order . It has become easier to evaluate the meaning of every reason when one has in mind its place in the whole discussion . #Klejn is also responsible for certain other original archaeological studies and hypotheses : the identification of the so-called zoomorphic sceptres of Eneolithic ; the study of dice in steppe barrows ; the detailed study of Karbuna hoard of Early Tripolyean culture ; the identification of pre-Hittites with Baden culture ; the reconstruction of Phrygian migration to India a thousand years before Alexander the Great ; etc .. # Philological works # Klejns Homeric studies are remarkable in Russian philology the books Anatomy of Iliad , Incorporeal Heroes and other works ( they are nearly unknown to the West since they have not yet been translated ) . Klejns studies of Homer in the 80s issued from his study of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a course of lectures on the Bronze Age of Europe at Leningrad University ) . He paid heed to the fact that the city excavated in Hissarlyk ( Turkey ) is radically different from Troy as described in the Iliad . Aside from the inconsistencies between text and reality , it might be wondered why the main heroes and other phenomena have double names . In the epic : Troy is Ilios , the river Scamandre is also Xanthos , the Trojan prince is called sometimes Paris , sometimes Alexander ; the main heroes of Greeks , Achilles and Diomedes , perceive the same deeds and even are wounded in the same spot ( in the ankle ) and in the poem they do nt meet each other - when one emerges the other disappears . Klejn reached the conclusion that Germans of the 19th and early 20th centuries ( H. Dntzer , Th . Bergk , A. Fick , P. Kauer , E. Bethe a. o. ) were right : the epic was put together from different songs having their own ( and parallel ) heroes . By means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by distribution of epithets as well as by the distribution of words ( in the original Greek of course ) . In this manner it appeared possible to discern in the text 6 independent sources united in the epic as scattered parts interspersed with each other . Further studies showed that the main heroes of Iliad Achilles , Ajax , Nestor and others were not historical personalities as they are presented in the epic but rather half-mythical cult heroes almost akin to Christian saints , each responsible for a special sphere of life : Achilles was a warden of ships , Nestor a healer , Odysseus a magician and fortune-teller and so on , and in the poem , however they are addressed , they are essentially occupied with their initial business . Klejn ( in common with some scholars before him ) came to the inference that there was no historical Trojan war and no capture of Troy by Greeks . We possess not the slightest of archaeological proofs for these things , while , on the contrary , there are plenty of refutations . In general , epic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are transformed into just the reverse : defeats turn out to be victories . The city excavated by Schliemann is not Troy at all , although it is Ilios . In the Hittite written sources two different towns are mentioned in the West of Asia Minor : Truya this is Troy , and Wilusa this is Greek ( W ) ilios . In Klejns books there are many maps , comparative tables and statistical charts . The most eminent Russian historian of the ancient world Igor M. Dyakonov declared in print that Klejns inferences are impossible to disprove and that possibly from these books a new epoch in Homeric studies begins . # Klejns anthropologic studies # Klejn himself holds that his communication theory of cultural evolution is his most interesting contribution to anthropology , although he could not succeed in working out this theory in detail ( it is presented only in some minor articles ) . Many modern students imagine culture as a certain amount of information . But if so , then the transmission of culture from one generation to the next can be presented as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . In that case , the flow of information will be exposed to the impact of the same factors as influence any chain of communication ( radio , telephone etc . ) . In order that the information get through , we need repetition , a quantity of channels with a good transmission capacity etc . It remains to be worked out what cultural phenomena - promoting or hindering the transmission of information - correspond to these physical factors . For instance , channels of communication might include family , school , court , club , etc . The repetition of the cultural information might be daily ( washing yourself , table customs etc. ) , or weekly ( division on weekdays and holydays ) , etc .. It may be possible to include mathematical formulas of cultural evolution within this theory ; and it may be possible to use this theory in the present day for the , so to say , indirect direction of culture . There are explanatory uses for this theory in archaeology . For instance , with respect to the explanation of migration : if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warriors they simply could not learn from their homeland those forms of culture that were only seldom repeated , for example , burial customs . In such a case although a migration might have occurred we would not necessarily expect to find the wholesale transference of all forms of culture . In a number of works Klejn discusses the idea of the contradiction between modern culture and the nature of man . This treatment is far from the Rousseaus mood and is built on the basis of socio-biology . Developing the ideas of Lorenz and Desmond Morris , Klejns idea is built upon the fact that in every stage of mans biological evolution man has been formed by adaptation to conditions not only of the natural environment but also of the socio-cultural milieu . However tempos of socio-cultural evolution are much faster than those of biological evolution : socio-cultural evolution has no need to wait for generations to change . While biological evolution has not terminated even a single stage of homo sapiens , socio-cultural evolution has gone through the Upper Palaeolithic , Mesolithic , Eneolithic , Neolithic , Bronze and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now entered the Atomic and Computer Age . Yet our psycho-physiological characteristics remain the same as in the Stone Age they were , and are , adapted to those conditions . This accords with Freuds observation : we are discontent with modern culture because we are not by our nature adapted to it . Hence there are a number of specific deceases and psychic problems that are developing into social ones . Yet in culture a number of compensatory mechanisms exist to diminish this tension . However , when in some milieus there is a lack of culture , from mans inside there bursts a savage , and thus society , when left to self-organization ( as in Lord of the Flies ) , restores ( mutatis mutandis ) primordial forms of life . This can be seen in the example of hard labour camps , bullying ( by age ) among army troops , etc .. This idea is worked out by Klejn in the book The World Turned Upside Down ( in journal form 19881991 and in the book form 1993 , several editions and translations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion is another theme of Klejns anthropological studies . Having found traces of Peruns cult in Vaynakh ( Chechen and Ingush ) folklore , Klejn first looked for historical remnants of an ancient intrusion of Slavic paganism into the Caucasus . He connected the traces of Peruns cult not only with those sparse relics of this cult that were kept in Russian culture but also with the wide circle of ethnographic phenomena of that culture . Peruns cult appeared to be connected with images of Rusalka , Yarilo , Kostroma and others . Klejn interpreted Perun himself to be a dying and resurrecting god ( many such gods are found in the mythologies of various countries ) . Many other problems were also solved . So , Maslenitsa appeared to be , according to Klejn , not an ancient festival , but pagan solstice rites that were moved aside to make way for Christian fasts . Klejn considers Veles to be a late deity imitating the Christian St. Vlasius . These positions are mainly expounded in the book Resurrection of Perun : an approach to the reconstruction of East-Slavic pagan religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was published in 2010 . Having also a musical education ( piano ) , in his student years Klejn was the leader of a popular music group , in his teaching years he was responsible for amateur musical performances at the University . In the 70s he wrote a book on music where he established connections between rock and classical music , but the manuscript , having slipped into Samizdat , had to be brought before the KGB and was not published at that time . It has not become obsolete . Klejns reflections on music are of an anthropological character . He considers various systems of harmony and establishes their correspondence to the social psychology of different epochs . Many systems of classical music influence , and have their equivalents , in popular music . The book is not written exclusively for professional musicians : it is in accessible language . After Klejn was accused of homosexual relations , he became interested in the question of homosexuality in general and began to study it . Approaching it as an anthropologist , he classifies the question as falling under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conclusion that homosexuality is not in any way contagious and is not inherited through the male line , that in different societies and in different epochs its distribution is approximately equal , only the degree of reticence varies . Klejn consistently advocates its decriminalisation and de-medicalisation but at the same time , as distinct of other liberal figures , he a ) considers homosexuality in its biological respect a pathology ( while , in cultural respects , norms of behaviour are conventional and culturally dependent ) ; b ) he does not consider gay-pride actions ( mistakenly called in Russia gay-parades ) to be reasonable and appropriate ( actions in defence of the civil rights of gays are another issue ) ; c ) he is sharply critical of the homosexual sub-culture . His book The Other Love considers various theories and views on homosexuality from ancient times to the present , theories about the origins of homosexuality , and the evolution of homosexuality in various societies and in various historical periods . The book Another Side of the Luminary considers the unusual love of outstanding personalities . Specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known Russian figures , from Ivan the Terrible to Rudolf Nureev . Still in manuscript there is a third book devoted to non-Russian figures , from Socrates and Plato to Leonardo and President Lincoln . The aim of the book is not to justify homosexuality by referencing famous homosexuals but rather to consider how outstanding personalities coped with this difficult psychological problem not all of them are regarded as positive figures . Among Klejns entire works this topic occupies a relatively small space , but it is reasonable to provide brief expositions of these books because on the internet these books have been frequently reproduced , but in a misleading way usually without the inclusion of critical chapters - and so give a false impression . # Klejns Influence # One may sometimes meet the expression Klejns school . However , Klejn himself withholds judgement as to whether such a school exists is a matter of convention : it is dependent upon what is taken as a school . Yet his impact on archaeology ( and not only archaeology ) is undoubted and is underlined by the calling of a discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England . This will be devoted to Klejns contribution to Russian , European and world archaeology . A number of known scholars had the experience of Klejns seminar : V. S. Bochkarev , V. A. Safronov , M. B. Shchukin , G. S. Lebedev , V. A. Bulkin , B. A. Raev , Yu.Yu . Piotrovsky , I. V. Dubov , E. N. Nosov , Yu . M. Lesman , L. B. Vishnyatsky , E. M. Kolpakov , O. A. Shcheglova , A. D. Rezepkin , V. Ya . Stegantseva , V. A. Dergachev , A. A. Kovalev , A. M. Smirnov , S. Zh . Pustovalov , and many others . V. A. Lynsha and other students who came to Leningrad from other universities , in order to supplement their training , also established themselves as Klejns pupils . Those who studied under Klejns guidance or experienced his influence were not only archaeologists ; there were , among others , also the philosopher-logician B. I. Fedorov , the anthropologist A. G. Kozintsev , the linguist N. N. Kazansky , the orientalist M. A. Rodionov , the art historian V. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas affected the whole of Leningrad-Petersburg archaeology as well as many archaeologists in northwest Russia , Siberia , Ukraine and Moldavia ; archaeologists in Moscow were also affected by Klejns work to the extent that it was through him that ideas from outside of Russia became known . As concerns relations with Western archaeology , in the most difficult years for international cooperation it was Klejn who showed to world archaeologists that Soviet archaeology was nevertheless no longer from another planet ( Triggers expression ) . He supported the virtues of Russian archaeology in that he demonstrated that it contained erudition , the urge toward objectivity and creative potentials . # Political views # L. S. Klejn is a convinced adherent of liberal values , and an adversary of xenophobia and nationalism . He is a whole-hearted supporter of civil rights , but his democratic ideal is qualified : he does not idealise egalitarianism and anarchy . His humanitarianism is also qualified : in his view charity should not stimulate parasitism and so do harm to society . He is unsatisfied with the oversimplified polar contraposition between patriotism and rusophobia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To him , such sort of patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel . Proper patriotism is love of ones own country and people , and does not exclude esteem for other peoples . It is based on love and not hate . A sincere love is conjugated with the desire for ones people and country to reach towards perfection , and to correct the faults - and therefore to reveal them . And so criticism of a beloved people and country is not rusophobia but a proper patriotism , whereas the desire to hide defects reveals indifference to the people and the country , characteristic of populism and a slavish longing to serve those in power . In his article Diagnosis ' , Klejn details the ongoing process of Nazification of Russia both from above and below . # Selected bibliography # For a full bibliography ( over 500 titles ) see Archaeology.ru and to 2000 Arkheolog : Detectiv i myslitel ( Archaeologist : detective and thinker ) .

Not only that , she 's doing it better than even diehard defenders wouldve predicted . At 29 , the pop star whose career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shown that she 's back hopefully this time to stay . Evelyn McDonnell of ' ' Spin ' ' said that the idol America loves to hate went all out . Her body perpetually moved , she sang steadfastly into her headset ( okay , she 's got plenty of digital support , but she does n't merely lip-sync ) , and she shimmied through an endless parade of outfits . ... Having been knocked down by the tabloid press and the public repeatedly in recent years , Spears is now desperately seeking our attention . And she earns it . Haters go home . Kelley L. Carter of MTV commented that the Spears that captivated the audience at the Staples Center ... was the old , fun-loving , free-wheeling Spears with a sexy , showgirl twist . There was n't much pretense , though those glamazon outfits blinded in the best way possible . Instead , there was just good dance music . Carla Meyer of ' ' The Sacramento Bee ' ' stated that Though Spears performed like a pro throughout the show , hitting all her marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first stop on a tour . But that hesitancy vanished when she put on the denim . She seemed at ease . Shaunna Murphy of ' ' Entertainment Weekly ' ' criticized Britney 's complete lack of verbal audience interaction ... and her obviously diminished dancing ability but also added that with her slim waist , her dangerously toned legs , and most importantly her engaged , wide-eyed smile , Spears looked happy to be there with usthe crucial element that has been missing from so many Britney shows of late . August Brown of the ' ' Los Angeles Times ' ' stated that the Femme Fatale tour gets its drama by largely erasing or at least tweaking the past . ... Spears manipulates pops virgin-whore complex better than just about anyone , and her seamless sweep from lasciviously grinding on an awestruck dude from the audience to the earnest balladry of ' Do nt Let Me Be the Last to Know ' ... felt true to the sweep of her career she learned that she can control the narrative by vanishing into a club 's heat or into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' commented , Though visually impressive , the show lacked a truly engaging human quality . Spears moved with an almost mechanical detachment , lightly shifting through dance routines without fully letting her body release itself . With her voice heavily processed and laden with backing tracks , she appeared onstage as some strange blend of Michael Jackson , Madonna and Kraftwerk 's Ralf and Florian . However , ' ' Jam ! Canoe ' ' considered the show best described as Janet Jackson-like . Steve Palopoli of ' ' Metro Silicon Valley ' ' said , Musically , the show is heavy on the hits , although considering Britney as a musical phenomenon is like asking which of Madonna 's albums is best . She 's a cultural phenomenon , obviously , and the only edicts that seem to have been handed down in regards to the music is ' no lip-synching ' ( she definitely does n't ) and ' bigger and louder whenever possible . ' Shirley Halperin of ' ' The Hollywood Reporter ' ' stated it was entertaining , but Spears does nt quite have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant barrage of visual distractions while she mostly lip-synchs along to her hits . Jim Harrington of the ' ' Oakland Tribune ' ' deemed the show as a mess pretty much from start to finish . The theatrics are awkward and confusing , the dance routines are numbingly bland and old-hat , the song selection is weak and misguided , and Britney 's star power , so blinding on tours past , is remarkably dim . Alexis Petridis of ' ' The Guardian ' ' gave the show two stars out of five , saying that there 's a suspicion that the kind of person who goes to see Britney Spears live is n't really there for the music or her sparkling personality : tonight she seems as dead-eyed and distant as ever . What they 're interested in is proximity to a global celebrity . Neil McCormick of ' ' The Daily Telegraph ' ' gave the show one star out of five , and called it the saddest , laziest , dullest and most tawdry pop concert I have ever witnessed . He added that the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people , having forked out around 50 a head for tickets , practically raised the roof , cheering every dismal dance move , roaring for lip-synched vocals and lustily applauding limp erotica . # Commercial reception # Live Nation announced in early May 2011 a partnership with deal-of-the-day website Groupon . A spokesperson explained , Offering a deal on Groupon is not a reflection of the quality or status or sales of a show but rather segmented marketing and a way to reach new and additional consumers . A staff editor for VH1 noted that as of June 16 , 2011 , 18,000 tickets were sold at discounted prices through Groupon for fifteen of the first twenty-four dates of the tour , including 1,800 at opening night in Sacramento . The Groupon deals for shows in Seattle , Winnipeg , Saint Paul , and Atlanta actually expired before all available discounted tickets were sold . The editor also stated that the shows look to be under-attended in smaller cities , even as , in metropolitan areas like Greater New York City , new shows have been added . It remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better price optimization , or whether the tours ambition was more outsized than its actual draw . The Femme Fatale Tour was ranked at number fifty-five by Pollstar on the Top 100 North American Tours list , grossing $6.2 million in the first ten shows .

It had an average gross of $940,165 per city , and an average ticket price of $84.19 during the shows in North America . Worldwide , the Femme Fatale Tour was the eleventh highest-grossing tour of 2011 , with a gross of $68.7 million . 697,957 fans attended the shows worldwide , with an average attendance of 8,724 , paying an average of $98.43. # Broadcast and recordings # In July 2011 , a high-quality recording of the Las Vegas show was uploaded to YouTube . On July 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , Marc McDevitt , requested a subpoena at a federal court to obtain personal details from YouTube of the user who uploaded the video , including the IP address , e-mail address and any other relevant information to identify the person . Although it is common for major music labels to send takedown requests to YouTube , it is thought to be the first time the RIAA filed legal action against the video hosting site in order to obtain the personal details of an uploader .

180514 Monreith House is a category A listed Georgian mansion located east of the village of Port William in Mochrum parish , Dumfries and Galloway , Scotland . The classical-style house was designed by Alexander Stevens in 1791 , for Sir William Maxwell , 4th Baronet . The new house replaced the now-ruined Myrton Castle on the estate . The grounds of the house are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland , the national listing of significant gardens , and are classed as outstanding in five out of six categories . # History # The Maxwell family first acquired Monreith in the 15th century , and built Myrton Castle on the estate .

331514 6:02 AM EST is the 20th episode of the third season of the American science fiction drama television series ' ' Fringe ' ' , and the 63rd episode overall . The narrative follows the activation of the doomsday device by the parallel universe , and the subsequently devastating consequences experienced by our world . David Wilcox , Josh Singer , and Graham Roland co-wrote the episode , while Jeannot Szwarc directed it . Guest star Kevin Corrigan returned as the mysterious Sam Weiss . Actor John Noble and executive producer Jeff Pinkner have referred to 6:02 AM EST as the start of an epic trilogy , as it and the following two episodes would be linked in one continuous story arc . The episode received generally positive reviews ; many critics noted its purpose was meant to set the stage for the season finale . # Plot # In the parallel universe , Walternate has been able to use the blood sample from Fauxlivia 's child to create a serum made up of half of Peter Bishop 's DNA . He uses this serum to activate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this results in a series of unusual events , including the formation of a vortex that wipes out a long swath of land in rural New York state , including a herd of sheep and two of their shepherds . The Fringe division learns that their version of the machine activated at 6:02 AM on its own , and Walter suspects the two machines are tied by quantum entanglement , with their version of the machine destroying their world to stabilize the parallel one . Unknown to the prime universe , Walternate 's experiment has not affected the stability of their world . In the prime universe , Nina Sharp helps to set up Massive Dynamic 's resources to track these occurrences , preparing to deploy limited supplies of the amber substance to contain them if needed . Nina advises Olivia to find Sam Weiss , a man that William Bell had trusted and instructed Nina to also listen to . However , Sam has disappeared and can not be found . Walter and Peter , along with Massive Dynamic staff , debate how to disable the machine , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter comes to recognize that the Observer 's efforts from earlier ( The Firefly ) were to prepare him to lose Peter . After preparing himself , Peter goes to touch the machine , but is sent flying by an electrical spark , wounding him and knocking him unconscious . At the hospital chapel , Walter tries to find repentance from God for his actions , while Olivia arrives after hearing the news . She steps outside to observe the sunset when Sam Weiss runs up to her and demands to be taken to the machine to stop what is already happening . In the parallel universe , Walternate 's machine has been detected by the Fringe division and Fauxlivia and her team goes to investigate . When Walternate tells them to stand down , Fauxilivia asks him about her recent mission to the prime universe and the part that she recovered . Walternate admits to her that the machine has been activated , having sacrificed his own son Peter to allow Fauxlivia 's son to live . Fauxlivia becomes distressed at Walternate 's actions , and later returns to Liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the prime universe , but is caught before she can use them . Walternate locks her away , seeing her as a traitor to his cause . # Production # 6:02 AM EST was written by co-executive producers David Wilcox and Josh Singer , and executive story editor Graham Roland ; filmmaker Jeannot Szwarc directed it . Though the season 3 finale was scheduled to be just an hour long , executive producer Jeff Pinkner confirmed that the last three episodes would be linked in one continuous story arc . This was a reflection of Pinkner and fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman 's intent to have the last three episodes of every season seem like you 're turning the last page of a chapter in a novel . And usually in a good novel , the last pages of a chapter compels you forward with a new understanding of what the subject matter is and you get deeper and you cant wait to turn that page . Some media outlets have referred to the episodes as a three-part third-season finale . During a conference call with journalists , actor John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the third season an epic trilogy . He elaborated All year we 've been heading toward the fact that there seems to be an inevitable conflict between the two universes . And we 've gotten to know the people on both sides now , so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with ' 6:02 . ' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate . Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading . And so everyone has to move into another gear and say , ' Okay , this problem is not going to go away . It 's now affecting our side . We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem . ' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy , leading up to the use of that machine . In the same interview , Noble called the episode 's title very critical to the series , stating That time frame plays through the three episodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finale , that time frame . In March 2011 , TVline 's Michael Ausiello exclusively confirmed that previous guest actor Kevin Corrigan would be returning for the twentieth and twenty-first episodes of the season . Corrigan last appeared in the season 's twelfth episode Concentrate and Ask Again ; his role in 6:02 AM EST and the following week 's episode The Last Sam Weiss marked his sixth and seventh appearances on ' ' Fringe ' ' , respectively . As with other ' ' Fringe ' ' episodes , Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children , focusing on the science seen in 6:02 AM EST , with the intention of having students learn about weather forecasting . Ironically , the sunny post-daybreak conditions depicted as occurring at the time used as the episode 's title ( 6:02 AM Eastern Standard Time ) can not ever occur anywhere in New York state under the Daylight Saving Time rules used in the contemporary United States . Even on the very first days of the period in the autumn when DST ends and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet risen over any part of the state . The same is true on the last day of Standard Time in the spring ( even in Montauk , Long Island , which is the southeasternmost point of New York , the sunrise on the final day of EST in 2011 was at 6:06 AM ) . A better title for the episode would have thus have been 6:02 AM EDT . # Reception # # Ratings # On its initial broadcast in the United States , the episode was watched by an estimated 3.51 million viewers , with a 1.2/4 ratings share for those aged 1849 . It was seen by 14 percent fewer viewers than the previous week , though several other series airing that night were also down in viewers . The 1.2 ratings share resulted in a series low for ' ' Fringe ' ' . # Reviews # The A.V. Club 's Noel Murray graded the episode with an A- , explaining that though he did not want to give a full review until the season finale aired , he was enjoying how ' ' Fringe ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-cutting between Earth-1 and Earth-2 , and the sense of imminent doom . Murray continued that he especially liked .. that in the midst of all this end-times rush , it pauses periodically to check in with the various characters in short one-on-one scenes , strengthening our sense of what these relationships mean . ( It 's something that ' ' Fringe ' ' has gotten good at in the past year-and-a-half , and something I would n't have predicted for the show back in season one . ) Writing for the ' ' Los Angeles Times ' ' , critic Andrew Hanson noted ' ' Fringe ' ' is preparing for the finale , calling 6:02 AM EST a movement episode that gives an opportunity to get everyone into place for the big climax in a vein similar to the television series ' ' Lost ' ' . Hanson enjoyed the two sleights of hand , explaining he was surprised by Fauxlivia 's universe-crossing device failing and what happened to Peter after touching the machine . IGN 's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 7.5/10 , writing This week 's episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high marks for character development and putting the pieces in place for a great season finale . Like Hanson , Isler loved the outcome of Peter and the machine , calling it a nice plot twist ; he also praised Blair Brown as one of the many under-appreciated elements of the series . Writing for Mania.com , critic Kurt Anthony Krug acknowledged the episode had a tough act to follow after the previous week 's episode , but stated it 's still pretty good . Sarah Stegall from SFScope was happy to see Peter taking a more active role with the machine plotline , but disliked the episode 's religious elements , believing that Walter 's scene in the church felt forced . Stegall concluded her review noting This episode felt like the first part of a chess game , as the pieces are arranged on the board . The big move is coming up , the endgame that will decide who wins and who loses .

367514 The TshuapaLomamiLualaba Conservation Landscape ( TL2 ) was until very recently a remarkably unknown forested region in central Democratic Republic of Congo . # Geography # This landscape is known by three principal rivers , the Tshuapa , the Lomami , and the Congo River , known here as the Lualaba , giving the region its name : TL2 . The Tshuapa and Lualaba are its western and eastern borders ; the Lomami River flows through its center . This region covers over 40,000 km and is one of the largest blocks of intact forest in DRCongo . It has both low human population densities and little immigration . # Fauna # The most important populations of key fauna , including bonobo and elephant , occur in a central area that can be divided into three linked conservation sectors . Two primary conservation sectors , include one in Maniema Province and one in Orientale Province . Along with a third smaller sector in Kasai Oriental , surveys show that this region holds a major population of Congo 's great ape , the bonobo , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers . The concentrations of these two flagship species also correspond with the highest concentrations of many other large mammals , including primates , throughout this continuously forested landscape . The forests in the Lomami-Lualaba watersheds are the eastern range limit of Congos endemic great ape , the bonobo ( ' ' Pan Paniscus ' ' ) . Bonobos are found throughout most of TL2 , though occurrence is patchy and bonobos are uncommon in some areas where they are present . The largest concentrations of bonobos are found in the south of the landscape , toward the forest-savanna ecotone . Bonobos were recorded in only a few scattered locations in surveys outside the area defined as the TL2 Conservation Landscape , and the evidence suggests populations are small and scattered . Based on interviews with hunters and villagers , bonobos have disappeared from some of these areas over the last two decades as hunting levels increased . Forest elephants in the landscape are now restricted mainly to a single area in the watershed of the Tutu River , a tributary of the Lomami . It is an area of approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all highly mobile , occur elsewhere in the landscape . There is a reasonable prognosis for maintenance of forest elephants over the long term , but existing populations were nearly decimated after a decade of intense poaching , associated with the war and the widespread availability of military-grade firearms . Okapi occur on both sides of the Lomami River , representing an extension of the species known range . Okapi are , however , uncommon in the landscape . # Primates # Several species or subspecies of primates are limited in their distribution to the TL2 landscape region . A new species of primate , known vernacularly as the Lesula , was discovered in this region in 2007 . The Lesula is most closely related to the owl-faced monkey , ' ' Cercopithecus hamlyni ' ' . Significant work was subsequently undertaken over the next five years to complete the taxonomic classification of the new species and confirm the importance and significance of the discovery .

466514 full name = ' ' Jennings v Rice ' ' 2002 is an English contract law case concerning proprietary estoppel. # Facts # Mr Jennings , a gardener , sued the administrator of his former employer , Mr Rice , to have a large house worth 435,000 conveyed to him on the ground that he had been given an assurance he would get it . Mrs Royle , who lived at Lawn House , Shapwick , Somerset , died on August 11 , 1997 aged 93 , without a will or children . Mr Jennings had worked as her gardener since 1970 , but from the late 1980s had increasingly begun to care for her , doing washing , helping dressing , shopping and going to the toilet . She was running out of money and could not continue to pay him . She told him he need not worry about that since he would be alright and that this will all be yours one day . Mr Jennings claimed that either there was a claim under the Inheritance Act 1970 , or there was a contract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine of proprietary estoppel . The administrator contested the payment . The High Court awarded him 200,000 taking into account the payments Mr Jennings had forgone on the basis of proprietary estoppel , after rejecting the IA 1970 claim , and stating that Mrs Royle 's words had been too vague to make a contract . Mr Jennings appealed arguing that he should get the full sum even under proprietary estoppel , while Mr Rice argued that although the full value of the house was the maximum awardable , the court should take into account the actual detriment experienced . # Judgment # The Court of Appeal held that the High Court had made a correct assessment , and proportionality was essential between expectation and detriment in deciding how to satisfy an equity based on proprietary estoppel . Although the detriment to Mr Jennings was more difficult to establish than his expectation , courts must consider unconscionability . In agreeing that the appeal should be dismissed , Robert Walker LJ said the following . 43 . It can not be doubted that in this as in every other area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can not exercise a completely unfettered discretion according to the individual judge 's notion of what is fair in any particular case . Dr Gardner 's fourth hypothesis ( the approach is for the court to adopt whatever style and measure of relief it thinks fit , for whatever reason it thinks fit ) can not be right . I do not think that the judgment of Hobhouse LJ in ' ' Sledmore v Dalby ' ' ( 1996 ) 72 P&amp;CR 196 ( to which I shall return ) can possibly be regarded as adopting or advocating an unfettered judicial discretion . 44 . The need to search for the right principles can not be avoided . But it is unlikely to be a short or simple search , because ( as appears from both the English and the Australian authorities ) proprietary estoppel can apply in a wide variety of factual situations , and any summary formula is likely to prove to be an over-simplification . The cases show a wide range of variation in both of the main elements , that is the quality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of the claimant 's detrimental reliance on the assurances . The doctrine applies only if these elements , in combination , make it unconscionable for the person giving the assurances ( whom I will call the benefactor , although that may not always be an appropriate label ) to go back on them . 45 . Sometimes the assurances , and the claimant 's reliance on them , have a consensual character falling not far short of an enforceable contract ( if the only bar to the formation of a contract is non-compliance with section 2 of the Law of Property ( Miscellaneous Provisions ) Act 1989 , the proprietary estoppel may become indistinguishable from a constructive trust : ' ' Yaxley v Gotts ' ' 2000 Ch 162 ) . In a case of that sort both the claimant 's expectations and the element of detriment to the claimant will have been defined with reasonable clarity . A typical case would be an elderly benefactor who reaches a clear understanding with the claimant ( who may be a relative , a friend , or a remunerated companion or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the benefactor , the claimant will inherit the benefactor 's house ( or will have a home for life ) . In a case like that the consensual element of what has happened suggests that the claimant and the benefactor probably regarded the expected benefit and the accepted detriment as being ( in a general , imprecise way ) equivalent , or at any rate not obviously disproportionate . Cases of that sort , if free from other complications , fit fairly comfortably into Dr Gardner 's first or second hypothesis ( both of which aim to vindicate the claimant 's expectations as far as possible , and if possible by providing the claimant with the specific property which the benefactor has promised ) . 46 . However the claimant 's expectations may not be focused on any specific property . In ' ' Re Basham ' ' 1986 1 WLR 1489 the deputy judge ( Mr Edward Nugee QC ) rejected the submission that there must be some clearly identified piece of property , and that decision has been approved more than once in this court . Moreover ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the claimant 's expectations may have been formed on the basis of vague and inconsistent assurances . The judge said of Mrs Royle that she .. was prone to saying different things at different times and , perhaps deliberately , couched her promises in non-specific terms . He made that observation in relation to the failure of the contract claim , but it is relevant to the estoppel claim also . 47 . If the claimant 's expectations are uncertain ( as will be the case with many honest claimants ) then their specific vindication can not be the appropriate test . A similar problem arises if the court , although satisfied that the claimant has a genuine claim , is not satisfied that the high level of the claimant 's expectations is fairly derived from his deceased patron 's assurances , which may have justified only a lower level of expectation . In such cases the court may still take the claimant 's expectations ( or the upper end of any range of expectations ) as a starting point , but unless constrained by authority I would regard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not see that approach as being inconsistent with authority . On the contrary , I think it is supported by a substantial body of English authority . Scarman LJ 's well-known reference to the minimum equity to do justice to the plaintiff ( ' ' Crabb v Arun District Council ' ' 1976 Ch 179 , 198 ) must no doubt be read in the context of the rather unusual facts of that case , but it does not stand alone . As Scarman LJ recognised , the line of authority goes back to nineteenth-century cases such as ' ' Duke of Beaufort v Patrick ' ' ( 1853 ) 17 Beav.60 and ' ' Plimmer v Wellington Corporation ' ' ( 1884 ) 9 App Cas 699 . A passage in the opinion of the Privy Council ( delivered by Sir Arthur Hobhouse ) in Plimmer 's case at pp.713-4 is particularly instructive . The conclusion of the passage is that In fact the court must look at the circumstances in each case to decide in what way the equity can be satisfied . Scarman LJ 's reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutionally parsimonious , but it does implicitly recognise that the court must also do justice to the defendant . 49 . It is no coincidence that these statements of principle refer to satisfying the equity ( rather than satisfying , or vindicating , the claimant 's expectations ) . The equity arises not from the claimant 's expectations alone , but from the combination of expectations , detrimental reliance , and the unconscionableness of allowing the benefactor ( or the deceased benefactor 's estate ) to go back on the assurances . There is a faint parallel with the old equitable doctrine of part performance , of which Lord Selborne said in ' ' Maddison v Alderson ' ' ( 1883 ) 8 App Cas 467 , 475 , In a suit founded on such part performance , the defendant is really ' charged ' upon the equities resulting from the acts done in execution of the contract , and not ( within the meaning of the statute ) upon the contract itself . So with proprietary estoppel the defendant is charged with satisfying the equity which has arisen from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint since in the case of estoppel there is no contract and the nexus between the benefactor 's assurances and the resulting equity is less direct ; the assurances are only half the story . In ' ' Dillwyn v Llewelyn ' ' ( 1862 ) 4 De G F &amp; J 517 , 522 Lord Westbury expressed the point in terms which anticipated Lord Selborne : The equity of the donee and the estate to be claimed by virtue of it depend on the transaction , that is , on the acts done , and not on the language of the memorandum which amounted to an imperfect gift . 50 . To recapitulate : there is a category of case in which the benefactor and the claimant have reached a mutual understanding which is in reasonably clear terms but does not amount to a contract . I have already referred to the typical case of a carer who has the expectation of coming into the benefactor 's house , either outright or for life . In such a case the court 's natural response is to fulfil the claimant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or extravagant , or out of all proportion to the detriment which the claimant has suffered , the court can and should recognise that the claimant 's equity should be satisfied in another ( and generally more limited ) way . 51 . But that does not mean that the court should in such a case abandon expectations completely , and look to the detriment suffered by the claimant as defining the appropriate measure of relief . Indeed in many cases the detriment may be even more difficult to quantify , in financial terms , than the claimant 's expectations . Detriment can be quantified with reasonable precision if it consists solely of expenditure on improvements to another person 's house , and in some cases of that sort an equitable charge for the expenditure may be sufficient to satisfy the equity ( see Snell 's Equity 30th ed para 39-21 and the authorities mentioned in that paragraph ) . But the detriment of an ever- increasing burden of care for an elderly person , and of having to be subservient to his or her moods and wishes , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimant may not be motivated solely by reliance on the benefactor 's assurances , and may receive some countervailing benefits ( such as free bed and board ) . In such circumstances the court has to exercise a wide judgmental discretion . 52 . It would be unwise to attempt any comprehensive enumeration of the factors relevant to the exercise of the court 's discretion , or to suggest any hierarchy of factors . In my view they include , but are not limited to , the factors mentioned in Dr Gardner 's third hypothesis ( misconduct of the claimant as in ' ' J Willis &amp; Sons v Willis ' ' 1979 Ch 261 or particularly oppressive conduct on the part of the defendant , as in ' ' Crabb v Arun District Council ' ' or ' ' Pascoe v Turner ' ' 1979 1 WLR 431 ) . To these can safely be added the court 's recognition that it can not compel people who have fallen out to live peaceably together , so that there may be a need for a clean break ; alterations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's assurances have been given , and the claimant 's detriment has been suffered , over a long period of years ; the likely effect of taxation ; and ( to a limited degree ) the other claims ( legal or moral ) on the benefactor or his or her estate . No doubt there are many other factors which it may be right for the court to take into account in particular factual situations . 53 . The judge did in this case consider , although not in detail , what Mr Jennings might reasonably have earned in the way of arm 's length remuneration for his services . He also considered what professional nursing care might have cost during the last eight years of Mrs Royle 's life . A detailed computational approach was adopted ( but with a different outcome , limited to compensation of reliance loss ) by the Supreme Court of Tasmania in ' ' Public Trustee v Wadley ' ' 1997 7 Tas . LR 35 in which the court discussed the appropriate hourly rate and the total number of hours of housework undertaken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissenting judgment of Wright J ) had subordinated her own life to that of her father and whose attentive and affectionate service , often no doubt at considerable inconvenience to herself , put her assistance on a higher plane than that of a domestic servant . 54 . That illustrates the Australian preference for compensating the reliance loss only . Under English law that approach may sometimes be appropriate ( see paragraph 51 above ) but only where , on the facts , a higher measure would amount to overcompensation . In my view it would rarely if ever be appropriate to go into detailed inquiries as to hours and hourly rates where the claim was based on proprietary estoppel ( rather than a restitutionary claim for services which were not gratuitous ) . But the going rate for live-in carers can provide a useful cross-check in the exercise of the court 's discretion . 55 . I have made some references to the general trend of Australian jurisprudence in this area . It is unnecessary to attempt any detailed study of the different views expressed by the High Court in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very different context of litigation arising out of personal injuries suffered in a collision between two warships ) or of Australian cases since then . 56 . However I respectfully agree with the view expressed by Hobhouse LJ in ' ' Sledmore v Dalby ' ' ( 1996 ) 72 P&amp;CR 196 , that the principle of proportionality ( between remedy and detriment ) , emphasised by Mason CJ in Verwayen , is relevant in England also . As Hobhouse LJ observed at p.209 , to recognise the need for proportionality .. is to say little more than that the end result must be a just one having regard to the assumption made by the party asserting the estoppel and the detriment which he has experienced . The essence of the doctrine of proprietary estoppel is to do what is necessary to avoid an unconscionable result , and a disproportionate remedy can not be the right way of going about that . Cases on interim injunctive relief have recognised the importance of proportionality in the granting of equitable remedies : see for instance ' ' Lock International v Beswick ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court is granting final relief after investigating all the facts proportionality is even more important . 57 . I do not consider that the judge made any error of law in his approach to the exercise of his discretion , or that it was otherwise flawed . He did make an error in his reference to the quantum of the relief granted in Gillett v Holt ( the claimant was awarded a farmhouse and 42 hectares of land as well as 100,000 ) . But every case depends on its own facts and that slip can not in my view have played a significant part in the judge 's disposal of the case . 58 . I would therefore dismiss this appeal . 
487514 Neuropathy target esterase also known as patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 6 ( PNPLA6 ) is a neuropathy target esterase enzyme that in humans is encoded by the ' ' PNPLA6 ' ' gene . Neuropathy target esterase is a phospholipase that deacetylates intracellular phosphatidylcholine to produce glycerophosphocholine . It is thought to function in neurite outgrowth and process elongation during neuronal differentiation . The protein is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum in both neurons and non-neuronal cells . # Function # Neuropathy target esterase is an enzyme with phospholipase B activity : It sequentially hydrolyses both fatty acids from the major membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine , which generates water-soluble glycerophosphocholine . In cells of eukaryotes from yeast to humans , NTE is anchored to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is particularly abundant in neurons , the placenta , and the kidney . Loss of NTE activity results in abnormally elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine in brain and impairment of the constitutive secretory pathway in neurons . In kidney , the expression of neuropathy target esterase is regulated by TonEBP as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinical significance # Mutations in this gene result in autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia , and the protein is the target for neurodegeneration induced by organophosphorus compounds and chemical warfare agents . Recessively-inherited mutations in ' ' NTE ' ' that substantially reduce its catalytic activity cause a rare form of hereditary spastic paraplegia ( SPG39 ) , in which distal parts of long spinal axons degenerate leading to limb weakness and paralysis . Organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy a paralysing syndrome with distal degeneration of long axons results from poisoning with neuropathic organophosphorus compounds that irreversibly inhibit NTE. 
494514 Organocerium compounds are chemical compounds that contain one or more chemical bond between carbon and cerium . Organocerium chemistry is the corresponding science exploring properties , structure and reactivity of these compounds . In general , organocerium compounds are not isolable , and are rather studied in solution via their reactions with other species . There are notable exceptions , such as the Cp* <sub> 3 </sub> Ce(III) complex shown at right , but they are relatively rare . Complexes involving cerium of various oxidation states are known : though lanthanides are most stable in the +3 state , complexes of cerium(IV) have been reported . These latter compounds have found less widespread use due to their oxidizing nature , and the majority of literature regarding organometallic cerium complexes involves the +3 oxidation state . In particular , organocerium compounds have been developed extensively as non-basic carbon nucleophiles in organic synthesis . Because cerium is relatively non-toxic , they serve as an environmentally friendly alternative to other organometallic reagents . Several reviews detailing these applications have been published . # Structure # The solution structure of organocerium reagents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily on the manner in which it is prepared . In particular , those derived from organolithium reagents likely are believed to form something similar to a ' true ' organocerium structure , R-CeCl <sub> 2 </sub> , while those derived from Grignard reagents are more appropriately characterized as -ate complexes of the form R-MgXCeCl <sub> 3 </sub> . Furthermore , the solvent seems to alter the solution structure of the complex , with differences noted between reagents prepared in diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran . There is evidence that the parent chloride forms a polymeric species in THF solution , of the form Ce(-Cl) <sub> 2 </sub> ( H <sub> 2 </sub> O ) ( THF ) <sub> 2 </sub> <sub> n </sub> , but whether this type of polymer exists once the organometallic reagent is formed is unknown . # Preparation # Organocerium compounds are typically prepared via transmetallation from the respective organolithium or Grignard reagent . The most common cerium source for this purpose is cerium ( III ) chloride , which can be obtained in anhydrous form via dehydration of the commercially available heptahydrate . Precomplexation with tetrahydrofuran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with most procedures involving vigorous stirring for a period of no less than 2 hours . Reagents derived from alkyl , alkynyl , and alkenyl organometallic reagents as well as cerium enolates have been described . The stability of each is approximately the same regardless of origin ( i.e. lithiate or Grignard ) , with the exception of alkenyl reagents , which tend to be more stable when derived from the corresponding lithiate . The reasons for this are still poorly understood . Functional groups compatible with the parent organometallic compound are generally also stable upon transmetallation to cerium . The figure below summarizes the kinds of organocerium compounds that have been prepared , highlighting several of the more ' exotic ' species reported in the literature . # Reactions # Organocerium reagents are used almost exclusively for addition reactions in the same vein as organolithium and Grignard reagents . To this end , they have a number of particularly useful characteristics that distinguish them from their more common counterparts . They are incredibly nucleophilic , allowing additions to imines in the absence of additional Lewis acid catalysts , making them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this high reactivity , organocerium reagents are almost entirely non-basic , tolerating the presence of free alcohols and amines as well as enolizable -protons . The oxophilicity of cerium imparts strong 1,2-selectivity in reactions with conjugated electrophiles similarly to organolithium reagents . At the same time , organocerium reagents can be used to synthesize ketones from acyl compounds without over-addition , as seen with organocuprates . This dichotomy illustrates the unique reactivity of organolanthanide reagents . Finally , organocerium reagents have been employed in a number of total syntheses . Shown below is a key coupling step in the total synthesis of roseophilin , a potent antitumor antibiotic .

598514 The Dedication of the Basilicas of the Apostles Peter and Paul is a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church , which is celebrated on 18 November . This feast combines the standard celebration of the dedication of a church for St. Peter 's Basilica and the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls , which were both built by the Emperor Constantine the Great during the 4th century . These sites had already been visited by pilgrims for over a century when the basilicas were built to honor the apostles traditionally believed to have been buried there . The basilicas were originally joined by a colonnade , which was built despite the distance of several miles between them . Their significance in the Catholic Church is emphasized in the reference made to them in the obligation on Catholic bishops to make a ' ' Quinquennial visit ad limina ' ' in which they are required to go to the tombs of the Apostles in Rome every five years to report on the status of their dioceses or prelatures . This requirement was initially set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papal bull ' ' Romanus Pontifex ' ' , which established the norms for these visits . On 31 December 1909 , Pope Pius X decreed that a bishop needs to report to the pope an account of the state of his diocese once every five years , starting in 1911.

621514 The Ritz Theater is located in the city of Newburgh , New York . The theater is the last remaining historic theater in the city . The legendary building has a rich history of notable performances , and is being restored by a local nonprofit organization . # History # The original structure that would become the home of the Ritz Theater was constructed in 1883 at 107 Broadway in Newburgh , New York . The address had been the site of other ventures that offered some of lifes small luxuries : George Barnes plumbing business .. a cigar factory .. and even a champagne factory. # 1900s # In 1913 , the intended manufacturing building was purchased by George Cohen , a Poughkeepsie entrepreneur , and was named Cohens Opera House . The opera house opened on February 4 , 1913 . The opera house welcomed performers of all arts : jugglers , singers , dance troupes , theater companies , etc . The East-West Theater Company became a part of the theater and changed the theaters name from Cohens Opera House to the State Theater in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vaudeville theatrical genre that was extremely popular at the time . In 1933 Eugene Levy purchased the theater from George Cohen and converted that playhouse of a gaudier era into an institution where cinematic and variety productions of the highest standard were presented with amazing skill , and affording the fascinated beholder the ultimate in comfort and convenience . This would begin a new era for the Ritz Theater , which became a frequent stomping ground of many big name stars such as : Ella Fitzgerald , Louis Prima , Mary Martin , Peggy Lee , Wood Herman , Dick Powell , Bill Bojangles Robinson , Eddy Duchin , Red Skeleton , Xavier Cugat , The Inkspots , Vaughn Monroe , Montana Slim , Les Brown , Ricardo Crotez , and many more . On November 3 , 1940 , Frank Sinatra , an unknown singer at the time , stepped onto the Ritz Theaters stage . The band of Tommy Dorsey backed Sinatra who captivated the Newburgh audience .

It was on the Ritz stage that they planted the seeds for their sitcom , ' ' I Love Lucy ' ' . Shows were brought to the Ritz Theater by New York Citys Paramount Theater to test their acts on the Newburgh audience before opening in New York City . Although the Ritz Theater continued to show movies , in the 1960s both the City of Newburgh and its once highly popular street of Broadway entered a slow decline that affected the theater as well as the city . The popular city of Newburgh was no longer as frequented as it once was as the ferry closed , and I-84 as well as the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge by-passed the downtown area of Newburgh . In October 1969 , the Ritz Theater was closed , and the theater became a movie house containing two cinemas . Cinemas one and two were carved into the house and the stage was closed and walled off from the rest of the structure . In 1981 both of the cinemas were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the theater and the owner of cinemas One and Two , Abram and Eva Levinson , quit Newburgh .. quietly closing up shop . In February 1999 , the movie theater was reopened by a former owner ; however , the theater was quickly closed again for good in June of the same year due to lack of business . Throughout this span of seventeen weeks in business , the theater only had 700 customers . # 2000s # In 2002 , the Ritz Theater was purchased by Patricia Haggerty-Wenz , Founder and Executive Director of Safe Harbors of the Hudson , which is a nonprofit organization that is committed to transforming lives and building communities through housing and the arts in the City of Newburgh . The organization stumbled upon the theater in the process of restoring the adjacent former Hotel Newburgh , which is now the Cornerstone Residence , a supportive-housing facility . Haggerty-Wenz 's mission for the only remaining historic theater in the City of Newburgh , is to provide a venue for live performances in a city that has none , educational programs for our youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active cultural and tourist destination . This combination project , according to Haggerty-Wenz , is the only one in the country that combines the restoration of a historic theater with a supportive housing project , all under one roof . With Haggerty-Wenz and Safe Harbors of the Hudson being the new owner of the establishment , the renovation of the Ritz Theater Lobby began . The renovation of the supportive housing project called the Cornerstone Residence adjacent to the theater occurred from 2004-2006 . The Cornerstone Residence consists of 128 apartments ; 116 are supportive housing units and twelve are artist lofts . The apartments house a mixed tenancy of single adults , including formerly homeless , veterans , those living with a mental health diagnosis and/or physical disability , artists and other adults who need safe , attractive affordable housing . In 2008 , Safe Harbors of the Hudson created a nonprofit organization called Ritz Theater-Newburgh , Inc . The mission of this particular nonprofit organization was to focus exclusively on the restoration of the Ritz Theater . A new era bloomed within the theater . It began hosting live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as : Levi Kreiss , Pete Seeger and Odair Assad . The performances were part of the Tom Humphrey Guitar series . In 2009 , Ritz Theater-Newburgh , Inc. continued providing programming and performances in the restored lobby from artists such as : Bucky Pizzarelli , Arturo OFarrill , The Michele Ramo Group , Jesse Lege , and many others . As well as providing performances in the lobby , the organization also focused on raising funds to restore the original theater to what it was . In July of the same year , Congressman Maurice Hinchey secured a federal appropriations bill which included 400,000 to begin renovating the Ritz Theater , the last remaining historic theater in Newburgh . In 2010 , the Tom Humphrey Guitar Series continued to perform featuring artists such as : Larry Coryell , Maria Zemantauski and Duke Robillard . In October and November , Cindy Cashdollar and Frederic Hand performed and the second annual RitzKidz Newburghs Got Talent Talent Show was held . In February of the same year , the Ritz Theater secured 200,000 dollars in funding from the New York State Division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was directed towards the building of a box office . # Future # The completion of the reconstruction of the Ritz Theater is proposed to be completed in 2014 . After the theater is finished , it will hold 825 people . There are a few nonprofit performing arts organizations who hope to make the newly renovated Ritz Theater their home ; such as : The Greater Newburgh Symphony Orchestra , the Opera Company of the Highlands and the Newburgh Performing Arts Academy ( Ritz Theater Tour ) .

Interpol 's report said that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laptops , although the initial Colombian security force access to the data sources ( between 1 and 3 March ) did not conform to international standards . The laptops had been booted and hard drives or USB sticks were viewed . President Hugo Chvez dismissed Interpol 's findings as A show of clowns , ridiculous given by a gringo , aggressive , corrupt and vagabond policeman , about which spending time on is not worthwhile . and threatened to revise ( again ) both its economic and diplomatic relations with Colombia . On June 15 , 2008 Interpol issued a new press release in response to a statement by Ecuador 's Foreign Ministry that Interpol considered to be incorrect . The press release stated that Ecuador inaccurately suggests that Interpol had not established whether the eight seized exhibits forensically examined by Interpol 's computer forensic experts had been recovered by Colombian authorities on 1 March 2008 from a FARC camp or belonged to Raul Reyes . In fact , based on a review of all the information and material provided by Colombia , including a classified oral briefing , Interpol was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , that the seized computer exhibits it was requested to forensically examine were taken from the FARC terrorist camp on 1 March 2008 and belonged to Raul Reyes . Interpol also added : Validating that the contents of the computer exhibits were not manipulated after their seizure by Colombian authorities is not in any way , shape or form the same as saying that the contents of the user files are true and accurate . Interpol therefore objects to those who suggest that Interpol 's report validates the source and accuracy of any particular document or user file contained therein . According to an unnamed independent German computer expert consulted by Heise Online , there would have been a possibility of introducing potentially manipulated disk images . # Colombian Supreme Court # In May 2011 the Supreme Court of Colombia dismissed a case against Congressman Wilson Borja . The case rested on material from the FARC files . The Court ruled the material inadmissible as it had not been properly acquired by the Judicial Police , with the Prosecutor General 's Office clarifying that no other power in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less when ignoring foreign authorities . The court also said that the validity of the content could not be verified , as the alleged emails had been copied into Microsoft Word documents and provided no indication of the sender or receiver . The ruling would affect a number of open cases where defendants were accused of FARC collaboration based on FARC files evidence . # Allegations # The documents contained a letter from Reyes to the high command of FARC explaining that he had recently held meetings with the Security Minister of Ecuador , Gustavo Larrea , representing President Correa , who had indicated a desire to establish formal relations with the FARC . In the letter , Reyes conveys the following information to the high command : the intention of the Ecuadorian government to replace police forces that do not accept the presence of the guerrilla organization in the area ; the request for the release of a hostage , perhaps the son of professor Moncayo or someone else who may increase political action ; and the decision of Ecuador to annul next year 's license for the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Interior Minister Fernando Bustamante dismissed these allegations as false . He stated that We are not going to accept such a thing . He added It is very easy to say something based on evidence that has not been scrutinized publicly or internationally . The next day , another set of documents , allegedly indicating a relationship between the FARC and Venezuela , was released . According to Naranjo , the documents suggested that Chvez had given the FARC guerrillas US$300 million and was assisting the organization to obtain 50 kg of uranium . scar Naranjo also said there was evidence that Hugo Chvez had received 100 million pesos when he was a jailed rebel leader . Some of the documents , along with photographs obtained from Reyes ' laptops , were passed to the press . The Vice president of Colombia , Francisco Santos , claimed at a disarmament forum in Geneva that the FARC was planning to build a dirty bomb , although he presented no evidence to back up his allegations . A message to Reyes subsequently found on one of the computers seems to indicate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A letter from the FARC supremo Manuel Marulanda to the Venezuelan President was released on March 4 . In this letter , Marulanda thanks the Venezuelan Government for its assistance in the war against the Colombian Government and the lvaro Uribe presidency which was supported by the United States . FARC also offered their modest knowledge in defense of the Bolivarian Revolution in case of a gringo aggression , understood to mean assistance against a possible military action from the United States . # Denials # Venezuelan Interior minister Ramn Rodrguez Chacn denied the accusations and stated that They say that they find in that computer a letter from Marulanda to our commander in chief . Everybody already knows ( the letters ) , the ones showed by our commander in chief . Pay attention , Venezuelan and Colombian people , how they manage the manipulation and deception , that kind of santanderist technique and now with fascism . Rodrguez Chacn also stated that months before , Venezuelan authorities had seized another computer , from the deceased narcotrafficker Wilson Varela , which in turn implicated Colombian police and General scar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and business between that general and that mafia capo to not reveal important information . Juan David Naranjo was one of his links and adjutants , brother of General scar Naranjo Trujillo. said Rodrguez Chacn . He added that he had not previously made the documents public because of ethics . The affair that involved General Naranjo 's brother in drug trafficking had been widely known since May 2006 , when Naranjo himself announced it to the press . The Colombian government stated that it would present the documents to the Organization of American States ( OAS ) to demonstrate that Venezuela and Ecuador were supporting the FARC , and thereby violating international law against the harboring of terrorists . President Uribe stated that our UN ambassador will announce that Colombia intends to denounce Hugo Chvez , President of Venezuela to the International Criminal Court , for sponsoring and financing people that commit genocide . On March 3 , Ecuadorian security minister Gustavo Larrea admitted having met with FARC , without specifying where . Later that day , Ecuador 's government announced it was in very advanced talks with FARC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to President Rafael Correa , the effort was thwarted by Colombia 's military operation . The Colombian government rejected this argument , insisting that the captured computer documents revealed Ecuador to be engaging in hostage trafficking for political means and political gain , by suggesting that it would rotate military personnel on the border in order to allow the FARC to operate more freely . # Newspaper revelations # On March 4 , the Colombian newsweekly ' ' Revista Semana ' ' published the second of two special editions following the death of FARC 's Ral Reyes , presenting some of the documents said to have been found on the computers seized by the Colombian government . The documents included several letters between FARC commanders and the Secretariat . On September 22 , 2007 , a clandestine meeting had been held between a member or a emissary of the Secretariat and the President of Venezuela in Caracas , as inferred from a letter from JE to the Secretariat . On April 8 , 2007 , a Daniel writes in a letter to members of the Secretariat Joaqun Gmez and Fabin Ramrez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chupeta , a man with high acquisitive power to carry out an exchange of FARC drugs for missiles . According to this document , Chupeta has contacts in Lebanon and his organization can handle the transport in two ways : via Europe or via Mexico . On October 4 , 2007 , Ivn Mrquez writes of a meeting with Rodrguez Chacn in which is discussed a meeting of Commanders in Venezuela ( Fuerte Tiuna in Caracas , Valencia , Barinas or Trujillo ) , with security dealt with by Venezuelan military forces and organised by Rodrguez Chacn , an expert on this kind of issues . If it takes place , President Chvez will be accompanied by Presidents Ortega , Morales and Correa , which are patria o muerte . This meeting between Chvez and Marulanda became an issue following publication of these documents . On October 8 , 2007 , details about secret meetings between Rodrguez Chacn and the FARC were recorded , dealing with a request for proof that Ingrid Betancourt was still alive . He would be thankful if we send a record with the voice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Piedad . A document dated December 23 , 2007 discusses the procedure for the release of two hostages in February 2008 . It also refers to a request from the French President Nicolas Sarkozy to Chvez , asking Marulanda to receive his emissary Noe , whom FARC believes to be a French intelligence agent . Chvez asks for the release of Ingrid Betancourt , to which FARC responds : we ( FARC ) said that if we release her , we would run out of cards . A document dated January 18 , 2008 , records a meeting with Ecuadorian Security Minister Gustavo Larrea and a request for the release of Gustavo Moncayo 's son . On February 8 , 2008 , a message from Ivn and Ricardo to Comrade Manuel and the Secretariat , tells of a meeting with ngel who had read a letter from Manuel and would send a reply , adding that he ( ngel ) has already readied the first 50 and has a time frame for completing up to 200 during the year . The letter goes on to mention possible business deals regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gasoline in Colombia , as well as taking from the dossier , the creation of a profitable investment company in Venezuela . The document also mentions that President Chvez is willing to receive 47 guerrilla prisoners and 500 jailed guerrillas in his territory , and that he plans to create a sort of Contadora Group , seeking to promote peace negotiations and the recognition of the FARC as a belligerent force . If they agree to his proposal , Chvez says that it would help to lessen the impact from a manipulated march against the FARC , and that he would be willing to promote counter-marches for peace and the Humanitarian Exchange in several countries . A document dated February 16 , 2008 , mentions a deal involving 50 kg of uranium , which was going to be sold at 2.5 million USD per kilogram . # Wider repercussions # On March 6 , 2008 Viktor Bout , an ex-KGB agent turned weapons dealer , was arrested in a luxury hotel in Thailand during a raid staged by US DEA agents and carried out by Thai police forces . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Middle East and to the Colombian terrorist group FARC . Sources in Spain claimed that his arrest was made possible by information found on the captured computers , but this was contradicted by sources in Colombia . The data found on the laptop computers included personal pictures of Raul Reyes and the guerrilla camp which was bombed in the attack . According to Colombian officials , this information not only corroborated some of their previous suspicions but also led to several important discoveries about FARC 's inner activities and their entire international network . The information uncovered the way in which the FARC leadership was involved in several criminal dealings , including the deaths in captivity of the 11 Norte del Valle deputies , as well as ties with notable drug dealers and Colombian politicians . It led to the discovery of FARC funds related to Rodrigo Granda hidden in Costa Rica and to the capture of Rosario Garca Albert , a Spanish woman who was believed to be the representative of the guerrilla group in Spain and Portugal . On March 25 , 2008 , Colombian intelligence officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials , corroborated the alleged deal mentioned on Reyes ' captured computers . Some important Colombian figures , including Liberal opposition senator Piedad Cordoba , faced prosecution by the authorities in 2008 for incriminating emails found on these laptops . A Chilean government official offered his resignation after being tied with some of the documents found on these computers . The information that was uncovered related to the inner workings of the organization , its structure and channels of communication and was used to give the FARC its biggest blow , in an intelligence operation which led to the liberation of Ingrid Betancourt and three American contractors in July 2008 . During the diplomatic crisis caused by the 2008 unrest in Bolivia , the United States government froze the assets of several senior members of the Venezuelan Government : ex-Interior Minister Ramn Rodrguez Chacn , senior DISIP director Henry de Jess Rangel and military intelligence chief Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios , accusing them of arming , supporting and financing the FARC and their killing of innocents , according to information discovered on Reyes ' computers .

The election to the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly was held in seven phases from 8 February through 3 March 2012 . Uttar Pradesh has the world 's largest population for a sub-national democracy . The incumbent chief minister Mayawati 's Bahujan Samaj Party party , which previously won an absolute majority of seats , was defeated by Mulayam Singh Yadav 's Samajwadi Party , which gained an absolute majority in the election . Mulayam 's son and U.P . party president Akhilesh Yadav was nominated as chief minister by the party . # Background # Uttar Pradesh is the largest province in India in terms of population , but the fifth largest in terms of landmass after the bifurcation to create Uttarakhand . It is also considered politically important because of the number of seats it returns to the ' ' Lok Sabha ' ' and as including the constituencies of such nationally notable figures as Maneka Gandhi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nehru-Gandhi family dynasty . It was also previously the home of Prime Ministers Atal Behari Vajpayee and Indira Gandhi . The legislative assembly has 403 seats , 206 of which were won by the BSP in the previous election . # Schedule # The ECI announced on 24 December 2011 that the election will occur in seven phases on 8 , 11 , 15 , 19 , 23 , 28 February and 3 March . The result will be announced on 6 March . On 9 January , the Election Commission had announced that the original date of 4 February for the first phase had been changed to 3 March , while vote counting had moved from 4 March to 6 March due to celebrations for ' ' Barawafat ' ' , for which an Election Commission official said that : There were concerns people would not be able to come out to exercise their franchise . # Parties # A total of 223 parties vied for the 403 seats in the legislative assembly . This was an increase compared to the previous election which featured 131 parties who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were : * Samajwadi Party ( SP ) ( contested 397 seats ) * Bahujan Samajwadi Party ( BSP ) ( ' ' incumbent ' ' ) ( contested 403 seats ) * Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) * Indian National Congress ( INC ) ( pre-election alliance with RLD ) * Rashtriya Lok Dal ( RLD ) ( pre-election alliance with INC ) * Rashtriya Parivartan Dal * Akhil Bhartiya Loktantrik Congress * United Democratic Front * Jan Morcha * Rashtriya Swabhimaan Party * Peace party of India * Apna Dal * Quami Ekta Dal * JD(U) * All India Trinamool Congress * Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) * Communist Party of India # 2010 issues # In 2010 , INC General Secretary Rahul Gandhi was arrested , along with , while he was staging a sit-in in Bhatta Parsaul village in support of farmers agitating against inadequate compensation for the acquisition of their land for a highway project . Though he was released after three hours , INC party members in other parts of the country such as Mumbai 's western suburbs of Santacruz , Malad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said : I have seen the violence unleashed on your youth and women . By seeing what has happened here , I feel ashamed to be an Indian . The state government is tormenting its own people . Though INC party spokesman Subodh Srivastava said that several party leaders and workers were injured in the ' ' lathicharge ' ' by police at a number of places in the state ( ' ' sic ' ' ) during peaceful protest and demonstration . ( ' ' sic ' ' ) More than 10,000 workers and leaders were arrested across the state , the UP government said that there was no impact as a result of the INC agitation and that only 135 people had been arrested in apprehension of breach of peace during the ensuing ' ' chakka jam ' ' in protest against Gandhi 's arrest . Mayawati responded also to the Gandhi agitation by saying : I would like to tell ' ' Yuvraj ' ' that whatever struggle he has to do , he should do in his home first , as the decision is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being heard in his own home and he is venting his frustration by indulging in mean dramatics . The same day his mother , Sonia Gandhi , visited her national constituency of Rae Bareli to review the implementation of such nationally sponsored rural employment and housing schemes as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act where she called for better implementation of the various schemes such as to ensure that 100 days of employment would be provided to a maximum number of families . Under the pretext of land acquisition , the action was read as having gathered pace as after other legislative elections . The ' ' Times of India ' ' read the move as a bigger favour from jittery chief minister Mayawati and that the subsequent free-for-all included INC staging anti-Mayawati protests as well as BJP leaders trying not to be undone by also courting trouble on the basis of land-related strife everywhere ... giving politicians scope for photo ops . It also said that Mayawati may have had a point in lobbing the land acquisition ball back into the Centre 's ( national government ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only make her opponents look good for being martyred ; while it still question if the INC were genuinely friends of farmers , tribals , ' ' Dalits ' ' , et al . # Corruption issues # A Centre for Media Studies report showed that the corruption has increased in UP . The Central Bureau of Investigation said there was strong evidence against incumbent Chief Minister Mayawati in a case about disproportionate assets for a public figure ; while Samajwadi party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav also has a case pending against him in a similar case . Out of a total of 403 MLAs , 143 face criminal charges . The Chief Election Commissioner has raised concerns about the use of money in the election for some form of undue campaigning . After the EC imposed restrictions on the movement of unaccounted money , police checks across UP netted over 12 crores in cash , several kilogrammes of silver and weapons , leading to the arrest of at least one person . The Uttar Pradesh government was also sent a notice by the national government for alleged corruption in MGNREGA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She has also been accused by former minister Avdesh Verma of selling party tickets in the election for Rs. 4 crores . Furthermore , the BSP also expelled Badshah Singh and Babu Singh Kushwaha , who had been removed after CBI evidence of corruption , from the party on charges of corruption . During the tenure of the incumbent CM Mayawati , opposition parties have accused her of constructing parks and statues of herself and other ' ' dalit ' ' icons such as Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram in places such as Noida and Lucknow that cost the exchequer crores of rupees in the name of development and social upliftment for ' ' dalit ' ' s . The Uttar Pradesh government was also criticised by the Supreme Court for not halting the construction of the memorials . despite an order to do so . On 7 January the Chief Election Commissioner S. Y. Quraishi ordered for the veiling of statues of all political figures except for Mohandas Gandhi , as well as veiling the BSP 's symbol the elephant , in order to have a level playing field by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Gautam Budh Nagar , though Chief Electoral Officer Umesh Sinha said the deadline was 15 January but the government should try and do so earlier in view of the implementation of code of conduct . However , in Lucknow BSP activists were reported to have removed the a veil minutes after it had been installed . The BSP called the move as completely wrong and not justified . Quraishi dismissed criticism of the order as ill-informed and add that he was surprised the order has been taken as something unusual . There is a model code of conduct which says there should be a level-playing field for all candidates and parties . On 9 January , social activist Dheeraj Singh filed a PIL in the Allahabad High Court challenging the EC 's order on the grounds that the elephants represent Ganesha and veiling them could hurt public sentiment . On 11 January the High Court dismissed the petition as withdrawn on technical grounds . # Campaign # The INC 's Rahul Gandhi started his campaign on 14 November 2011 before the announcement of the election phases , while Mulayam Singh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ruling BSP for corruption and atrocities on people . Rahul Gandhi toured one of the most impoverished area of the country on 17 January , Bundelkhand in Lalitpur . He also visited Mauranipur , Chirgaon , Jhansi and Mahoba , where he was reportedly shown black flags over the issue of black money . He promised to bring change , while also questioning the BSP government 's alleged corruption in the MGNREGA scheme . Prime Minister Manmohan Singh addressed a rally in Kanpur on 17 February where he alleged that the U.P . government is not cooperating with the national government in regards to infrastructure development despite receiving five times the funds demanded . He also criticised the incumbent government 's alleged corruption and U.P . ' s infrastructure woes . The reason behind this bad situation is that non- Congress governments which came to power in the state in the last 22 years did not pay attention either to governance or the problems of the common man . The Congress will win UP elections . Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi will ensure Congress ' victory in UP ... we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Congress comes to power . There is a need to change this situation . You need a government which changes the shape of UP and focuses on development by rising above caste and religious lines . Congress led by Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi can provide such a government . The INC also got the endorsement of the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind . After the first three phases of voting the party was said to have been cautious about its expectations of winning the election . The BJP formally began its campaign on 10 January , but would start hosting public meeting 10 days later . Party leaders from outside UP had been called in to campaign , though many refused to show support for candidates with corruption allegations . These included former PM Atal Behari Vajpayee , Gujarat CM Narendra Modi , former PM-candidate and Home Minister MP Lal Krishna Advani , MP Sushma Swaraj , former Law Minister MP Arun Jaitley .

Incumbent CM Mayawati began her campaign on 27 January at a rally in Bijnor . On 15 January , she released the BSP 's list of candidates for all the 403 constituencies . The list included 88 candidates belonging to SCs , 113 from OBCs , 85 religious minorities and 117 upper castes , out of which 74 are Brahmins . On 20 January , the Samajwadi Party released its electoral manifesto in Lucknow which included promising reservation for the minorities , a ban on land acquisition and loans of four percent interest to small farmers . Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav got an endorsement from the Shahi Imam of New Delhi 's Jama Masjid Syed Ahmed Bukhari , who had appealed to Muslim voters to vote for the SP and alleged that the INC had regressed UP 's fortunes . The anti-corruption group Team Anna also decided to campaign in four of the five provinces that are holding ' ' Vidhan Sabha ' ' elections , except Manipur ; however they said that they would not do so in favour of or against any particular party . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Controversies # The Supreme Court also criticised the UP government for the Land Acquisition Act calling it an engine of oppression for the government 's low cost acquisition without adequate redress for the villagers , who were then beaten by police . It said that the policy as anti-poor and against the interests of the common man , while citing that after its inception in 1894 it had to be immediately amended . At the same time , INC General Secretary Rahul Gandhi toured two villages to start an agitation march against such acquisitions On 22 December 2011 the national government announced a four and half percent sub-quota for backward Muslims as part of an expanded definition of Other Backward Castes in the civil service and at educational institutions , which came into effect on 1 January . BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley strongly objected to the proposal on the grounds that it was unconstitutional with the purpose of campaigning to wooing Muslim voters in the election . On 10 January , Minority Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid was sent a notice by the ECI on a complaint filed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khurshid had said that if the INC was victorious in the election , it would double the quota for Muslims to nine percent . He then reiterated that the comments was a promise not an allurement .

The ECI replaced the UP DGP Brij Lal and Home Secretary Fateh Bahadur on 8 January after complaints from other parties that they were partisan on the issue of covering the statues . On 22 January , the ECI decided to ban exit polls from 28 January to 3 March . Opinion polls were also banned 48 hours prior to the voting of each phase in the electronic media , however there was no such restriction on the print media . # Individual candidates # After being fired from the BSP for corruption , Babu Singh Kushwaha , Badshah Singh and Awdhesh Verma joined the BJP .

771514 The 2011 Manhattan terrorism plot was alleged to be an alleged conspiracy by two Muslim Arab-Americans to bomb various targets in the Manhattan borough of New York City , New York , USA . It was alleged that they planned to attack an unspecified synagogue and one of them expressed interest in blowing up a church and the Empire State Building . New York City law enforcement arrested the two suspects , 26-year-old Ahmed Ferhani and 20-year-old Mohamed Mamdouh , in a sting operation on May 11 , 2011 . Their plot was motivated primarily by politics and anti-Semitism , according to the authorities . # Plot # On May 12 , 2011 , New York City law enforcement officials announced that two suspects , Ahmed Ferhani and Mohamed Mamdouh , had been arrested for allegedly trying to purchase weapons , including three pistols and hand grenades , as part of a terror plot to attack an unspecified Manhattan synagogue . New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said both suspects wanted to attack a major synagogue . Mr. Ferhani is alleged to also have expressed an interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building . Prior to their arrest , the two men had already obtained some guns . Ferhani allegedly was trying to sell drugs to fund the attacks . According to law enforcement officials , this was the thirteenth plot thwarted against the city since the September 11 attacks . # Arrest # An undercover detective had been investigating one of the suspects , Ahmed Ferhani , for several months . In October 2010 , Ferhani was arrested on a robbery charge in Manhattan , when the detective overhead Ferhani saying he hated Jews and was upset with the way Muslims , especially Palestinians , were treated around the world . According to New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly , Ferhani once said , They 're treating us like dogs . Ferhani also told the detective about his intent to participate in jihad and that he would become a martyr . Eventually Ferhani brought Mamdouh into the plot , who prosecutors said is on tape saying he hated Jews . According to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance , the authorities decided to act because Ferhani 's plans became bigger and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undercover detective , Ferhani discussed the idea of attacking a synagogue , even suggesting disguising himself as a worshiping Jew so he could infiltrate the synagogue and leave a bomb inside . On May 11 , 2011 , the NYPD set up an arms deal as a sting operation on Manhattan 's West Side . In the deal , one of the undercover officers handed Ferhani a bag containing three handguns , three boxes of ammo and an inert ( not operational ) grenade . Once Ferhani placed the bag in the trunk of his car , the police swarmed and arrested him , as well as Mamdouh , who was nearby . As soon as Ferhani put the bag into the trunk of a car , he was arrested , the complaint said . Mamdouh , who had been dropped off nearby before the buy , was arrested soon afterward. # Trial # On the evening of May 12 , 2011 , the two suspects were arraigned in a Manhattan courtroom on terrorism charges . Prosecutor Margaret Gandy listed the charges and evidence , and the two were detained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal ' ' , The arrests mark the first time New York state terrorism charges , rather than federal , will be used against individuals suspected in a terror plot . According to a source quoted by ' ' The Wall Street Journal ' ' , NYPD detectives brought the case to the Joint Terrorism Task Force , which decided not to take part due to concerns that the case was not strong enough to secure a conviction . A New York State grand jury decided to indict the suspects on lesser charges , and declined to indict them on the more serious charges such as second-degree conspiracy . At trial in March 2012 , one of Ferhani 's attorneys , Elizabeth Fink , argued that he had been entrapped by law enforcement authorities . In a December 2012 plea bargain , Ferhani pled guilty to terrorism conspiracy and terrorism-related weapons possession charges . He was later sentenced to ten years in prison . # Suspects # The two suspects , 26-year-old Ahmed Ferhani and 20-year-old Mohamed Mamdouh , are both Arab-Muslim immigrants from North Africa that live in East Elmhurst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot , is from Algeria , from where he and his parents were granted asylum some 10 years prior . He was under review for possible deportation for failing to show up at immigration hearings where he would have been questioned about his arrest record . Mamdouh , the accomplice , is a U.S. citizen from Morocco . At the time of attack , Ferhani was unemployed but previously worked as a cosmetic sales clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan . According to one his friends and former co-worker at Saks , he had dreams of being a model or actor and moving out to California . The friend also said Ferhani was not particularly religious , drank alcohol and was an aspiring hip-hop performer . Ferhani also had been arrested six times previously , including an October 2010 robbery of a prostitute . All the cases were eventually dismissed and sealed . # Motive # A high-ranking NYPD terrorism official said that Ferhani and Mamdouh represented a new kind of threat : They were n't waiting for guidance from Osama bin Laden , they were n't looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves .

This makes it possible for every nation to have a minimum of two representatives in the sport . The qualifying time standards may be obtained in various meets during the qualifying period that have the approval of the IAAF . All approved outdoor meets and indoor meets with the exception of 100 m , 200 m and 110/100 m hurdles races are eligible .

In addition to the qualifying standards below , marathon runners finishing in the top 20 of the 2011 World Championships or in the top 10 of any IAAF gold series marathon within the qualification period are also treated as having earned the A standard . The NOCs were still allowed to select participants using their own rules , on the condition all athletes have made the qualifying time . For example , the United States selected athletes based on the result of the 2012 United States Olympic Trials event . Sweden only entered athletes good enough to reach at least 8th position , based on an assessment by the Swedish NOC .

998514 The transalpine campaigns of the Old Swiss Confederacy , known as ' ' Ennetbirgische Feldzge ' ' transmontane campaigns in Swiss historiography , were military expeditions which resulted in the conquest of territories south of the Alps , corresponding more or less to the modern canton of Ticino , on the part of the Old Swiss Confederacy . These territories were known as ' ' ennetbirgische Vogteien ' ' or transmontane bailiwicks . The Leventina was the first transalpine possession of the Swiss cantons of Uri and Obwalden , acquired in 1403 . Other territories were acquired in 1418 and 1419 . A first setback came with the Battle of Arbedo in 1422 , where the Swiss were defeated by the Duchy of Milan , and in a treaty of 1426 , the border of the duchy was moved back to the Gotthard Pass . Renewed campaigns took place in 1439 , 1441 and 1447 , until in 1449 the Swiss were beaten again by troops of the Golden Ambrosian Republic in the Battle of Castione . In 1466 , the duke of Milan promised to grant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act on his promise , and as the Swiss were tied up in the Burgundian Wars he even formed a pact with the Burgundians . This prompted Uri to send an expedition to the Leventina , which was greeted as liberators by the local population . The Swiss tried to conquer Bellinzona as well , but after a two weeks ' siege gave up and returned home . The Battle of Giornico was for once a Swiss victory , in which a force of Uri of about 175 men , with the support of about 400 men from the local population , managed to rout a Milanese army of 10,000 . From this time , the Leventina was an undisputed possession of Uri , while Bellinzona remained under Milanese control . <BR> In 1487 , the Valais together with Lucerne wanted to expand into the Ossola . Besieging Domodossola and marauding the valleys , the Swiss were decisively defeated by the Ducal Milanese at the Battle of Crevola in April 1487 . This was the situation at the beginning of the Italian Wars in 1494 . Bellinzona was finally occupied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Louis XII of France in 1503 . The Battle of Novara ( 1513 ) was a success for the Swiss Confederacy and the allied Three Leagues which secured their possessions of Locarno , Lugano , Mendrisio , Cuvio , Travaglia , Chiavenna , Bormio , Tre pievi and Valtellina . The defeat in the Battle of Marignano ( 1515 ) set an end to Swiss aspirations to further extend their possessions , but the peace of 1516 allowed them to keep their possessions , except for Ossola which was handed back to Milan . These ' ' ennetbirgische Vogteien ' ' were governed partly by the entire confederacy , partly just by Uri , Schwyz and Nidwalden ( and the Leventina just by Uri ) throughout the early modern period . The Valtellina , governed by the Three Leagues from 1512 , was lost to Spain in the course of the ' ' Bndner Wirren ' ' , in 1639. # Transalpine bailiwicks # Overview of the transalpine bailiwicks ( , ) : Condominiums of the Forest cantons of Uri , Schwyz and Nidwalden : * Blenio 147780 and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1500 Condominiums of the Twelve Cantons ( ' ' Zwlf Orte ' ' , the Thirteen Cantons , minus Appenzell ) from 1512 : * Valmaggia * Lugano * Locarno * Mendrisio Condominiums of the Twelve Cantons from 1512 , but were lost from the Confederacy three years later and are now ' ' comuni ' ' of Lombardy and Piedmont : * Travaglia * Cuvio * Ossola ( ' ' Eschental ' ' )

4 John Finlayson or Finleyson ( 1770-1854 ) , was a disciple of Richard Brothers . Finlayson was born in Scotland in 1770 . His descendants make him the second son of Colonel John Hamilton M'Finlay , who married , about 1765 , Lady Elizabeth Mary Alexander , eldest sister of the last Earl of Stirling . He was originally a writer at Cupar , Fife , and removed thence to Edinburgh . His relations with Brothers , which began in 1797 , are detailed in the article on that enthusiast . He printed at Edinburgh a couple of pamphlets before repairing to London . In London he was ' in considerable practice as a house agent . ' Brothers led him to change the spelling of his name , by telling him his ancestors had some ' fine leys ' of land granted them for deeds of valour . Brothers , who died ( 1824 ) in Finlayson 's house at Marylebone , made it his dying charge to his friend that he should write against a rival genius , Bartholomew Prescot of Liverpool . This Finlayson did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' very correctly , as a ' misapprehended mistaken elaborate performance , or book . ' # Publications # He printed a variety of pamphlets , reiterating Brothers 's views , and developing his own peculiar notions of astronomy , for which he claimed a divine origin . The heavenly bodies were created , he thinks , partly ' to amuse us in observing them . ' The earth he decides to be a perfect sphere , ' not shaped like a garden turnip , as the Newtonians make it ; ' the sun is a created body ' very different from anything we can make here below ; ' the stars are ' oval-shaped immense masses of frozen water , with their largest ends foremost .

' # ' The Last Trumpet , ' &amp;c. , 1849 , 8vo ( incorporates No. 7 ; there are several supplements , the latest dated 21 Feb. 1850 ) .

His eldest son , Richard Brothers Finlayson , who took the name of Richard Beauford , was a photographer at Galway , where he died on 17 Dec. 1886 , aged 75. # Old age and death # Finlayson was reduced in extreme and widowed age to a parish allowance of 3s. 6d. weekly , supplemented by 5s. from Busby , in whose house Brothers had lived from 1806 to 1815 .

4 Though it is no longer practiced today , Tonga 's ancient religion was practiced for over 2000 years . Missionaries arrived and persuaded King George Tupou I to convert to Christianity ; he ordered and strictly enforced that all Tongans become Christian and no longer practice the ancient polytheistic religion with its supreme god Tangaloa. # Pulotu # Pulotu was the unseen world , the domain of the god or goddess Hikule'o believed to be reached by sea . Stories told of journeys to Pulotu . Tongans identify Pulotu with the underworld , ' ' Lolofonua ' ' . Pulotu is also identified with the cemetery or graveyard . Long ago , it was believed that Pulotu could be visited by a man to recover a dead wife . Hikule'o would assemble the spirits so the wife could be found , reanimated and released . Two entrances are pointed out by Tongans . One is ' ' Ahole ' ' a deep hole on the island of Koloa , Vava'u . Ahole was the opening from which ' ' Maui Kisikisi ' ' brought fire from the underworld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island of Tofua . There are three divisions of Pulotu called ' ' Pulotu Tete ' ' , ' ' Pulotu ' Aka'aka ' ' , and ' ' Pulotu Tu'uma'u ' ' . # Gods and deities # # Tangaloa # Tangaloa , the sky god , was regarded in Vava'u as the deity who hauled up the islands of the Vava'u group , his fish hook catching in what is now the island of ' ' Hunga ' ' . The Vava'u people attributed this great act to Tangaloa instead of Maui due to the importance of Tangaloa worship in Vava'u . ' ' Tangaloa Tufunga ' ' , though said not to be a god in Niuatoputapu , is the patron of carpenters elsewhere in Tonga . # Maui # The ' ' Maui ' ' were special men or demigods ; they appeared human .

The reaction was published about in 1971 by F. Minisci . The aromatic compound is generally electron-deficient and with N-aromatic compounds the nitrogen atom is protonated . A typical reaction is that between pyridine and pivalic acid to 2-tert-butylpyridine with silver nitrate , sulfuric acid and ammonium persulfate . The reaction resembles Friedel-Crafts alkylation but with opposite reactivity and selectivity . The Minisci reaction proceeds regioselectively and enables the introduction of a wide range of alkyl groups . A side-reaction is acylation . The ratio between alkylation and acylation depends on the substrate and the reaction conditions . Due to the simple raw materials and the simple reaction conditions the reaction has many applications in heterocyclic chemistry . # Mechanism # A free radical is formed from the carboxylic acid in an oxidative decarboxylation with silver salts and an oxidizing agent . The oxidizing agent reoxidizes the silver salt . The radical then reacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rearomatisation . The acylated product is formed from the acyl radical . # References #

4 governingbody = Private The South School is a historic school building in the village of Yellow Springs , Ohio , United States . Over its history of more than 150 years , it has served a wide range of purposes , although it is not used now as a school . Upon its completion in 1856 , the South School served one of the school districts of Miami Township . At that time , small schoolhouses covered Greene County ; more than a hundred were still in existence into the late twentieth century . This position it held only for a short time ; just two years after its completion , it was converted for use as Yellow Springs High School ; at that time , only white students were permitted to attend . After fourteen years in the South School , the high school moved to a different property ; from 1872 until 1874 , no school typically met on the property . It was reopened in the latter year to serve as the black school , which purpose it served until 1887 . Since its closure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Architecturally , the South School is a distinctive example of the Greek Revival style of architecture . Constructed on a limestone foundation , it is built of brick and covered with a metal roof . Among its most distinctive elements is the decorative brickwork that appears at certain points on the exterior ; such styling is common on buildings constructed during Yellow Springs ' golden age in the mid-19th century , but is a stark difference from the county 's other historic school buildings . Architectural historians have seen the brickwork as an indication that the school was constructed by local brickmaker and contractor J.W. Hamilton , who established his business in the community in 1848 and was an active part of the community for over thirty years . In 1984 , the South School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its important architecture and because of its place in local history . Key to its place in local history is its use as a segregated school by two races .

Brought to Brooklyn in 2011 with the Guggenheim 's support , Sanatorium is a utopian clinic of topical treatments for those inner-city afflictions we are all too familiar with : stress , loneliness and hyper-stimulation . In two-hour windows , Sanatorium visitors experience up to 3 sessions from 16 options through meetings with a series of therapists . In therapy one gets to play and consider self . The cure is in the process , powered by what the individual is willing to give and unload . All 16 treatments are based on traditional methods of expression or respected forms of perception changing programming . Balancing reality and fiction , Sanatorium draws from Gestalt psychology , theater warm-up exercises , Fluxus events , conflict resolution techniques , trust-building games , corporate coaching , psychodrama , and hypnosis . In 2012 , Sanatorium can be seen at DOCUMENTA ( 13 ) in Kassel. # # ' ' Individual Exhibitions ( selection ) ' ' # # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK **6;365796;br 2011 Babymarx .

She batted and threw right handed . After being married she played under the name of Migdalia Jinright . Born in Havana , Mickey Prez was one of the seven players born in Cuba to play the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in its twelve years history , being the others Isabel Alvarez ( 19491954 ) , Isora del Castillo ( 19491951 ) , Luisa Gallegos ( 19481949 ) , Mirtha Marrero ( 19481953 ) , Gloria Ruiz ( 19481949 ) and Zonia Vialat ( 1948 ) . The first AAGPBL spring training outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as part of a plan to create an International League of Girls Baseball . All the eight AAGPBL teams played exhibition games at Estadio Latinoamericano . On the other hand , the Brooklyn Dodgers trained in the Cuban capital because Jackie Robinson , who would be the first Afro-American to play in the Major Leagues , was training with the Dodgers for the first time . By then , city ordinances in Vero Beach , Florida , where the Dodgers normally trained , prevented blacks and whites players from competing on the same field against each other . Notably , newspaper stories from Havana indicate that the All-American girls drew larger crowds for their games than did the Dodgers . At this time , the six Cuban girls were recruited to play in the AAGPBL . That season the league made the transition from underhand to full sidearm pitching . Prez entered the league in 1948 with the Chicago Colleens , playing for them one year before joining the Springfield Sallies ( 19491950 ) , Battle Creek Belles ( 19511952 ) and Rockford Peaches ( 19521954 ) . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fastball , a curve , and a change that often had hitters way out in front , but the key was always been in control of her pitches . When the ball-strike count favored her , she was solid and concentrated better . When she was behind , she was vulnerable and created many of her own problems because she had to sacrifice some velocity for control . In addition , she was plagued by a shortage of run support for much of her career while pitching for awful teams . In 1951 , Prez posted a 1316 record and a 3.00 earned run average in 32 pitching appearances for the Belles , while leading the league in complete games ( 26 ) , innings pitched ( 237 ) and hits allowed ( 241 ) . The next season she went 1112 with a 2.34 ERA in a combined action between Battle Creek and Rockford , leading the league in games pitched ( 33 ) and ranking sixth in innings pitched ( 208 ) . Prez had mixed results in the 1953 season , going 1214 for Racine though her 2.25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also finished eight in innings pitched ( 220 ) and tied for eight in complete games ( 20 ) . Her career highlight came on August 10 of that year , when she hurled a no-hitter against the powerful Grand Rapids Chicks lineup featuring Wilma Briggs , Betty Foss , Jean Geissinger , Katie Horstman , Pepper Paire and Joanne Weaver , among others . In 1954 , during what turned out to be the final season of the league , Prez went 1111 in 24 games and ended third in innings pitched ( 164 ) , eight in complete games ( 15 ) and tenth in ERA ( 3.73 ) , while tying for sixth in wins . Prez compiled a 5770 record in 155 games , while her 2.73 career ERA ranks her twenty-second in the all-time list of AAGPBL pitchers with at least 1,000 innings of work . She also went 1-3 with a 3.00 ERA in five playoff games ( two years ) .

4 The Central Asian Orogenic Belt ( CAOB , also known as Altaids ) is one of the largest accretionary orogens on Earth and evolved over some 800 million years from the latest Mesoproterozoic to the early Triassic . It contains a record of geodynamic processes during one of the most important episodes of continental growth in Phanerozoic time . # Location # The CAOB stretches from the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean , occupying an area of about 5.3 million square kilometers , about 11% of the Asian surface area . It is bounded on the north by the Siberian craton and on the south by the North China craton and the Tarim craton , which provides substrate for the Tarim Basin . The CAOB encompasses parts of six nations : China , Mongolia , Russia , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , and Uzbekistan . It includes mountain ranges north of Tibet , including the Tian Shan ( Chinese for heavenly mountains ) where a good example of Paleozoic arc accretion is exposed . The Altai Mountains of Russia , Kazakhstan , northwest China and western Mongolia also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well exposed in Kazakhstan , the South Gobi Range of southern Mongolia , the Beishan and Inner Mongolia of northern China , the Sayan Mountains of southern Siberia just north of Mongolia , the ranges of Buratia in southern Siberia south of Lake Baikal , and in the Far East of China and Russia . # Geologic evolution # There has been much discussion about the tectonic evolution of the CAOB over the last two decades , and these interpretations fall into two general groups . One group of researchers suggests that the belt grew , in the Neoproterozoic and Palaeozoic , from the margin of the Siberian craton to the south through accretion of island arcs and Precambrian continental blocks until the evolution was terminated through collision with the North China and Tarim cratons in the latest Paleozoic to early Mesozoic ( Windley et al. , 2007 ; Krner et al. , 2007 ; Xiao et al. , 2010 ) . The original paleogeographic position of the continental blocks is debated , but some studies suggest a Gondwana affinity of many allochthonous terranes ( Dobretsov et al. , 2003 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Siberian or Tarim origin for the same blocks ( Kuzmichev , 2001 ; Rojas-Agramonte et al. , 2010 ) . The second group of researchers regards the CAOB as mainly composed of a huge Paleozoic subduction-accretion complex ( Sengr et al. , 1993 ) , which accumulated against a single , long magmatic arc . The CAOB , like other major accretionary orogens , consists of : # accretionary wedges ; # island arc , forearc and back-arc systems , largely dismembered ophiolites , oceanic plateaux ; # blocks of older continental crust , ranging in age from Archaean to Neoproterozoic ; # synorogenic granite and metamorphic rocks including exhumed HP-UHP metamorphic rocks , # clastic sedimentary basins ; # Permian post-collisional granitoids and intraplate igneous suites . Large-scale late Paleozoic shear zones follow the orogenic grain . There are many controversies about CAOB tectono-magmatic evolution . One is the problem of juvenile versus recycled crust in the formation of CAOB igneous rocks . On one hand , the CAOB is considered to be the most important site of juvenile crust formation since the Neoproterozoic , because during its amalgamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magmatic units , massive amounts of granitic magmas were generated with juvenile Nd isotopic signatures ( Jahn , 2004 ) . However , recently obtained detrital and xenocrystic zircon ages confirmed an important role for older crust in the orogens evolution ( e.g. , Rino et al. , 2008 ; Safonova et al. , 2010 ; Rojas-Agramonte et al. , 2011 ) . The modest Neoproterozoic and huge early-middle Paleozoic zircon age spectra matche CAOB crustal growth very well but older peaks of 1.8 Ga and 2.7 Ga suggest the involvement of older crust . # References # *Dobretsov , N.L. , Buslov , M.M.

4 The Caeroesi ( spelling variants include Caeraesi , Ceroesi , Cerosi ) were a tribe living in Belgic Gaul when Julius Caesar 's Roman forces entered the area in 57 BCE . They are know from his account of the ' ' Gallic War ' ' . They are generally also equated with the Cracates mentioned briefly by Tacitus in his ' ' Histories ' ' . They were one of a group of tribes listed by his local informants as the ' ' Germani ' ' , along with the Eburones , Condrusi , Paemani ( or Caemani ) , and Segni . These tribes are referred to as the ' ' Germani Cisrhenani ' ' , to distinguish them from Germani living on the east of the Rhine , outside of the Gaulish and Roman area . Whether this meant that they actually spoke a Germanic language or not , is still uncertain , but it was claimed by Tacitus that these Germani were the original Germani , and that the term ' ' Germani ' ' as it came to be widely used was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original ' ' Germani ' ' in his time were the Tungri . The general area of the Belgian ' ' Germani ' ' was between the Scheldt and Rhine rivers , and north of Luxemburg and the Moselle , which is where the Treverii lived . In modern terms this area includes eastern Belgium , the southern parts of the Netherlands , and a part of Germany on the west of the Rhine , but north of Koblenz . The Caeroesi appear to have lived in the south of this range , in the Eifel region , in the area which later because the Roman ' ' pagus ' ' of Carucum , a sub-division of the Treveri . Later this became the Frankish pagus called Caroascus. 180pxthumbBoundary marker of the ' ' Pagus Carucum ' ' . A Roman era boundary marker has been found near Neidenbach bei Kyllburg marked FINIS PAGI CARV CVM ( the boundary or end of the Carucum pagus ) .

This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the east of Neidenbach , the Vinxtbach , a small river flowing eastwards to the Rhine , marked the boundary between the Roman provinces of Germania Superior and Germania Inferior . The name Vinxtbach is in fact thought to derive from the Latin word ' ' finis ' ' , meaning an end or boundary . Today the Vinxtbach is still a boundary between modern German dialects , with Ripuarian to the north , and Moselle Frankish to the south . Also nearby is the modern boundary of modern German ' ' Lnder ' ' of Rheinland-Pfalz and Nordrhein-Westfalen . Their name is believed to mean sheep people , and to be Celtic in origin . 
4 The Battle of Biberach was fought on 2 October 1796 between a First French Republic army led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau and a Habsburg Austrian army led by Maximilian Anton Karl , Count Baillet de Latour . The French army paused in its retreat toward the Rhine River to savage the pursuing Austrians . The action occurred during the War of the First Coalition , part of the French Revolutionary Wars . Biberach an der Riss is located 35km mi southwest of Ulm . During the summer of 1796 , the two armies of Jean-Baptiste Jourdan in the north and Moreau in the south advanced into southern Germany . They were opposed by Archduke Charles , Duke of Teschen who oversaw two Austrian armies under Latour and Wilhelm von Wartensleben .

88514 The 1988 Cotton Bowl Classic was a college football bowl game played on January 1 , 1988 , at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas , Texas , USA . The bowl game featuredthe Independent Fighting Irish of Notre Dame versus the Southwest Conference Champion Aggies of Texas A&amp;M . Played in front of 73,006 people , Texas A&amp;M won the game by a final score of 35-10 . This was the final Cotton Bowl played without a sponsor for the game . # Game Summary # An added bonus to the 1988 Cotton Bowl was Notre Dames Tim Brown , a Dallas native and the 53rd winner of the Heisman Trophy . Browns presence marked the third time in four seasons the Heisman winner would play in the Cotton Bowl . He also was the Irishs seventh Heisman winner , but the first ever to play in a bowl game . Brown and the Irish were the talk of the town , and the excitement led right up to kickoff . The game was barely three minutes old when Brown delivered . Having returned the opening kickoff 37 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when quarterback Terry Andrysiak hit his All-America receiver with a 17-yard scoring pass . Down 7-0 , the Aggies countered on Scott Slaters 26-yard field goal on the final play of the first quarter , but at that point the game belonged clearly to Notre Dame . The Irish took the ensuing kickoff and marched 51 yards for Ted Gradels 36-yard field goal and a 10-3 advantage . Four minutes later , Notre Dame was on the move again . Driving from their own 20 . Andrysiak and Brown quickly moved the Irish back into scoring position . On second down at the A&amp;M 18 , Andrysiak dropped back to pass and his target was tight end Andy Heck .

96514 Following is a sampling of some of NASA 's past and present programs excluding manned spacecraft . The years in brackets are for first and latest launching . A program is a number of flights or missions with the same kind of satellite , therefore the name of the program and the name of the satellite used will often be the same . In all NASA have made more than 1,000 unmanned missions into Earth orbit or beyond . # List of programs # # Explorer program ( 1958 ) # The Explorer program continues and over more than five decades has launched 90+ missions into Space . It has matured into one of NASA 's lower-cost mission programs , relative to its other programs . It began as a U.S. Army proposal to place a scientific satellite into orbit during the International Geophysical Year ( 195758 ) ; however , that proposal was rejected in favor of the U.S. Navy 's Project Vanguard . The Explorer program was later reestablished to catch up with the Soviet Union after that nation 's launch of Sputnik 1 on October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1958 ; at this time the project still belonged to ABMA and JPL . Besides being the first U.S. satellite , it is known for discovering the Van Allen radiation belt . The Explorer program was transferred to NASA , which continued to use the name for an ongoing series of relatively small space missions , typically an artificial satellite with a science focus . Over the years , NASA has launched a series of Explorer spacecraft carrying a wide variety of scientific investigations . # Pioneer program ( 19581978 ) # The Pioneer program is a series of NASA unmanned space missions that was designed for planetary exploration . There were a number of such missions in the program , but the most notable were Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 , which explored the outer planets and left the solar system . Both carry a golden plaque , depicting a man and a woman and information about the origin and the creators of the probes , should any extraterrestrials find them someday . Additionally , the Pioneer mission to Venus consisted of two components , launched separately . Pioneer Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the planet for more than a decade after orbital insertion in 1978 . Pioneer Venus 2 or Pioneer Venus Multiprobe sent four small probes into the Venusian atmosphere . # Echo Project ( 19601964 ) # Project Echo was the first passive communications satellite experiment . Each spacecraft was a metalized balloon satellite to be inflated in space and acting as a passive reflector of microwave signals . Communication signals were bounced off of them from one-point on Earth to another . NASA 's Echo 1 satellite was built by Gilmore Schjeldahl Company in Northfield , Minnesota . Following the failure of the Delta rocket carrying Echo 1 on May 13 , 1960 , Echo 1A was put successfully into a 944 to 1,048 mi orbit by another Thor-Delta and a microwave transmission from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California was received at Bell Laboratories in Homdel , New Jersey on August 12 , 1960 . Echo 2 was a 41.1-meter ( 135 ft ) diameter metalized PET film balloon , which was the last balloon satellite launched by Project Echo . It used an improved inflation system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was launched January 25 , 1964 on a Thor Agena rocket . # Ranger program ( 19611965 ) # The Ranger program was a series of unmanned space missions by the United States in the 1960s whose objective was to obtain the first close-up images of the surface of the Moon . The Ranger spacecraft were designed to take images of the lunar surface , returning those images until they were destroyed upon impact . A series of mishaps , however , led to the failure of the first six flights . At one point , the program was called shoot and hope . Congress launched an investigation into problems of management at NASA Headquarters and Jet Propulsion Laboratory . After reorganizing the organization twice , Ranger 7 successfully returned images in July 1964 , followed by two more successful missions . Ranger was originally designed , beginning in 1959 , in three distinct phases , called blocks . Each block had different mission objectives and progressively more advanced system design . The JPL mission designers planned multiple launches in each block , to maximize the engineering experience and scientific value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight . Total research , development , launch , and support costs for the Ranger series of spacecraft ( Rangers 1 through 9 ) was approximately $170 million . # Telstar ( 19621963 , commercial project with NASA contribution ) # Telstar was not a NASA program but a commercial communication satellite project . NASA 's contribution to it was limited to launch services , as well as tracking and telemetry duties . The first two Telstar satellites were experimental and nearly identical . Telstar 1 was launched on top of a Thor-Delta rocket on July 10 , 1962 . It successfully relayed through space the first television pictures , telephone calls , fax images and provided the first live transatlantic television feed . Telstar 2 was launched May 7 , 1963 . Bell Telephone Laboratories designed and built the Telstar satellite . They were prototypes intended to prove various concepts behind the large constellation of orbiting satellites . The faceted 171 lb ( 77 kg ) sphere had a diameter of a little more than 34 inches ( about 1 m ) . Bell Telephone Laboratories also developed much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar cells , and traveling wave tube amplifiers . To handle Telstar communications , AT&amp;T built ground stations at Andover , Maine ; Pleumeur-Bodou , France ; and Goonhilly Downs , Britain . These were similar to , but larger than , the ground station used for project Echo . Telstar was a technical success . A US . Information Agency ( USIA ) poll showed that Telstar was better known in Great Britain than Sputnik had been in 1957 . In contrast to Sputnik , Telstar 's signals were useful . # Mariner program ( 19631973 ) # The Mariner program conducted by NASA launched a series of robotic interplanetary probes designed to investigate Mars , Venus and Mercury . The program included a number of firsts , including the first planetary flyby , the first pictures from another planet , the first planetary orbiter , and the first gravity assist maneuver . Of the ten vehicles in the Mariner series , seven were successful and three were lost . The planned Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 vehicles evolved into Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 of the Voyager program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged versions of the Mariner 9 spacecraft . Other Mariner-based spacecraft , launched since Voyager , included the Magellan probe to Venus , and the Galileo probe to Jupiter . A second-generation Mariner spacecraft , called the Mariner Mark II series , eventually evolved into the CassiniHuygens probe , now in orbit around Saturn . All Mariner spacecraft were based on a hexagonal or octagonal bus , which housed all of the electronics , and to which all components were attached , such as antennae , cameras , propulsion , and power sources . All probes except Mariner 1 , Mariner 2 and Mariner 5 had TV cameras . The first five Mariners were launched on Atlas-Agena rockets , while the last five used the Atlas-Centaur . All Mariner-based probes after Mariner 10 used the Titan IIIE , Titan IV unmanned rockets or the Space Shuttle with a solid-fueled Inertial Upper Stage and multiple planetary flybys. # Surveyor program ( 19661968 ) # The Surveyor Program was a NASA program that , from 1966 through 1968 , sent seven robotic spacecraft to the surface of the Moon . Its primary goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon . The mission called for the craft to travel directly to the moon on an impact trajectory ( no orbit first ) , on a journey that lasted 63 to 65 hours , and ended with a deceleration of just over three minutes to a soft-landing . The program was implemented by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) to prepare for the Apollo program . The total cost of the Surveyor program was officially $469 million . Five of the Surveyor craft successfully soft-landed on the moon , including the first one . Two failed : Surveyor 2 crashed at high velocity after a failed mid-course correction , and Surveyor 4 was lost for contact ( possibly exploding ) 2.5 minutes before its scheduled touch-down . All seven spacecraft are still on the Moon ; none of the missions included returning them to Earth . Some parts of Surveyor 3 were returned to Earth by the crew of Apollo 12 , which landed near it in 1969 . The camera from this craft is on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington , DC. # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helios II space probes , also known as Helios-A and Helios-B , were a pair of probes launched into heliocentric orbit for the purpose of studying solar processes . A joint venture of the Federal Republic of Germany ( West Germany ) and NASA , the probes were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , Florida , on Dec 10 , 1974 , and Jan 15 , 1976 , respectively . The probes are notable for setting a maximum speed record among spacecraft at /h ( 157,078 mi/h or 43.63 mi/s or /s or 0.000234c ) . The Helios space probes completed their primary missions by the early 1980s , but they continued to send data up to 1985 . The probes are no longer functional but still remain in their elliptical orbit around the Sun . # Viking program ( 1975 ) # The Viking program consisted of a pair of space probes sent to MarsViking 1 and Viking 2 . Each vehicle was composed of two main parts , an orbiter designed to photograph the surface of Mars from orbit , and a lander designed to study the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication relays for the landers once they touched down . Viking 1 was launched on August 20 , 1975 , and the second craft , Viking 2 , was launched on September 9 , 1975 , both riding atop Titan III-E rockets with Centaur upper stages . By discovering many geological forms that are typically formed from large amounts of water , the Viking program caused a revolution in scientific ideas about water on Mars . The primary objectives of the Viking orbiters were to transport the landers to Mars , perform reconnaissance to locate and certify landing sites , act as a communications relays for the landers , and to perform their own scientific investigations . The orbiter , based on the earlier Mariner 9 spacecraft , was an octagon approximately 2.5m ft across . The total launch mass was , of which were propellant and attitude control gas . # Voyager program ( 1977 ) # The Voyager program is a series of NASA unmanned space missions that consists of a pair of unmanned scientific probes , Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 . They were launched in 1977 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1970s . Although they were officially designated to study just Jupiter and Saturn , the two probes were able to continue their mission into the outer solar system . Both probes have achieved escape velocity from the solar system and will never return . Both missions have gathered large amounts of data about the gas giants of the solar system , of which little was previously known . , Voyager 1 was at a distance of 115.251 AU ( 17.242 billion km , or 10.712 billion miles ) , traveling away from both the Earth and the Sun at a speed of /s , which corresponds to a greater specific orbital energy than any other probe . # High Energy Astronomy Observatory 1 ( 1977 ) # The first of NASA 's three High Energy Astronomy Observatories , HEAO 1 , launched August 12 , 1977 aboard an Atlas rocket with a Centaur upper stage , operated until January 9 , 1979 . During that time , it scanned the X-ray sky almost three times over 0.2 keV 10 MeV , provided nearly constant monitoring of X-ray sources near the ecliptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of objects through pointed observations . HEAO included four large X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy instruments , known as A1 , A2 , A3 , and A4 , respectively ( before launch , HEAO 1 was known as HEAO A ) . The orbital inclination was about 22.7 degrees . HEAO 1 re-entered the Earth 's atmosphere on March 15 , 1979. # Solar Maximum Mission ( 1980 ) # The Solar Maximum Mission satellite ( or SolarMax ) was designed to investigate solar phenomenon , particularly solar flares . It was launched on February 14 , 1980 . Although not unique in this endeavor , the SMM was notable in that its useful life compared with similar spacecraft was significantly increased by the direct intervention of a manned space mission . During STS-41-C in 1984 , the Space Shuttle Challenger intercepted the SMM , maneuvering it into the shuttle 's payload bay for maintenance and repairs . SMM had been fitted with a shuttle grapple fixture so that the shuttle 's robot arm could grab it for repair . The mission was depicted in the 1985 IMAX movie The Dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 , 1989 , when the spacecraft re-entered the atmosphere and burned up . # Infrared Astronomical Satellite , IRAS ( 1983 ) # The Infrared Astronomical Satellite ( IRAS ) was the first-ever space-based observatory to perform a survey of the entire sky at infrared wavelengths . It discovered about 350,000 sources , many of which are still awaiting identification . New discoveries included a dust disk around Vega and the first images of the Milky Way Galaxy 's core . IRAS 's life , like that of most of infrared satellites that followed after , was limited by its cooling system . To effectively work in the infrared domain , the telescope must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures . In IRAS 's case , 73 kilograms of superfluid helium kept the telescope at a temperature of 2 kelvins ( about 271 C ) by evaporation . The supply of liquid helium was depleted after 10 months on November 22 , 1983 , causing the telescope temperature to rise and preventing further observations . The spacecraft continues to orbit close to the earth . The telescope was a joint project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NIVR ) , and the United Kingdom ( SERC ) . Over 250,000 infrared sources were observed at 12 , 25 , 60 , and 100 micrometer wavelengths. # Magellan probe ( 1989 ) # The Magellan spacecraft was a space probe sent to the planet Venus , the first unmanned interplanetary spacecraft to be launched by NASA since its successful Pioneer Orbiter , also to Venus , in 1978 . It was also the first of three deep-space probes to be launched on the Space Shuttle , and the first spacecraft to employ aerobraking techniques to lower its orbit . Magellan created the first ( and currently the best ) high resolution mapping of the planet 's surface features . Prior Venus missions had created low resolution radar globes of general , continent-sized formations . Magellan , performed detailed imaging and analysis of craters , hills , ridges , and other geologic formations , to a degree comparable to the visible-light photographic mapping of other planets . # Galileo probe ( 1989 ) # Galileo was an unmanned spacecraft sent by NASA to study the planet Jupiter and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Space Shuttle Atlantis on the STS-34 mission . It arrived at Jupiter on December 7 , 1995 , a little more than six years later , via gravitational assist flybys of Venus and Earth . Despite antenna problems , Galileo conducted the first asteroid flyby , discovered the first asteroid moon , was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter , and launched the first probe into Jupiter 's atmosphere . Galileo 's prime mission was a two-year study of the Jovian system . The spacecraft traveled around Jupiter in elongated ellipses , each orbit lasting about two months . The differing distances from Jupiter afforded by these orbits allowed Galileo to sample different parts of the planet 's extensive magnetosphere . The orbits were designed for close up flybys of Jupiter 's largest moons . Once Galileo 's prime mission was concluded , an extended mission followed starting on December 7 , 1997 ; the spacecraft made a number of daring close flybys of Jupiter 's moons Europa and Io . The closest approach was ( 112 mi ) on October 15 , 2001 . On September 21 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of service in the Jovian system ( around Jupiter ) , Galileo 's mission was terminated by sending the orbiter into Jupiter 's atmosphere at a speed of nearly 50 kilometers per second . The program 's funding was running out and the spacecraft was low on propellant ; in addition , many systems were damaged . One of the reasons given for its destruction was to avoid the chance of it contaminating local moons with bacteria from Earth . Of particular interest was the ice-crusted moon Europa , which , thanks to Galileo , scientists now suspect harbors a salt water ocean beneath its surface . # Hubble Space Telescope ( 1990 ) # The Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) is a space telescope that was carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle in April 1990 . It is named after American astronomer Edwin Hubble . Although not the first space telescope , Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile , and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy . The HST is a collaboration between NASA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Great Observatories , along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , the Chandra X-ray Observatory , and the Spitzer Space Telescope . The HST 's success has paved the way for greater collaboration between the agencies . The HST was created with a relatively small budget of $2 billion and has continued operation since 1990 , delighting both scientists and the public . Some of its images , such as the groundbreaking Hubble Deep Field , have become famous . # Ulysses ( 1990 ) # Ulysses is a decommissioned robotic space probe that was designed to study the Sun as a joint venture of NASA and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) . Due to the loss of Challenger , the launch of Ulysses was delayed until October 6 , 1990 aboard ' ' Discovery ' ' ( mission STS-41 ) . The spacecraft 's mission was to study the Sun at all latitudes . To do this required a major orbital plane shift . Due to velocity change limitations of the Shuttle and the Inertial Upper Stage ( IUS ) , this was accomplished by using an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an engine burn . The need for a Jupiter encounter meant that Ulysses could not be powered by solar cells and was powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator ( RTG ) instead . By February 2008 , the power output from the RTG , which is generated by heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium-238 , had decreased enough to leave insufficient power for internal heaters to keep the spacecraft 's attitude control hydrazine fuel from freezing . The end of mission was at one-point scheduled for July 1 , 2008 , but mission scientists came up with a method to keep the fuel liquid by conducting a short thruster burn every two hours , allowing the mission to continue . The cessation of mission operations and deactivation or hibernation of the spacecraft was determined by the inability to prevent attitude control fuel from freezing . The last day for mission operations on Ulysses was June 30 , 2009. # Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite , UARS ( 1991 ) # UARS is a science satellite used from 1991 to 2005 to study Earth 's atmosphere , including the ozone layer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durable , allowing extended observation from its instrument suite . It was launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery and deployed into space from the payload bay with its robotic arm , under guidance from the crew . The satellite was expected to undergo atmospheric re-entry in the late evening of Friday September 23 , 2011 or early morning of Saturday September 24 , 2011 , Eastern Daylight Time . On 24 September 2011 1:09 am EDT UARS made its re-entry . At around about 6 tonnes , it was the heaviest NASA satellite to undergo uncontrolled atmospheric entry since Skylab in the summer 1979 , which was roughly 70 tonnes . It is heavier than Pegasus 2 , which fell back in fall of 1979 , but weighed less than 2 tonnes . # Discovery Program ( 19922011 ) # NASA 's Discovery Program ( as compared to New Frontiers , Explorers , or Flagship Programs ) is a series of lower-cost , highly-focused American scientific space missions that are exploring the Solar System . It was founded in 1992 to implement then-NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin 's vision of faster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional NASA missions where targets and objectives are pre-specified . Instead , these cost-capped missions are proposed and led by a scientist called the Principal Investigator ( PI ) . Proposing teams may include people from industry , small businesses , government laboratories , and universities . Proposals are selected through a competitive peer review process . All of the completed Discovery missions are accomplishing ground-breaking science and adding significantly to the body of knowledge about the Solar System . NASA also accepts proposals for competitively selected Discovery Program Missions of Opportunity . This provides opportunities to participate in non-NASA missions by providing funding for a science instrument or hardware components of a science instrument or to re-purpose an existing NASA spacecraft . These opportunities are currently offered through NASA 's Stand Alone Mission of Opportunity program . Examples of missions are Mars Pathfinder , Kepler , Stardust , Genesis and Deep Impact . The Mars Pathfinder ( MESUR Pathfinder , ) later renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station , was launched on December 4 , 1996 , just a month after the Mars Global Surveyor was launched . On board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execute many experiments on the Martian surface . It was the second project from NASA 's Discovery Program , which promotes the use of low-cost spacecraft and frequent launches under the motto cheaper , faster and better promoted by the then administrator , Daniel Goldin . The mission was directed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology , responsible for NASA 's Mars Exploration Program . Kepler is a space observatory launched by NASA to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars . The spacecraft , named in honor of the 17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler , was launched in March 2009 . Stardust is a 300-kilogram robotic space probe launched by NASA on February 7 , 1999 to study the asteroid 5535 Annefrank and collect samples from the coma of comet Wild 2 . The primary mission was completed January 15 , 2006 , when the sample return capsule returned to Earth . Operating for , Stardust intercepted comet Tempel 1 on February 15 , 2011 , a small Solar System body previously visited by Deep Impact on July 4 , 2005 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and return the sample to Earth and the first to acquire images of a previously visited comet . The Genesis spacecraft was a NASA sample return probe which collected a sample of solar wind and returned it to Earth for analysis . It was the first NASA sample return mission to return material since the Apollo Program , and the first to return material from beyond the orbit of the Moon . Genesis was launched on August 8 , 2001 , and crash-landed in Utah on September 8 , 2004 , after a design flaw prevented the deployment of its drogue parachute . The crash contaminated many of the sample collectors , but although most were damaged , many of the collectors were successfully recovered . Deep Impact is a NASA space probe launched on January 12 , 2005 . It was designed to study the composition of the comet interior of 9P/Tempel , by releasing an impactor into the comet .

514 Italian Libya Railways was a group of small railways built in the Italian colony of Libya between the two World Wars . # History # The Kingdom of Italy built in Italian Libya nearly 400 km of railways with gauge . # Projects # The Italian authorities decided to give priority to the construction of roads in Libya when Benito Mussolini took control of the Italian colonies . After 1926 no more railways were made in Libya , but during World War II the need of railways transport to the front during the war in the frontier with British Egypt changed this approach . In spring 1941 the Italian government started the construction of a new railway between Tripoli and Benghazi , but by the end of 1942 all was stopped because of the Italian defeat in north Africa : only 18 km were done in Cirenaica. # Equipment # In Libya the first locomotives were the steam locomotives R.401 and R.301 , but the most successful were the R.302 produced in northern Italy . # Railways # There were only five small railways : 1 ) Tripoli-Zuara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ km ) : 3 ) Tripoli-Garian ( 90 km ) : 4 ) Bengasi-Soluch ( 56 km ) : 5 ) Tripoli-Tagiura ( 21 km ) : <gallery> File:Tripoli Stazione Centrale.jpgTripoli Railway Station in 1940 File:Benghazi Central Station.jpgBenghazi Railway Station in 1930 File:Barce Stazione Centrale.jpgBarce Railway station in 1930 File:Benghazi Italiana.JPGItalian Benghazi with port railways File:Fiat Train Passing in to Cyrenaica.jpgFiat Littorina passing in Cirenaica File:Fiat train at Tripoli 's railway central station.jpgFiat train at Tripoli Station File:Central railway station of Tripoli.jpgOld steam train at Tripoli Station in 1920 File:Benghazi Railway System after World War II.jpgDestruction of Benghazi station in 1943 </gallery>

The Final Hours , the third and final episode of ' ' Son of God ' ' , looked at Jesus 's crucifixion , and presented some ideas as to how the traditional views of the crucifixion may conflict with how it really occurred . The episode concluded with the construction of a computer-generated animation of how Jesus may have appeared . Critical reaction to the series was mixed . While some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality , others remarked that it was dumbed down and went off on strange tangents .

Whitbourn subsequently used the seminal themes from his orchestral score as the basis of his popular choral work , ' ' Son of God Mass ' ' , for soprano saxophone , choir and organ . Computer graphic images were created by design group Red Vision , who employed techniques similar to ones used in the 2000 BBC series ' ' Walking with Dinosaurs ' ' .

In the lead-up to episode one , several newspapers , including ' ' The Daily Mail ' ' and ' ' The Guardian ' ' , ran stories speculating whether the computer-generated image could show the true face of Jesus . British television listings magazine ' ' Radio Times ' ' featured the reconstructed face on the cover of its 31 March issue under the headline Is This the Face of Jesus ? . This cover and its headline received criticism from some commentators for being sensationalist and misleading . # Episodes # ' ' Son of God ' ' consists of a single series of three episodes . Each episode lasts approximately 50 minutes and documents a different stage of Jesus 's life .

Bowen visits Jerusalem , where he calls Jesus 's death one of the best attested facts in ancient history . **33;50392;ref He cites the Romano-Jewish historian Josephus as one of 80 sources that confirms that Jesus existed and that describes him as a wise man who did surprising feats , .. won over followers from among Jews and Greeks , .. was accused by the Jewish leaders , and was condemned to be crucified by Pilate . Bowen interviews James H. Charlesworth from Princeton University about the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947 , then travels to Bethlehem to visit the Church of the Nativity , a structure built over a series of first-century caves and grottos . While there , he speculates that Jesus may have been born in a cave rather than an inn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem confirms this , saying that the Greek word katalyma is usually translated into English as upper room rather than inn . **34;50427;ref The Real Man also looks at the story of the Star of Bethlehem , which Bowen states would have been an astrological rather than astronomical phenomenon . According to astronomer Michael Molner , astrologers from around the time of Herod the Great would have believed that the constellation Aries symbolised his kingdom and the lands that he controlled during 6 BC , the year that some scholars theorise that Jesus was born , a rare planetary alignment meant that Jupiter , Saturn , the Sun and the Moon would have all appeared in this constellation . **34;50463;ref Bowen next looks at how Jesus would have been born out of wedlock : Mark Goodacre , a historian from the University of Birmingham , asserts that Jewish , pagan and Christian sources all confirm that Jesus was born out of wedlock , as do both the Gospels of Matthew and Luke . All four canonical gospels agree that the city of Nazareth was where Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , proposes that Jesus 's interest in religion and politics might have been sparked off during a family visit to the Temple Mount , the headquarters of the Jewish faith . **34;50499;ref The episode ends with Bowen spending the night alone at the Mount of Temptation just above Jericho , where Jesus is traditionally believed to have spent 40 days and nights being tempted by the devil . # The Mission # Episode two , The Mission , discusses how Jesus became popular and why the Pharisees might have seen him as a potential threat . Bowen visits the Dome of the Rock , the site of Jerusalem 's temple , and discusses how Jesus went to the Sea of Galilee to recruit his disciples . He speaks with Orna Cohen , a conservator of antiquities who led the excavation of the Sea of Galilee Boat , who suggests that the boat may have been similar to one owned by Saint Peter . Bowen then travels to Capernaum and visits the House of Peter , where he speaks to Mordechai Aviam , an archaeologist from the Israel Antiquities Authority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the house belonged to Peter . Bowen visits the tomb of a first-century scholar and miracle-worker named Hanina ben Dosa , and contrasts Hanina 's life with that of Jesus 's : for example , while Jesus was executed , Hanina was not . **32;50535;ref The Mission then looks at how Jesus may have been viewed by the religious leaders of the time . The canonical gospels report over one hundred cases of Jesus healing or performing exorcisms , and making the unclean clean again . **33;50569;ref Jesus told lepers to go up to the Temple Mount , where they were usually excluded , and claimed that he could forgive sins without going through the ordinary channels . Jesus met and ate with sinners , the disabled and prostitutes , and fulfilled Old Testament prophecy by riding into the Temple Mount through the Golden Gate on a donkey at Passover . Bowen concludes that all these reasons would have meant that the Pharisees of the time would have seen him as threatening . **33;50604;ref # The Final Hours # The Final Hours , the third episode of ' ' Son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . Bowen claims that the Last Supper would have been held in the guest room of a well-to-do house in Jerusalem . **36;50639;ref Writings by Josephus suggest that the Last Supper took place in a triclinium . As guest of honour , Jesus would have been at the end of the table with John the Apostle at his side , rather than at the centre , as proposed by more familiar depictions such as Leonardo da Vinci 's ' ' The Last Supper ' ' . Bowen then looks at whether or not Jesus could have sweated blood at Gethsemane . Leaving the Middle East for the first time , he travels to New York City and meets with Frederick Zugibe , a forensic pathologist at Columbia University . Zugibe states that Jesus may have been suffering from hematidrosis , a medical condition brought about by stress from knowing that one is about to die . He also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sailors and in men given death sentences . Zugibe experiments on volunteers in Rutland County , Vermont , by measuring their blood pressure while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level with their shoulders . He concludes that the traditional view of Jesus 's crucifixion , with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather than wrists , may have been possible if his feet were supported . The 1968 discovery of the skeleton of Jehohanan , a first-century man who was put to death by crucifixion , also supports this theory . **37;50677;ref Next , Bowen questions whether the disciple Judas Iscariot truly did double-cross Jesus . William Klassen , an historian at cole Biblique in Jerusalem , theorises that the Greek word paradidomi was mistranslated , and that Judas simply handed over Jesus to the Romans , rather than betrayed him . **37;50716;ref The Final Hours ends with a facial reconstruction suggesting what Jesus may have looked like . Using one of three first-century Jewish skulls from a forensic science department in Israel , a clay model is created through forensic anthropology by Richard Neave , a retired medical artist from the Unit of Art in Medicine at Manchester University . The graphics created by Red Vision were well received : ' ' The Daily Record ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McLean of ' ' The Guardian ' ' noted that the series was visually , .. quite a treat . McLean also commented that the programme itself was rather interesting , but that it contained slightly odd , slightly irrelevant diversions . A review of a more critical nature came from Catherine Bennett , also writing for ' ' The Guardian ' ' , who questioned the facial reconstruction from the third episode and suggested that it was dismissive to imply that it was how Jesus truly appeared . Speaking about the study , Bennett remarked : We must hope that .. future BBC controllers do not dig up , say , Robin Cook 's skull , drape it in Plasticine , and ask : ' Is this the real face of Tony Blair ? . John Preston , writing for ' ' The Sunday Telegraph ' ' , also questioned the reliability of the reconstruction , and branded the series as dumbed down . The programme received criticism from theological scholars : following the broadcast of the first episode , Tom Wright , one of two consultants used during production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been misrepresented by the show . Wright claimed that the BBC had elected to portray Jesus simply as a politically correct social worker . Father Heinrich Pfeiffer , a German professor of iconography at the Pontifical Gregorian University , similarly felt that the computer-generated face conflicted with the ones seen in the Shroud of Turin and the Manoppello Image . Reviews of the American broadcast of ' ' Jesus : The Complete Story ' ' were also mixed . While some reviewers described the show as fascinating and reverent , During its American broadcast on the Discovery Channel , the series was watched by 12 million . It was repeated in the US during March the following year , and gained a figure of 1.5 million viewers per episode .

514 The number of Chinese people in Namibia has grown tremendously since independence . # Migration history # As recently as 1998 , China Radio International reported there to be only fifty Chinese people doing business in Namibia , but by 2005 that had grown to more than a thousand . A 2009 U.S. embassy estimate released by Wikileaks in the United States diplomatic cables leak states there are three or four thousand . Opposition politicians such as Jurie Viljoen of Monitor Action Group have made accusations that uncontrolled issuance of work permits has led to an influx of as many as 40,000 Chinese labourers . # Trade # In the 2000s , trade between China and Namibia grew , rising from in $75 million in 2003 to $600 million in 2009 . China City , a wholesale and retail centre located in an industrial area of northern Windhoek about 20 minutes from downtown , was opened in 1998 by Li Chengyuan ( ) , a businessman from Taiwan ; by 2005 , merchants there were importing about 1,000 containers of goods per year from China .

Oshikango , on the border with Angola has become a popular destination for Chinese traders hoping to take advantage of expanding cross-border trade . By 2004 , the town had 22 Chinese-owned shops , expanding to 75 by 2006 . From shoes and textiles , these shops have expanded their product offerings to include furniture , home electronics , motorcycles , artificial flowers , and various other types of goods . Shop owners import their goods through the ports at Walvis Bay or Durban in South Africa , and bring them in by rail for storage in bonded warehouses , where they are then sold on to Angolan traders for export to Angola in small quantities , thus avoiding customs duties .

4 The Crooked Forest ( ) , is a grove of oddly-shaped pine trees located outside Nowe Czarnowo , West Pomerania , Poland . This grove of approximately 400 pines was planted around 1930 , when its location was still within the German province of Pomerania .

4 Mercer University School of Medicine ( MUSM ) is the graduate medical school of Mercer University . It was founded in Macon , GA in 1982 , and as of 2008 has expanded to include an additional site in Savannah , GA , with either site allowing students to complete all four requisite years of medical training . In 2012 , MUSM developed a third site in Columbus , GA at which students may elect to complete their third and fourth years of training . Mercer University School of Medicine adopts a mission that is heavily directed towards training future physicians to practice in the State of Georgia , and as such , prospective matriculants must be Georgia residents . # Academic Programs # In addition to the Doctor of Medicine degree offered by MUSM , a number of other degree programs are available through this institution : *PhD in Clinical Medical Psychology *M.S. in Biomedical Sciences *M.S. in Preclinical Sciences *Master of Family Therapy *Master of Public Health *M.S. in Anesthesia # MD Program Curriculum # Since its foundation in 1982 , Mercer University School of Medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more traditional lecture format . This Problem-Based Learning ( PBL ) approach to training students in the basic medical sciences focuses around small group discussions wherein students share didactic responsibilities and interact much more actively than in a standard lecture . In this system , each PBL group meets several times a week to review relevant literature and discuss issues pertinent to the current subject matter , and although each group contains a tutor ( a professor of MUSM ) , there is no truly identified roles of teacher and studentinstead , these roles are shared by every member of the group . Also in contrast to lecture-based programs , which generally necessitate subject exams , the PBL program makes use of multidisciplinary exams more similar in scope of content ( i.e. multiple disciplines ) to the USMLE board examinations . # Teaching Affiliates and Hospitals # # Mercer Medicine # Mercer Medicine is the clinical component of the Mercer University School of Medicine through which faculty physicians of Internal and Family Medicine provide medical care to patients , while supporting a clinical learning environment for Mercer University medical students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center of Central Georgia ( MCCG ) is located in Macon , GA and is the primary clinical site at which third and fourth year MUSM students in Macon complete their clinical training .

4 Westwood is a big village and a civil parish in Wiltshire , England . # Location # The village is located southwest of Bradford on Avon , with Avoncliff railway station , Kennet &amp; Avon canal and river Avon setting the northern boundary for the village . The neighbouring villages are Winsley and Turleigh from north , and Freshford and Sharpstone from west . # History # Westwood 's recorded history begins in 983 AD , when King Ethelred 's charters granted various pieces of land to his servant Aelfnoth , and four years later to his huntsman Leofwine . In Norman times , Westwood was one of the estates assigned for the support of the monks at Winchester Priory . The residents of the manor continued to be tenants of the Priory until it was dissolved by Henry VIII . The medieval population of Westwood , as recorded in Domesday Book of 1086 , consisted of just 13 households , growing to 45 recorded taxpayers in the late 14th century . The earliest part of the present parish church of St Mary dates from the 13th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perpendicular Gothic nave , chapel and tower were added in the late 15th century . The earliest records of a substantial quarrying industry at Westwood date from 1649 . By the mid-19th century , the quality of Westwood stone had earned a good reputation , and over the next half-century , output increased at a great rate . Westwood stone went to build many houses in Bath , as well as Holy Trinity church in Trowbridge ( 1838 ) . A narrow-gauge railway was constructed to transport the huge blocks of rough cut stone from the quarry to the cutting-yard at Avoncliff railway station . Nowadays , all that remains from the centuries of intensive quarrying is the labyrinth of tunnels , eight feet high and twelve feet wide . They have been put to a number of imaginative uses , especially after they were taken over by the Ministry of Supply in 1939 . For example , the eastern part of the quarry tunnels had since 1928 been used for growing mushrooms , as the relatively stable ambient temperatures and the high humidity of the underground were found perfectly suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment at an underground factory which had been located in the tunnels to defend against Luftwaffe raids . Additionally , by the end of 1942 the Westwood tunnels had probably housed the greatest and most valuable collection of cultural and artistic artifacts assembled in one location anywhere in the world , including exhibits from British Museum , pictures from the National Portrait Gallery , tapestries from the Victoria and Albert Museum , the Elgin Marbles , and the Wright brothers ' aeroplane . A special air conditioning plant had to be installed to control the humidity underground . 
4 ' ' Annakodi ' ' is a 2013 Tamil film directed and written by Bharathiraja . It features Lakshman Narayan , Karthika Nair and Manoj Bharathiraja in the lead roles . The film has music by G. V.

Reports also suggested that Vinay , who had previously appeared in ' ' Unnale Unnale ' ' and ' ' Jayamkondaan ' ' , was signed on to play a pivotal role although Bharathiraja 's managers later dismissed the claim . In a turn of events , the day before the shoot began , Parthiepan was replaced by Ameer to portray the title roles , with Parthiepan admitting he was left in the dark about the decision . When the Mullaperiyar Dam issue precipitated , Bharathiraja suspended the shooting of the film and sent his Keralan-born heroines home until the issue had died down . The film ran into further trouble when the tussle between the producers and FEFSI created disputes between the lead actor and director . Ameer , made remarks against the producers council and backed the FEFSI , and reports suggested that a displeased Bharathiraja opted to replace him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claim that the script needed some changes which would not suit Ameer and thus signed on his own son , Manoj , to play the lead role . Iniya was also reported to have left the project due to the delay , but she denied such claims . But her role was n't eventually incorporated in the film . Roja was selected to play the role of a wine seller and the mother of Karthika Nair . But she opted out of the film and lack of facilities was speculated to be the reason behind her decision .

4 On September 26 , 2011 , California Governor Jerry Brown signed California Law AB 1215 into law . Authored by Bob Blumenfield ( D-Woodland Hills ) , the legislation accomplishes three goals : ( 1 ) increases the fees that California car and truck dealers can charge for licensing , ( 2 ) requires dealers to use Electronic Titling ( ELT ) and ( 3 ) governs how automobile dealers disclose previously damaged used cars . The law went into effect on July 1 , 2012 . Proponents of AB 1215 included the California New Car Dealer Association , the Independent Auto Dealers Association of California , Consumers for Auto Reliability &amp; Safety and California Associates of Highway Patrol . California is often a leader in consumer protection legislation and consumer advocates hope the law will lead to a similar federal program . The bill passed the California State Assembly 67-4 and the California State Senate 30-4 before being signed by Governor Brown . Once AB 1215 goes into effect , car and truck dealers in California will be able to charge up to $80 per new or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vehicle purchase transactions and $45 for lease transactions . Documentation fees cover titling , registration and other dealership documentation requirements . Lawmakers estimate the legislation will save taxpayers as much as $9 million per year by using electronic titling systems . AB 1215 also includes a mandate for dealers to participate in the California DMV 's Business Partner Automation Program(BPA) . The BPA program enables fast and easy title and registration processes , saving the state time and labor costs and dealers/consumers needless time and paper forms at the Department of Motor Vehicles . And because of CA AB 1215 , starting on July 1 , 2012 , California new and used car and truck dealers will have to check a National Motor Vehicle Title Information System ( NMVTIS ) report before selling any used vehicle . NMVTIS vehicle history check information contains the most up-to-date DMV title information from participating states , along with the industrys most complete salvage auction , junkyard and insurance company sourced total loss information .

514 The Stanford rugby teams of 1906 to 1917 represented Stanford University as the school 's only football program during those years , replacing American football with rugby union . The school had played American football from 1892 to 1905 , but in 1906 , concerned with the growing levels of violence in football , Stanford and other universities changed to rugby . Stanford played twelve seasons of rugby , during which it played other college teams , club teams from the United States , Canada , and Australia , as well as the New Zealand national team and Australia national team . Despite the team 's success , it became clear that other schools were not adopting rugby in large numbers , and after rival California returned to football in 1915 , Stanford faced a limited number of potential opponents ; and after a year of playing neither sport officially due to World War I , the school returned to American football in 1919. # Switch to rugby # American football in the early 1900s had become increasingly violent ; with no forward pass , the ball carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own players in massive formations that often resulted in serious injuries . In 1905 , 18 deaths , three at the college level , were attributed to football ; 159 serious injuries were also reported , 88 at the college level . Reform was demanded by such voices as U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt , who decried the brutality and foul play of the game , and called a meeting of school presidents to discuss the issue . As a result , before the next season began , new rules were put in place to discourage such play . The forward pass was also introduced to open up the game and reduce the role of dangerous mass formations . Despite the planned changes , a number of universities banned the sport for the coming year , including Columbia , NYU , and Northwestern . Several universities on the West Coast , led by California and Stanford , replaced the sport with rugby . At the time , the future of football was very much in doubt and these schools believed that rugby would eventually be adopted nationwide . Other schools that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Clara , and USC ( in 1911 ) . However , due to the perception that West Coast football was inferior to the game played on the East Coast anyway , East Coast and Midwest teams shrugged off the loss of the teams and continued playing football . With no nationwide movement , the available pool of rugby teams to play remained small . The schools scheduled games against local club teams and reached out to rugby powers in Australia , New Zealand , and especially , due to its proximity , Canada . The annual Big Game between Stanford and California continued as rugby , with the winner invited by the British Columbia Rugby Union to a tournament in Vancouver over the Christmas holidays , with the winner of that tournament receiving the Cooper Keith Trophy . # Return to football # In 12 seasons of rugby , Stanford was remarkably successful : the team had three undefeated seasons , three one-loss seasons , and an overall record of 94 wins , 20 losses , and 3 ties for a winning percentage of .816 . However , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its newly adopted sport , which was not spreading as many had hoped . Students and alumni began to clamor for a return to football to allow wider intercollegiate competition . The pressure at rival California was stronger ( especially as the school had not been as successful in the Big Game as they had hoped ) , and in 1915 California returned to football . As reasons for the change , the school cited football rule changes , the overwhelming desire of students and supporters to play football , interest in playing other East Coast and Midwest schools , and a patriotic desire to play an American game . California 's return to football increased the pressure on Stanford to also change back in order to maintain the rivalry . Stanford played its 1915 , 1916 , and 1917 Big Games as rugby against Santa Clara and California 's football Big Game in those years was against Washington , but both schools desired to restore the old traditions . The onset of World War I gave Stanford an out : in 1918 , the Stanford campus was designated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , Nevada , and Utah , and the commanding officer , Sam M.

4 The deaf community over time has worked to improve the educational system for those who are deaf and hard of hearing . The history of deaf education dates back to Ancient Egypt where the deaf were respected and revered . In contrast , those who were deaf in Ancient Greece were considered a burden to society and put to death . The educational aspects of the deaf community has evolved tremendously and still continues to grow as new technologies , laws , and educational strategies on local , national , and international levels are steadily being introduced . # Ancient Egypt # During the BC era , the disabled were not harmed or killed by the Egyptians despite the fact that they had birth defects . This is due to the fact that the Egyptians lived by a philanthropic way of life . Many of the disabled citizens displayed talents that were not easily acquired . The deaf were considered to be especially selected by the gods because of their peculiar behavior . This behavior was a direct result of their disability to hear and desire to communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of hieroglyphs and gesture signs . # Ancient Greece # Sign language was first documented in ancient Greece . In one of Plato 's dialogues he describes how the deaf used gestures to mimic moving objects through similar motions . Plato quotes his teacher Socrates in the Cratylus as follows : if we had neither voice nor tongue , and yet wished to manifest things to one another , should we not , like those which are at present mute , endeavor to signify our meaning by the hands , head , and other parts of the body ? .... I think , therefore that if we wished to signify that which is upwards and light , we should raise our hands towards the heaven , imitating the nature of the thing itself ; but that if we wished to indicate things downwards and heavy , we should point with our hands to the earth .. Unlike ancient Egypt , the Greeks felt it was better to kill anyone with a disability . The deaf were especially considered a burden in Athens , where it was believed that anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death . The city of Athens felt that ending the lives of those impaired was in the best interests of the state . This was due to the fact that war and conflict occurred continuously and certain abilities were considered important to have . Everyone was meant to serve the state . Philosopher Aristotle along with Greek physician Galen concluded that the deaf could never speak , believing that the ability to speak and hear were linked ; being derived from the same area in the brain . Galen , feeling that if one capability was impaired the other would be impaired also , was considered to be correct . Additionally Aristotle 's views , which were similarly related to Galen 's , were also viewed as accurate and this idea went unchallenged until the sixteenth century A.D. # Key Figures # # Pedro Ponce de Leon a Spanish Benedictine monk # During the mid-sixteenth century brothers Pedro and Francisco Fernandez Velasco y Tovar , were sent to live in a monastery by the name of Ona where they were under the guidance of Pedro Ponce de Leon . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful families in Spain . At that time , the noble families sent their disabled children to monasteries because it was believed that the children 's disabilities were directly related to the sins of the parents . For this reason , the families hid their children because they were ashamed . During this time ten percent of children born to noble families were deaf . This was due to the fact that noble families in Spain during this time married their blood relatives to keep the wealth within the family . The Velasco boys were placed under the care of Ponce because of their attachment to him when they arrived at the monastery . Ponce himself had become attached to the boys and decided to educate them . Many critics credit Ponce with being the first person to educate the deaf , but it is stated by Van Cleve in Deaf History Unveiled that he was in fact not the first person to educate the deaf but the first person to teach the deaf to speak . He then argues that a monk from La Estrella , whose name is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with educating the deaf . Contrastingly in the History of Deaf People written by Per Eriksson , he credits St. John of Beverley with being the first person to educate the deaf . St. John was the archbishop of York , England around 700 A.D. He is considered to be the first to disagree with Aristotle 's opinion of a deaf person 's ability to learn . # Sign Language # Communication came from both the homes of the deaf in addition to the monasteries they were sent to . # 19th Century # # Advocates # # #Thomas Fox# # Thomas Fox was born on November 16 , 1859 . He became deaf at age ten after having spinal meningitis . Soon after his parents enrolled him in the New York School for the Deaf in which he became a part of the deaf community . After leaving the New York School for the Deaf he enrolled in Gallaudet College in 1879 . During his time at Gallaudet , Fox went to a meeting for the National Association of the Deaf . While at this meeting Fox became a promoter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preconceptions against deaf people made in an attempt to remove certain cultural aspects of the deaf community . However , the specifics of the criticisms were not mentioned in detail . Fox wanted Deaf Schools to remain active , along with the job availability for deaf Instructors and language interpretation within the classes . After graduating from Gallaudet he returned to his grade school in New York to teach . After his retirement he remained involved in the school 's activities until his death in 1945. # 20th Century # # Cochlear Implant # The cochlear implant is a device surgically implanted in the skull that provides stimulation to the nerve to promote hearing . It is a prosthetic with wires attached to the cochlea and is located behind the ear . The cochlear implant has a microphone , connecting cables , a speech processor , and a battery . The processor converts sounds into electrical impulses by taking information from sound patterns and producing an electrical pulse in the ear of the host . Although the implant does provide an artificial means by which its hosts can hear , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not elevate sound . With this implant , sounds are not the same as sounds that a hearing person experiences . Since the Cochlear implant is in fact brain surgery , it destroys the cochlea in the process of implantation . Teaching recipients to understand the sounds they hear takes years and there is no guarantee they will be able to make sense of the information . Therefore the cochlear implant is not able to give all deaf people hearing and speech . # Economic/Job Opportunities # During the mid to late 20th century , a study showed that two-thirds of American adults with disabilities did not have a job . It was also found that around eighty percent of those unemployed had the desire to work . Employers often said they did not provide adequate accommodations for those with disabilities . They were also unsure if they could trust those persons with disabilities to perform requested tasks correctly . As result of these problems the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) of 1990 was ratified . This prevented discrimination against those with disabilities in both private and governmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing needed accommodations on the employer . # 21st Century # # Efforts Around the World # # China # Since more individuals with disabilities live in China than any other country in the world , special education has become an important area of focus . China once had great ideological resources in this field ; yet , the schools for the disabled created in the late nineteenth century were established by Western missionaries . Since the late nineteen hundreds the legislation has expressed its concern and made efforts to encourage the progress of Special education in China . # Canada # In Canada , efforts have been made to adopt a bilingual-bicultural model of education , using American Sign Language ( ASL ) as its standard language for instruction . It is assumed that this approach will lead to an enhancement in learning , expression and achievement in deaf students . # International Laws # # Disability Acts # # #Australia# # National and worldwide legislation has focused an increasing amount of attention on the values of inclusion . This attitude is geared toward those with disabilities . Inclusive education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudes concerning students with disabilities . UNESCOs education policy was approved at the Salamanca Conference in 1944 and establishes the privilege to education for all disabled students . It has been considered a basic human right despite the fact that disabled students will need adequate accommodations . The international focus has been placed on the Rights of Children ( 1989 ) as well . World leaders have made a commitment to find ways to increase the amount of children who attend school . In result the national policies have been impacted by these developments . In Australia , the viewpoint of education has been modeled after those international trends . Australia has made efforts to see that all of their students are educated . Moreover the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 has played an important role in support of education for the disabled as well . Australia has presented itself as a country in great support of human rights . This act was implemented with the intent to secure the rights of the disabled . Additionally the Disability Discrimination Act has three key purposes : to discourage discrimination , to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insure the acceptance of the disabled by communities . # #Africa# # South Africas constitution and the Integrated National Disability Strategy along with other legislation claims to be one of the most proactive methods in support of the disable . Yet , most of the sentimentality does not exceed policy level and the enforcement of these guidelines has trailed far behind . # ASL Training # American Sign Language ( ASL ) is used both in the United States and in English speaking parts of Canada . It is considered a language although it is produced with gestures and seen with the eyes . Since ASL does not require the use of voice or the ability to hear it is used by deaf persons . Sign language is collective worldwide ; instead it is similar to other languages having different signs in different cultures . A resident from Great Britain does not necessarily understand ASL because Britain and America have two different sign languages even though both countries primarily speak English and the written language is quite parallel . Actually ASL is more closely related to French sign ; sharing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one another . Yet another misunderstanding is that ASL can be directly translated to the English language . This however is false , when the grammar is compared ASL and English are just as different as any two native languages . Contrary to what has been presumed sign languages do have a specific format . They are not just different signs representing a word combined together to create speech . As oral languages have a particular format in which the words are presented , sign languages has its own format as well . Just as errors are made in the English language with a slight mispronunciation or mistaken letter arrangement , ASL can have the same errors with just a slight difference in gestures that are similar . This does not mean that grammar rules of oral language is in anyway directly related to that of sign language , but the same concept can be taken into account . Although we can compare the processes of developing ASL with that of the spoken English language the difference between the two must be recognized . The qualitative factor of ASL is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phonetic structure of oral languages , with relatively few suprasegmental features , contrasts with a greater degree of simultaneity in sign languages . Sign languages have four simultaneously realized parameters : hand configuration , location , movement and orientation . Hand configuration , location and movement are what determine what is being signed . A simple combination of words can differ in just location , movement , or the way in which you hold your hand as you are signing . # Politics # # Equality # During the early 1900s membership to various deaf organizations was denied to African Americans . Associations and even some churches prevented African Americans from becoming members including the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf . There were fewer people to relate to who shared the same ethnic background and many of the Caucasian deaf leaders made no attempt to improve the quality of the black deaf community . During this time racism was more prevalent and there were perhaps shared views of the blacks by both hearing and deaf white males . Because of this National Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made against deaf women . Colleges produced more male graduates than female , and deaf females were completely excluded or had only limited access to various club affiliations . They were also given easier workloads by teachers . Associations at national and state levels had no or only small amounts of actual participation by women . Women were often allowed to give their opinions or share their ideas for support of the preservation of sign language and the deaf community , but they did not hold any authoritative positions that allowed them to make decisions on behalf of the deaf community . Even though they had a tough time being heard , deaf women still continued to seek involvement in language and cultural preservation . They eventually begin to establish their own clubs and organizations in which they expressed their ideas and views on issues concerning the deaf community . Associations such as the Camp Fire Girls at state schools and the OWLs at Gallaudet College were formed in support of deaf women of Caucasian ethnicity. # Preservation of Sign Language # The deaf community made continuous efforts to help preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language and promote oral communication . The attempt to supplant sign language , by the hearing , lead to the production of dictionaries and films intended to expose and promote sign language in the oral community as well as the deaf . Many deaf people spent most of their free time socializing with their deaf peers and joined clubs within the deaf community after graduating from school . Their efforts continued in the promotion of the preservation of sign language .

Born about 1186 , he rebuilt the destroyed castle after 1204 . He married in 1222 and resided over the castle together with his cousin Pierre-Roger de Mirepoix who also became his in-law by marrying Philippa , Raymond 's daughter , around 1239 . Under Raymond 's protection , Guilhabert de Castres set up the center of Catharism at Montsgur around 1232 . The fall of Montsgur in 1244 ended organized Carthar activity in the Occitan region . Surviving the end of Montsgur he was interrogated by the inquisition in May , 1244.

4 Colonel Walter Howard Tunbridge CB , CMG , CBE ( 2 November 1856 &amp;ndash ; 11 October 1943 ) was an Australian architect and soldier . He was born in Dover , Kent , to bricklayer John Nicholas Tunbridge and Anne , ' ' ne ' ' Denne . Educated at Eythorne , he migrated to Australia in 1884 and established himself as an architect in Townsville , where he would eventually establish the civil engineering , architecture and surveying firm Tunbridge &amp; Tunbridge . In February 1889 he was commissioned in the Mounted Infantry of the Queensland Land Forces , and in December was promoted lieutenant . He and his unit were sent to keep order at the 1891 shearers ' strike , and in June 1892 Tunbridge was promoted captain . In November 1898 he was promoted major and transferred to the Queensland Artillery Garrison Battery , serving in South Africa from 1900 and commanding the 3rd Mounted Infantry Contingent . He saw action at Elands River and Rhenoster Kop . He served with distinction and was mentioned in despatches , appointed Companion of the Order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medal with five clasps and promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel .

Appointed censor for the 3rd Military District in August 1914 , he was swiftly promoted to deputy chief censor and before the month was out returned to the military as a lieutenant-colonel in the Australian Imperial Force . Given command of the 1st Australian Division Ammunition Park ( Mechanical Transport ) , Tunbridge and his units arrived in England in February 1915 , where they were incorporated into the British Army as the 300th and 301st Mechanical Transport Companies and sent to France in July . Influential in various reorganisations of the mechanical transport units , Tunbridge was appointed to command the 1 Anzac Corps Ammunition Park on 25 April 1916 and following a reorganisation in January 1917 became senior mechanical operator of the 1 Anzac Corps .

4 Atlantic stargazer ( ' ' Uranoscopus scaber ' ' ) is a marine , subtropical fish of family Uranoscopidae . Its body is suited for living on the sea floor , and is one of few fish capable of bioelectrogenesis , or the ability to generate an electric charge . # Distribution and habitat # It is widespread along the Atlantic coast of Europe and Africa , is very common in the Mediterranean and Black Sea , and somewhat rare in the Bay of Biscay . It is a demersal fish , which lives in sandy or muddy sand sediments along the upper slope of the continental shelf , between depths of 14-400 meters . It is not an economically important fish , primarily caught as by-catch , but is ecologically important . # Description # Typical of stargazers , its body is somewhat dorso-ventrally flattened , lacks a swimbladder , and have been found as large as 35.0 centimeters in length , but is usually between 20-30 cm . Its head and jaws are rotated upward , and has very large eyes and mouth . Its body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots , with a lighter belly . It lives to about 5 or 6 years , and females are larger in size than males . # Biology # # Feeding # Like other stargazers , it is an ambush predator which lies buried under sand with only its eyes showing . It has a large mouth , with a small strip of skin protruding from its lower jaw , which it moves in and out rapidly to act as a lure for prey . When a prey item comes near , the fish lunges toward the prey using a specially adapted vertebral column to generate the force by bending 60 , which takes less than 30 milliseconds to engulf the prey . It feeds primarily on fish larvae and smaller fishes , such as gobies , picarels , and small crustaceans , but has also been known to eat molluscs , echinoderms , annelids , algae and plant material . # Reproduction # They can spawn between April and September , depending on the region , and produce pelagic eggs , about 2 millimeters in diameter . After hatching , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are slightly more common than females , but this can vary within local populations . # Electric organ # All species within the ' ' Uranoscopus ' ' genus , along with those in ' ' Astroscopus ' ' , have evolved electric organs , but lack receptor organs . These were both independently evolved , and are the only two genera within the order Perciformes to produce electric organ discharges ( EODs ) . The atlantic stargazer , like other bioelectrogenic stargazers , produces pulse-type EODs while feeding and when it is disturbed . The atlantic stargazer produces EODs with the electric organ , derived from sonic muscles . In other fishes , sonic muscles are used to produce sound by agitating the swim bladder . # References #

4 Perrinsville School is a historical site in Wayne County in Westland , Michigan . Perrinsville is a one room schoolhouse that is located on Warren Road and Cowan Road . What is now the city of Westland used to be called the Village of Perrinsville in the 1830s . The main residential streets , Perrin and Liberty are still there today and Perrinsville was first settled by Thomas Dickerson in 1831 . The Perrin brothers opened a sawmill in 1832 and several other business opened to help the village of Perrinsville reach peak activity in the 1850s. *The Perrinsville School Historical Marker says , Perrinsville began with a sawmill established by Abraham and Isaac Perrin around 1832 . During the next century three one-room schools served area children . The first , a wooden school , was erected in1833 on Marcus Swift farm . A second , larger one , was built on the William Osband farm in 1856 on land purchased from Isaac and Hannah Swift Perrin by Nankin District No. 2 , was the first brick school in the township .

Having suffered many changes over the years , including the removal of the teachers platform , the cupola , and the wainscoting , the school has been restored to its 1890s appearance by the city of Westland , which acquired it in 1990. *The Perrinsville one-room schoolroom was built in 1856 as a Greek Revival architecture style made with soft red , clay bricks that were made at a nearby brickyard . For eighty-one years , from 1856 to 1937 , the school was used for educating the boys and girls of Nankin . In 1937 , the school was closed and replaced by another one-room school called Nankin Mills , built by Henry Ford two and half miles away . # Village of Perrinsville # *The Perrinsville historical marker says , The village of Perrinsville was established as a small commercial center during the 1830s .

But a railroad built during this era bypassed Perrinville to the south ; in 1871 this railroad was intersected at what is now Wayne City by a rail line running from the north .

Absorbed by the city of Westland in 1966 , one of Perrinsvilles residential streets , a school , and a store still exist. *The American Local History Network of Michigan has a website that has a list of Wayne county townships/communities that do not exist anymore , Perrinsville is listed on it and it says that the name was changed to Pikes Peak December 21 , 1882 , and that it was in operation until August 30 , 1902 .

4 In Riemannian geometry , a field of mathematics , Preissman 's theorem is a statement that restricts the possible topology of a negatively curved compact Riemannian manifold ' ' M ' ' . Specifically , the theorem states that every non-trivial abelian subgroup of the fundamental group of ' ' M ' ' must be isomorphic to the additive group of integers , Z . <ref> citation For instance , a compact surface of genus two admits a Riemannian metric of curvature equal to &amp;minus ; 1 ( see the uniformization theorem ) . The fundamental group of such a surface is isomorphic to the free group on two letters . Indeed , the only abelian subgroups of this group are isomorphic to Z . A corollary of Preissman 's theorem is that the ' ' n ' ' -dimensional torus , where ' ' n ' ' is at least two , admits no Riemannian metric of negative sectional curvature .

4 Cathy Ames is a fictional character and the main antagonist in John Steinbeck 's Pulitzer Prize winning novel ' ' East of Eden ' ' . She is the wife of main protagonist Adam Trask , and the mother of his twin sons , Caleb and Aron . Beneath her charming , attractive facade , she is an evil woman who manipulates and destroys people for her own amusement and profit . Steinbeck characterizes her as a psychic monster with a malformed soul . # Concept and creation # In 1951 , Steinbeck wrote a series of letters , known as ' ' The Journal of a Novel : The East of Eden Letters ' ' , to his editor Pascal Covici during the process of writing ' ' East of Eden ' ' . On March 26 , Steinbeck first mentions Cathy to Covici : This is a woman and you must know her ; know her completely because she is a tremendously powerful force in the book . The majority of these letters demonstrate that Steinbeck was most fascinated with Cathys character , mentioning once that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . # Physical description # Steinbeck depicts Cathy as small-breasted , delicate , blonde and beautiful , with oil-soaked skin that gives her a pearly-light and a sense of allurement . Her beauty fools most of the people she encounters , but a few characters detect her true nature by looking into her eyes , which Steinbeck describes as cold and emotionless ; Samuel Hamilton , a supporting character in the novel , takes note that the eyes of Cathy had no message , no communicationthey were not human eyes . As the novel progresses , Cathy becomes increasingly less attractive . She develops crippling arthritis in her hands , and by the end of the novel she is described as a sick ghost . # Appearances in the novel ' ' East of Eden ' ' # # Part 1 # Throughout Cathys childhood , she pointedly causes harm to anyone who holds a relationship with her . She uses her precocious sexuality to manipulate and destroy men ; she frames two young boys for attempting to rape her , and drives her nave Latin professor to commit suicide by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she learns to mimic emotions she is incapable of feeling , an ability she uses to con adults into giving her what she wants . She attempts to run away once , at 16 , to Boston , but her father tracks her down and reluctantly whips her as punishment . Afterwards she is a model student , and even certifies to become a school teacher . Consequently , her parents trust her enough to give her the combination to the family safe . Soon afterward , she robs the safe and burns down her family home while her parents are trapped inside , killing them . She then runs away from her hometown and entrances a whoremaster by the name of Mr. Edwards . The two become lovers for a time , until Mr. Edwards begins to suspect she is being dishonest with him , particularly after she gets drunk and tells him she despises him . He hires a detective who discovers a newspaper story about the death of Cathy 's parents and her mysterious disappearance . Finally fed up , Mr. Edwards gives her a savage beating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescued by Adam Trask and his brother Charles . As Adam nurses Cathy back to health , he succumbs to her beauty and resolves to marry her . Cathy accepts his proposal in order to gain protection from Mr. Edwards . Charles sees through her and tries to warn his lovestruck brother , who refuses to listen . Part one ends with Cathy drugging Adam into a deep sleep and then having sex with Charles . # Part 2 # After moving to California with Adam , Cathy becomes pregnant ( the novel is ambiguous as to whether by Charles or Adam ) and in turn attempts a primitive abortion on herself with a knitting needle . She fails , however , and decides to carry on with the pregnancy . Though she warns Adam that she plans to leave as soon as she is able , he brushes this off as homesickness . She leaves her family a few weeks after giving birth to twin sons , and shoots Adam in the shoulder when he tries to stop her . Cathy then changes her name to Kate Albey and joins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Faye , who eventually makes her new charge the main beneficiary in her will . Kate begins secretly poisoning Faye , and finally kills her by overdosing her on pain medication . She then assumes full ownership of the whorehouse , which she turns into a den of sexual sadism . # Part 3 # The plot steers away from Kates life for some years , until her husband , Adam , visits her at the whorehouse . She reveals her motives for the first time , admitting that , from a young age , she took pleasure in using people : I could make them do whatever I wantedwhen I was half-grown I made a man kill himself . She then shows Adam pictures of multiple public figures , including a Congressman and a priest , who visit the whorehouse , and denounces the entire human race as a pack of hypocrites ; she tells Adam that shed rather be a dog than a human . Cathy attempts to seduce Adam , but he resists her temptations , which infuriates her . Later on , Adam returns to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently died . She is confused as to why Adam would show her any kindness , and refuses to believe in the sincerity of his actions . Adam finally sees Kate for what she is and pities her , telling her : And the men who come to you here with their ugliness , the men in the pictures -- you do nt believe those men could have goodness or beauty in them . You see only one side , and you think -- more than that , youre sure -- thats all there is. # Part 4 # Years later , her son Cal visits her . Cals goodness makes Kate uncomfortable , especially when he states his love for his father , Adam : a curious spasm shook Kate -- an aching twist tore in her chest . After a brief conversation , Cal leaves , telling Kate that she is simply afraid . Soon , the truth of Fayes murder starts to surface and Kate fears being found out . She covers up the truth by framing her employees Joe and Ethel , the only people who know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will to live , especially when she is visited by her second son Aron , who is disgusted by her . Literary critic Sarah Aguiar notes that this incident causes Kate to feel remorse for the first time . She signs over all her possessions to Aron , not Cal . She then commits suicide by taking a lethal dose of morphine . # Archetypes # # The Devil # One of the main characteristics of ' ' East of Eden ' ' is the prevalent allegory with the Bible and the battle between good and evil . In a letter to family friend Allen Ludden , Steinbeck states that Kate is a total representative of Satan . As noted by John Timmerman , Steinbeck demonstrates the devil allegory through repeated snake-like imagery used to describe Cathy . In one instance in the novel , Samuel Hamilton observes that when Cathy swallowed , her tongue flicked around her lipsthe eyes were flat and the mouth with its small up-curve at the corners was carven , giving a serpentine air to Cathys demeanor. # Pandora # Cathy also takes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Zeus gave Pandora a box and commanded her not to open it . She ultimately disobeys and when she opens the box , she sets loose evil into the world . In an academic article from the ' ' The Explicator ' ' , Rebecca Barnes analyzes that Cathy is like Pandora in that her broken box brings disaster wherever she goes . In the novel Cathy destroys every life she touches : she murders her parents , drives her Latin teacher to commit suicide , shoots her husband , poisons her benefactress , and sadistically abuses ( and later blackmails ) countless men as a prostitute . # Psychoanalysis # In Stephen Georges article The Emotional Content of Cruelty , he writes that Cathy embodies hatred and fear , which he argues are the main motivators behind human cruelty . He writes that Cathy fears losing control in any way ; for example , she refuses to drink because alcohol brings out her true nature . Her method of controlling her environment comes in the form of paranoia , which is manifested by her desire to manipulate men sexually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that she feels superior to those she manipulates . In her essay No Sanctuary , Sarah Aguiar writes that Cathy 's actions are due to a perversion of human virtues such as compassion and love . Aguiar explains this deficiency is due to Cathy 's child-like egocentricitythe desperate needto protect herself at all costs . Steinbeck further comments in his ' ' East of Eden ' ' letters that Cathy is in part evil because her life is one of revenge on other people because of a vague feeling of her own lack. # Film adaptations # Actress Jo Van Fleet won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Cathy Ames in the 1955 film adaptation of ' ' East of Eden ' ' . In 1982 , Jane Seymour received a Best Actress Golden Globe award for her portrayal of Cathy Ames in the ABC mini-series adaptation of ' ' East of Eden ' ' . In an interview with Oprah Winfrey , Seymour commented that there is nothing greater than playing evil incarnate . It is wonderful ! It is an amazing experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have no idea you know , you ca n't even imagine it . Academy Award winning actress Jennifer Lawrence will play Cathy Ames in the upcoming adaptation of ' ' East of Eden ' ' directed by Gary Ross .

4 Joan Sterndale-Bennett ( 5 March 1914 27 March 1996 ) was a British stage and film actress , best known as a character comedienne for her work at the Players ' Theatre in London . # Career # Born into a musical family , her father Thomas Case Sterndale Bennett was a songwriter , entertainer and a grandson of the composer William Sterndale Bennett . Her mother Christine Bywater ( d 1931 ) was a professional oratorio singer . After studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art her first professional engagement was in 1933 in Strange Orchestra at Worthing before moving to London 's West End . In 1938 she joined the Players Theatre which was to be the start of a forty year association at the home of traditional music hall in London and which provided her with a platform to excel in that special direct relationship between the performer and audiences .

4 ' ' Sicyases sanguineus ' ' is a species of amphibious marine clingfish in the family Gobiesocidae . It lives in subtropical marine environments of the Southeast Pacific in Chile . Locally , it is known as ' ' ' ' ( literally , frog-fish ) . It is an exceptionally large clingfish that can live below the cool and well-aerated surf and above water on exposed rocks . # Habitat # The fish is characteristic of vertical rock walls in the middle and upper rocky intertidal community along the exposed coasts of western South America , ranging from southern Peru to southern Chile . Its niche is unique , with no known parallel development in other rocky intertidal communities . The most likely determinants of the distribution of ' ' Sicyases sanguineus ' ' are areas where vertical rocky shorelines encounter ocean swells and ample benthic prey ( mainly barnacles , mussels and certain algae ) . ' ' Sicyases sanguineus ' ' attaches by means of a large disc formed of the fused and highly modified pelvic fins , bearing small and flattened dermal papillae . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure the clingfish to the rock . # Behavior # When young , ' ' S. sanguineus ' ' is gregarious and often congregates on walls . They are alert and can detect moving objects over distances from 10-15 m . However , adults are quiescent and cluster on exposed rocks often well above water level . They have also been seen in boulder fields in Pozo Toyo and Antofagasta Bay . # Feeding # ' ' Sicyases sanguineus ' ' use their teeth for feeding . The most common way to feed is for the fish to connect itself to a flat smooth surface with its ventral sucker . It then repeatedly swings its head in a small arc , raking its teeth downward in strokes . They have a typical buck tooth appearance , with a series of 4 long , incisor like teeth protruding beyond the lips of the upper jaw , complemented by four shorter chisel-like teeth on the lower jaw . A second mode in which ' ' Sicyases sanguineus ' ' feed is to insert its teeth on the limpets shell and then twist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anteriorly . The major prey categories include three plant and three animal phyla which reside in the intertidal zone .

During the American Revolutionary War he led a battalion of converged British grenadiers while a lieutenant colonel . He was wounded at Long Island during the New York and New Jersey Campaign in 1776 . He led a temporary brigade at Assunpink Creek . In the Philadelphia Campaign of 1777 he led a grenadier battalion at both Brandywine and Germantown . He was killed leading his soldiers at the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778. # Early career # Born on 13 July 1740 , Monckton was the fourth son of John Monckton , 1st Viscount Galway , although the second by his second wife , Jane Westenra of Rathleagh , Queen 's County , Ireland . His older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high ranking general officer in the British army , as later did his nephew , Henry , the son of his brother Edward Monckton , a nabob and Member of Parliament . Monckton 's only sister , Mary , was a famous blue-stocking and later presided over an important literary and political salon . Monckton commanded the 45th Foot from 25 July 1771 until 1772 . He was wounded at the Battle of Long Island on 22 August 1776 while leading the 1st Grenadier Battalion in the army of Sir William Howe with the rank of lieutenant colonel . At time of the Battle of Trenton on 26 December 1776 , he served as acting commander of Major General James Robertson 's 1st British Brigade at New York City . After Trenton disaster , he took command of an ' ' ad hoc ' ' brigade consisting of William Medows ' 1st Grenadier Battalion , his own 2nd Grenadier Battalion , and James Ogilvie 's 2nd Guards Battalion . Leading this force , he went to New Jersey with Lord Charles Cornwallis and fought at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington outmaneuvered the British and defeated them at the Battle of Princeton . In the aftermath , Cornwallis made a rapid retreat to his base at New Brunswick , New Jersey . # Philadelphia Campaign # At the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September 1777 , Monckton led the 2nd Grenadier Battalion , which was formed from 15 grenadier companies taken from the regiments of foot . As the British advanced south from Osborne 's Hill , the left flank of the 2nd Grenadiers touched the Birmingham road while the 1st Grenadiers deployed on their right . The battalion struck Thomas Conway 's 3rd Pennsylvania Brigade , driving it back . Near sunset , the advancing 2nd Grenadiers walked into a trap set by George Weedon 's fresh Virginia brigade , which was deployed on a reverse slope with its right flank thrown forward so as to take the British line in enfilade . Once he found his troops in a tight spot , Monckton asked Hessian Captain Johann von Ewald to ride back and summon reinforcements . Ewald located James Agnew who brought his 4th Brigade up on Monckton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally dislodged the Americans as darkness fell , but not before the 64th Foot lost 47 casualties . The grenadiers also suffered serious losses at Brandywine . Of the 10 British officers killed in the engagement , seven were from the two grenadier battalions , and an additional seven grenadier officers were wounded , including Medows , shot in the arm . On 26 September 1777 , the British army marched into the rebel capital of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . One witness remembered Monckton leading both British grenadier battalions . His circle of friends among the British officers included Sir George Osborn , 4th Baronet , William Harcourt , Richard FitzPatrick , and Sir John Wrottesley , 8th Baronet . On 4 October the Battle of Germantown was fought . Monckton double-timed his grenadiers from their barracks in Philadelphia to the field of action . On the way they passed the slower-moving Hessian grenadiers . Led by Cornwallis , the grenadiers arrived just as the American attack collapsed . They led the pursuit up Germantown Road as far as Chestnut Hill . # Death at Monmouth # In March 1778 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st Viscount Sackville sent orders permitting the evacuation of Philadelphia . Worried about being trapped in the Delaware River by a French fleet , the new British commander Henry Clinton determined to move most of his army to New York by land . The naval transports were packed with most of the army 's women and children , 3,000 loyalist civilians , sick soldiers , and the unreliable Ansbach-Bayreuth mercenaries . The transports set sail early on 18 June 1778 . That day , Philadelphia was abandoned and Clinton 's army marched east to Haddonfield , New Jersey . From there Clinton 's army marched in a northeasterly direction via Mount Holly , Bordentown , Allentown , and Imlaystown . Wilhelm von Knyphausen 's leading division reached Monmouth Court House on 26 June to be joined shortly by Cornwallis ' division . After his army rested on the 26th and 27th , Clinton planned to move northeast to Sandy Hook where naval transports would take his army to New York . Meanwhile , Washington moved his army northeast from Valley Forge , Pennsylvania and crossed the Delaware at Coryell 's Ferry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Jersey and moved east to intercept Clinton . After some hesitation , Washington appointed his second-in-command , Charles Lee to lead his advance guard . At 4:00 AM on 28 June 1778 , Knyphausen 's division began its march from Monmouth Court House , followed at 8:00 AM by Cornwallis ' division . Lee failed to scout the terrain and told his subordinates that he had no plan of battle other than to act according to circumstances . He only began moving forward at 7:00 AM with 5,000 troops and 10 cannons . When Lee arrived near the British positions , Clinton turned back to assist his rear guard with strong forces , including the two grenadier battalions . After some attacks miscarried , Lee 's division retreated with Clinton in pursuit . At length , Lee 's withdrawing troops met Washington 's main body moving forward . Washington relieved Lee of command , but apparently relented and allowed Lee to cobble together a defensive line with the troops at hand . He placed Varnum 's Brigade , then under the command of Jeremiah Olney behind a hedgerow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Olney 's left . Farther to the left , Anthony Wayne directed soldiers led by Walter Stewart and Nathaniel Ramsey into some woods . Lee 's chief of artillery , Eleazer Oswald placed two cannons on Olney 's right and two more in support of Wayne 's troops . Stewart and Ramsey ambushed the 1st Guards Battalion as it passed by . Though their commander Colonel Henry Trelawney and 40 men were hit , the Brigade of Guards and two companies of the 1st Grenadier Battalion rushed the woods . In a hard-fought action , the Americans were flushed from the trees and set upon by the 16th Light Dragoons in the open . Stewart was wounded and Ramsey wounded and captured as their commands raced to cross a bridge to the west side of the ravine . The 16th Light Dragoons tried to charge the hedgerow but Olney 's men repulsed them with a blast of gunfire . Clinton personally led forward the 2nd Grenadiers and one wing of the 1st Grenadiers , calling out , Charge , grenadiers , never heed forming . Case shot from Oswald 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m , but they stormed the hedgerow anyway , driving back Olney 's men . During the desperate action , Washington 's chief of artillery Henry Knox ordered Oswald to pull back . Covered by Olney 's brigade , he managed to get across the bridge without losing any guns . The action was so chaotic that a party of 16 grenadiers found themselves amid Olney 's brigade , but the Americans were so focused on getting away that they paid no attention to their enemies . Sometime during the action at the hedgerow , a British officer saw Monckton fall , struck by grape shot . He detailed some of his soldiers to retrieve his commander , but apparently this was not done . After the battle some men of the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment found Monckton . The mortally wounded officer was taken to the Old Tennent Church where he died the same day . Oddly , Clinton did not mention Monckton in his report of the battle . However , Hessian Adjutant General Carl Leopold Baurmeister wrote , Colonel Monckton was killed , a great loss indeed . Monckton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey . The inscription on his grave marker reads , # Lt. Col. Henry Monckton who on the plains of Monmouth 28 June 1778 sealed with his life his duty and devotion to his king and country . This memorial erected by Samuel Fryer whose father a subject of Great Britain sleeps in an unknown grave . # Because he was found by men of the 1st Pennsylvania , a legend grew up that Monckton was killed while attacking that regiment late in the battle . It was supposed that they not only recovered his body but the colors of his regiment . In fact , the grenadier battalions carried no colors and Monckton fell around noon . In one account , Monckton 's mortal wounding and the loss of the colors came late in the day at the hands of Anthony Wayne 's troops in front of Washington 's main position . In another account , Monckton exhorted his men before the fatal attack saying , On to the day ! Meanwhile , on the American side , Wayne urged his soldiers , Steady ! Steady boys !

514 ' ' Islay ' ' is a novel by author Douglas Bullard . It is the first and possibly the only novel by a Deaf American to focus on Deaf culture ( Peters 122 ) . ' ' Islay ' ' was published in 1986 by T.J. PUBLISHERS , INC. located in Silver Spring , Maryland . The novel tells the story of the protagonist Lyson Sulla , who has a goal of becoming Governor of the State of Islay and making it a state by and for Deaf people . # About the Author # Douglass Bullard ( 19372005 ) , was a graduate of Gallaudet College . He grew up in the Deep South and traveled around the world as well as lived in many different places . He was an Alaskan geologist and is the author of several novels . ' ' Islay ' ' , however , is the only work of his that was published . He was the president of the Florida Association of the Deaf for some time . # Writing Style # ' ' Islay ' ' is written an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English , while there is a written gloss form of American Sign Language that is used for dialogue between characters . This gloss form of ASL is written in italics and is neither truly English nor truly ASL . An example of this gloss form , coming from Lyson about his desire for a homeland for the Deaf is as follows : ' ' You know that Laurent Clerc had same dream . Himself greatest deaf in history , started Golden Age for deaf there France . Then brought sign here America ; almost started new Golden Age for us deaf , but hearing oralism frustrated him , broke up deaf cooperation and almost destroyed Sign Language . That why Clerc liked idea for deaf gathering into one state where deaf itself normal ! ' ' ( 6-7 ) . If the reader is a signer of ASL , they can see that the way this gloss form is written shows word order of ASL signs . However , this is not an accurate portrayal of ASL and the beauty and visual aspect of the language are not done justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the differences between spoken English and signed language . There are also parts of the novel written in bold capital letters that are used to describe conversations through a TTY . An example of this writing form is as follows : MARY HERE . WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN Q. I WAITED SINCE SIX . DISGUSTED GA . ( 67 ) . When using a TTY , the ' Q ' after a sentence makes it a question . ' GA ' means go ahead , which informs the person on the other line that you are done talking and they can type their response . For some , understanding the varying written forms within ' ' Islay ' ' is confusing and hard to understand . If one has a background in American Sign Language and is familiar with TTYs , they will more easily understand the glossed form of ASL and the TTY text . # Title Meaning # When the book was first released , there was much talk about what the title meant . Some people speculated it was a mix of the finger spelled acronyms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ASL ) while others hypothesized it was derived from island . Bullard actually came across the word in the dictionary , liked how it sounded , and decided to use it - then later flew to the island Islay off the coast of Scotland only to discover that the real island closely resembled his fictional one ( Peters 124 ) . # Plot Summary # The book has three sections , titled Strings , Drums , and Cymbals . These three sections document Lysons journey to make Islay a Deaf state . He comes across many problems along the way , and is ridiculed by some . Others accuse him of being a peddler and he is misunderstood by many . His wife , in the beginning of the novel is embarrassed by his dream and keeps Lyson behind lock and key when he is working on his project . She does not want her friends to know about what he is doing and does everything in her power to keep it a secret . In the first section , Strings , the books protagonist Lyson Sulla is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Deaf people . He is learning about the state Islay , and how it could work for what he is envisioning . He receives financial support from his in-laws so that he can move to Islay . Once there , he spends a weeks time looking over the state , seeing how it will work for him , and meeting with public officials . He is pleased with what he sees in Islay and believes that it will work for what he plans . He moves his wife , Mary out to Islay with him . Once they are moved into a large home , they throw a big party . The second section , Drums documents Lysons travels to recruit other Deaf people to move to Islay . He meets many Deaf people along the way and is able to convince many well-established Deaf people to move to Islay . He also has a few misunderstandings along the way when people misunderstand what his intentions and meanings are . In the last section , Cymbals , many Deaf people move their families to Islay and open businesses . Lyson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate fraud . However , he gets out of this predicament . Those who moved to Islay register to vote , so as to help Lyson become Governor . The election is a rough experience for Lyson , but in the end he wins , becoming Governor of Islay.

4 The Early 2012 Hong Kong protests were a series of protests by residents of Hong Kong against Chinese Peking University professor Kong Qingdong , who had made televised remarks suggesting that many Hong Kong people were disloyal to China and still harboured a colonial mentality . Kong was responding to the release of a survey finding that Hong Kong people feel increasingly separate from , and superior to , Mainland Chinese people . Anti-Mainland Chinese sentiment in Hong Kong is growing because of the perception that Mainland Chinese mothers are flocking to Hong Kong to give birth . About 150 people gathered at the Chinese liaison office on January 22 in order to protest Kong 's remarks . And since Leung Chun-ying elected and inaugurated as Chief Executive of Hong Kong , protests of anti-government of Hong Kong SAR and central government increases ongoing . # Background # # Cultural identity # Since 1997 , University of Hong Kong professor Robert Chung ( ) had been regularly conducting surveys on how residents in Hong Kong view their own identity . In December 2011 , Chung 's poll showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only 34% thought of the same way of being Chinese first . This is the highest ratio of those who consider themselves primarily as Hong Kong residents since the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 . After Chung published his results , two pro-Beijing newspapers in Hong Kong , ' ' Wen Wei Po ' ' and ' ' Ta Kung Pao ' ' alleged that Chung was a political fraudster with evil intentions to incite people to deny they are Chinese . One pro-Beijing columnist asked whether Chung 's actions are subversive , and whether his scholarship is a slave of political bribery . Chung rejected the charges of bias and released a statement that the Cultural Revolution-style curses and defamations are not conducive to the building of Chinese national identity among Hong Kong people . Another professor targeted was Dixon Sing ( ) of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology . In December 2011 Pro-Beijing media said he was an anti-China Western trained vicious dog because he gave interviews to Falun Gong media . But his real issue may have been to support the 2010 Five Constituencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released to ask the university to fire him . The Communist party officials see both professors as a connection between pro-democracy movements and the way HK people see themselves . The Students ' union have since come out to protect professor Sing in a public statement about the One Country , Two Systems being violated . They believe that regardless of pro-establishment or pro-democratic views , the views need to be respected in order for academic freedom to exist . # Influx of birth tourism # On 1 January 2012 a protest was held by more than 1,500 pregnant women and mothers with strollers against the number of Mainland Chinese mothers giving birth in the city . In 2001 , the Court of Final Appeal ruled in ' ' Director of Immigration v. Chong Fung Yuen ' ' that Hong Kong-born children of Chinese citizens were entitled to the right of abode in Hong Kong even if their parents had entered the territory as tourists . This ruling sparked a sharp rise in the number of Mainland Chinese mothers coming to Hong Kong to give birth . Hong Kong hospitals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 2011 nearly half of all babies born in Hong Kong ( 38,043 out of 80,131 ) were born to Mainland Chinese mothers aiming for their children to get the right of abode so they could obtain education in Hong Kong . Hong Kong in general has one of the world 's lowest birth rates . The hospital systems are stressed . Nurses in the region have accused the city 's government of being incompetent and said Hong Kong residents should be prioritised over non-locals . For 2012 the Hong Kong government reduced the quota for number of Mainland Chinese women allowed to give birth in public hospitals . The quota call was made after doctors themselves made a rare public call to pressure the government to put a stop on the number of babies allowed as resources were stretched too thin . The cap is now set at 3,400 for public and 31,000 for private hospitals . Chief Executive Donald Tsang announced a four point plan to hold back the wave of Mainland Chinese women . Heavy charges are imposed on non-locals who turn up at emergency stops to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources for border checks . Local authorities will crack down on people who assist women enter the territories . More raids will be done on unlicensed pregnant women hotels . About HK$6.6 million of public hospitals ' bad debt in 2010-11 was from non-local mothers not paying their bills . # Property investment # Many Hong Kong citizens blame wealthy Mainland Chinese for driving property prices beyond the reach of local citizens . In 2011 Mainland Chinese purchased a third of all residential flats in Hong Kong , according to Nomura research . Home prices also rose as much as 70% since 2009. # Incident # # Eating while on MTR controversy # In January 2012 , Ken Wai , a Hong Kong passenger , asked a Mainland Chinese woman and her child to stop eating on an MTR subway in Mandarin Chinese on a train bound for Mong Kok East Station . Eating and drinking is not allowed on the MTR . While the kid stopped eating , the mother accused him of making trouble and laughed at his bad Mandarin Chinese . This infuriated Mr. Wai who started the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to stop the train , and ask both parties to get off the train to solve disputes . On 18 January Mr. Wai conducted an interview with Xinhua News Agency on the issue and expressed his anger . # Kong Qingdong 's remarks # A harsh public comment on followed this incident by the controversial professor Kong Qingdong from Peking University who is known for his nationalist views and use of profanity . He responded publicly You Hongkongers are Chinese , right ? But as I know , many Hongkongers do n't think they are Chinese . They claim that we are Hongkongers , you are Chinese . They are bastards . Those kinds of people used to be running dogs for the British colonialists . And until now , you Hongkongers are still dogs . You are n't human . Kong then claimed that Hong Kong citizens had failed to accept their responsibility to speak the real Chinese language Mandarin Chinese because of the residues of colonialism . He then threatened If Hongkongers keep discriminating against mainlanders Mainland Chinese in that way , then we wo n't provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And asked Can Hongkongers still survive ? Go to seek help from your British daddy . After exposure by the media , however , Kong Qingdong claimed that he only made the remarks for the Hong Kong peoples benefit , and that he only called some people dogs . According to ' ' Ming Pao ' ' , Kong claimed that normal people , educated people should all understand what he meant , and that he thinks every place has some people who are dogs . Some Beijing people are dogs . If someone really says that all Hong Kong people are dogs , then I agree , that person should apologize . Since the only party claiming that Hong Kong people are dogs is ' ' Southern Daily ' ' . I demand that they apologize to both the Hong Kong people and me ! The online video network that published Kongs remarks later claimed that Kongs views do not represent the networks . # Protests # Many Hong Kong citizens were infuriated by his remarks , and Hong Kong 's ' ' Open ' ' magazine openly asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as suggesting that the Communist Party of China has been supporting Kong Qingdong behind the scene . Petitions for expelling Kong from Peking University , which was previously called for when he rejected the ' ' Southern Weekly ' ' interview with an expression of profanity , was also renewed . On 22 January 2012 , about 150 protesters gathered at the Liaison Office to protest against Kong Qingdong 's statement . People brought their pet dogs and carried signs saying We are not dogs . Some protesters claimed that Hong Kongers dislike the Communist Party precisely because the Party had , in their views , deformed Chinese culture and tradition . # Reaction # # Kong Qingdong # Kong criticized the protest as an attempt to suppress ( his ) freedom of speech through government action . Chinese reaction to Kongs remarks had been divided ; while some criticized his insult on the Hong Kong people , others have expressed support for Kong . # Hong Kong electoral candidates # Both running candidates for the next Chief executives position , Henry Tang and Leung Chun-ying have come out to complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying professor Kong Qingdong needs to be responsible for his own statement and that Hong Kong citizens are not dogs . He emphasized this is how Hong Kong citizens deal with each other in a free society . Leung Chun-ying responded by saying that Kong 's statement did not actually reflect the views of Mainland Chinese . He added that this is part of the Hong Kong spirit to respect the law , and that professor Kong Qingdong should not be overreacting. # Other notable response # * The prominent Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei complained about Peking University 's tolerance of Kong Qingdong 's behavior , calling Peking University a nest of turtles . * Susan Tse , a Hong Kong opera actress and a fellow descendant of Confucius , criticized Kong Qingdong 's lack of tolerance and respect of the Hong Kong people . Tse further suggested that Kong should apologize to the Hong Kong people . * The Chinese scholar and television personality Yi Zhongtian criticized Kong 's remarks , calling Kong 's characterization of speakers of non-Mandarin Chinese dialects as bastards an affront to thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yi would rather be a bastard than agree with Kong . * The Hong Kong actor Anthony Wong also rebuked Kong 's remarks , suggesting that if the Hong Kong people are dogs , then Kong Qingdong is a blood relative of dogs . * An analysis was done by yzzk ( Asia magazine ) , who gave many examples of popular YouTube links showing Mainland Chinese misbehaving every day in Hong Kong causing anger . It also highlight many Chinese events such as fight for democracy during the 1989 protest , help with activists in need , help with territorial dispute ( Diaoyutai islands ) , disaster relief ( 2008 Sichuan earthquake ) and many more events that HK citizens participated in and were overlooked . * Jack So , former MTR chairman and CPPCC member who was born in Taiwan , said We are all the same , we are all Chinese with the same surnames . # Advertisement controversy # # Anti-Chinese advertisements # Members of the Hong Kong Golden Forum raised more than HK$100,000 to purchase a full-page advertisement in ' ' Apple Daily ' ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured a giant locust overlooking the city skyline of Hong Kong . Locusts stereotypically represent Mainland Chinese . The ad makes the statement Would you like to see Hong Kong spend HK$1 million every 18 minutes on the children of non-Hong Kongers ? Hong Kongers have had enough ! We demand the unlimited infiltration of Mainland Chinese couples into Hong Kong . The advertisement also employs the derogative term double illegitimacy ( ) , which refers to residents of Hong Kong with both parents of illegal status within the territory . Protesters also argued against Hong Kong Basic Law Article 24 , although Rita Fan have already said these newborns do not qualify for right of abode . Hong Kong protesters also launched anti-Mainland Chinese groups on Facebook that reached high popularity , prompting local media to refer to it as an Anti-Locusts campaign . At least one entry on Sina microblog has been reposted 97,000 times and received 30,000 comments according to the ' ' Global Times ' ' . The Hong Kong Equal Opportunities Commission expressed concern over the full-page advertisement ; Chairman Lam Woon-kwong said that vilifying remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rational debate . The Communist party has long been known for ignoring pro-Democracy groups and denying certain citizens Home Return Permits and other rights . # Mainland Chinese response # Mainland Chinese microblogs launched a retaliatory advertisement against the locust slur , claiming that if it was n't the mainland Chinese treating you like a son , you would have died long ago . We must not allow this son ( Hong Kong ) to ride on our shoulders anymore . Let 's temporarily cut off the son 's water , electricity and food ! # Copycat advertisement : Shanghai grassroot against other Mainland Chinese response # A similarly duplicate ad by shanghai grassroots reused the same picture posted from the HK golden forum , but the words were changed . This copycat ad claims 4 billion RMB is spent each year to subsidize non-locals in Shanghai . In Shanghainese dialect it declares Shanghainese have had enough . Because you have come for the gold rush , we have to receive 17,566,700 outsiders . # Additional controversy # # Democracy wall # Around 7 Feb , at the Democracy wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscribing the words in Chinese characters : Anti-Locusts ( ) . The case have been under investigation . Some students believe this type of vandalism on the democracy wall is just a response to Mainland Chinese society not tolerating democracy . # Tension extends to university # The tension between HK and Mainland China has extended to universities where between 2010 to 2011 Mainland Chinese students were granted 2/3 of the scholarships . There were limited resources available to begin with , now these HK citizens have to compete with Mainland Chinese for education , scholarships and jobs post study . Chinese University of Hong Kong vice Chancellor Joseph Sung have recognized the uneasiness about the situation . The cultural differences also add to the tension where many students from HK and Mainland China ca n't live together in some campuses . # Tension extends to Singapore # A Mainland Chinese student Sun Xu ( ) from Jiangsu province under Chinese government scholarship at the National University of Singapore wrote a message in Singapore there are more dogs than humans on internet forums . Sun Xu faced disciplinary actions and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment is said to be influenced by Kong Qingdong . While the comment has raised many issues , some people have agreed . A comment followed by a Mr. Lin who said Singaporeans are Descendants of Yan and Yellow Emperor who bleed Chinese blood . There is no need to rename a Chinese into a Singaporean. # Conflict between Hong Kong and Chinese reporters # On 10 March 2012 , a press conference on the issue of Mainland Chinese mothers giving birth in Hong Kong was held by Guangdong governor Zhu Xiaodan . As the conference was about to end , RTHK reporter Chan Liu-ling asked for Hong Kong reporters to be given a chance to ask questions . Instead the host let reporter Lu Hong-chao from Hong Kong Commercial Daily ( owned by Shenzhen Press Group ) ask the last question . As Lu is a Mainland Chinese , some Hong Kong reporters were unhappy and said He is n't from Hong Kong . After the press conference , a fight broke out between Lu and TVB reporter Cheng Sze-ting . Lu who thought that Cheng made the comment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalist pass from her chest . When Lu Hong-chao attempted to leave , Cheng Sze-ting , Chan Miu-ling and other Hong Kong reporters surrounded him and requested an apology . At the time other Mainland Chinese reporters joined the quarrel and questioned whether Cheng was discriminating against Mainland Chinese , despite the Mainland Chinese host of the press conference host picking on Mainland Chinese during the Q&amp;A session .

4 The Willem River or Willems River was named during the voyage of the Dutch East India Company ( Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie , or VOC ) ship ' ' Mauritius ' ' in 1618 , under the command of Supercargo Willem Janszoon and captained by Lenaert Jacobszoon , and is one of the few features named on a nautical chart made in 1627 . From that information Willems River would almost certainly have been named after Supercargo , Willem Janszoon , the Commander of the ship ' ' Mauritius ' ' . Janszoon was captain of the Duyfken in 1605-1606 , when part of the Gulf of Carpentaria was mapped , during the earliest documented visit to Australia by a vessel from the Netherlands . ' ' Caert va n't Landt van d'Eendracht ' ' ( Chart of the Land of Eendracht ) is a 1627 chart made by Hessel Gerritsz and is one of the earliest charts showing the coastline of Western Australia . The Willems River is located to the extreme left ( north ) end of the coastline on the chart and a closer view is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is believed that the Willems River of 1618 is the Ashburton River ( Western Australia ) . cite journal The chart shows ' ' Willems revier , besocht by ' t volck van ' t Schip Mauritius in Iulius A 1618 ' ' ( Willem 's River , visited by the crew of the ship ' ' Mauritius ' ' in July 1618 ) . The detail of the rivers position on the chart , backs up the claim that this is the Ashburton River , which , being at 21 degrees 40 minutes south and 114 degrees 56 east , is almost exactly the latitude shown on the chart . The chart is oriented with north to the left , showing lines of latitude from 20th parallel south to the 35th parallel south at the base of the map . The lines of latitude appear to be very accurate , matching closely known features through the length of the chart . Other factors to back up that this is the Ashburton river is that it takes almost a 90 degree turn north-east , once in the mouth , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river mouth in reality is of the same shape as shown on the chart . # 1627 chart accuracy # A note on the chart 's accuracy is given by the author Heeres in 1899 , from the following excerpt . # The 1627 chart is specially interesting . Gerritsz. , at the time cartographer in ordinary to the E.I.C. , has put together this chart of the Landt van d'Eendracht from the journals and drawings of the Steersmen , which means that he availed himself of authentic data *** . He acquitted himself of the task to admiration , and has given a very lucid survey of the ( accidental ) discoveries made by the Dutch on the west-coast of Australia . In this chart of 1627 the Land of d'Eendracht takes up a good deal of space . To the north it is found bounded by the Willemsrivier , discovered in July 1618 by the ship Mauritius , commanded by Willem Janszoon **** . According to the chart this river is in about 21 45 ' S. Lat. , but there are no reliable data concerning this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not use all the data then available . Thus , for instance , he left unused those furnished by the Zeewolf ( No . VIII , pp. 10 ff . below ) , and those of the ship Leiden ( No . XV , p. 49 ) . <br/> <br/> **** See the Documents under No IX ( pp. 12f . ) . # What Heeres means by the sentence , ' ' According to the chart this river is in about 21 45 ' S. Lat. , but there are no reliable data concerning this point , ' ' is that in 1899 they had no reliable information about exactly what was at that latitude . # ' ' Mauritius ' ' at North West Cape # On 31 July 1618 , the ' ' Mauritius ' ' reached North West Cape ( west of Exmouth Gulf ) , where crew members went ashore and saw footprints ; this was the closest that Europeans had yet come to making contact with indigenous Australians in Western Australia . Janszoon and Jacobszoon assumed that the cape was an island : the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent that it was named Cloates Island in 1720 and this misconception lingered until the 19th century . As the Willems River was also named in July it would appear that the ' ' Mauritius ' ' , which reached Bantam ( city ) The 1627 chart was based on a number of voyages , beginning with the 1616 voyage of Dirk Hartog . On that voyage Hartog named Eendrachtsland after his ship , the ' ' Eendracht ' ' meaning Unity . Eendrachtsland is one of the earliest names given to the Australian mainland . # Notes #

4 In the field of computer vision , velocity moments are weighted averages of the intensities of pixels in a sequence of images , similar to image moments but in addition to describing an object 's shape also describe its motion through the sequence of images . Velocity moments can be used to aid automated identification of a shape in an image when information about the motion is significant in its description . There are currently two established versions of velocity moments : CartesianJ . D. Shutler , M. S. Nixon , C. J. Harris , Statistical Gait Description via Temporal Moments , Proc . SSIAI 2000 - Austin , Texas , : pp. 291-295 , 2000 and Zernike.J . D. Shutler and M. S. Nixon , Zernike Velocity Moments for Description and Recognition of Moving Shapes , Proc . BMVC 2001 , Manchester , UK , 2:pp. 705-714 , 2001 # Cartesian velocity moments # # Cartesian moments for single images # A Cartesian moment of a single image is calculated by : <math> mpq = sumx=1M sumy=1N xp yq Pxy </math> where <math> M </math> and <math> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pxy </math> is the intensity of the pixel at the point <math> ( x , y ) </math> in the image , and <math> xp yq </math> is the basis function . # Cartesian velocity moments for sequences of images # Cartesian velocity moments are based on these Cartesian moments . A Cartesian velocity moment <math> vmpqmugamma </math> is defined by : <math> vmpqmugamma = sumi=2images sumx=1M sumy=1N U ( i , mu , gamma ) C ( i , p , g ) Pixy </math> where <math> M </math> and <math> N </math> are again the dimensions of the image , <math> images </math> is the number of images in the sequence , and <math> Pixy </math> is the intensity of the pixel at the point <math> ( x , y ) </math> in image <math> i </math> . <math> C ( i , p , q ) </math> is taken from Central moments , added so the equation is translation invariant , defined as : <math> C ( i , p , q ) = ( x-overlinexi ) p ( y-overlineyi ) q </math> where <math> overlinexi </math> is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for image <math> i </math> , and similarly for <math> y </math> . <math> U ( i , mu , gamma ) </math> introduces velocity into the equation as : <math> U ( i , mu , gamma ) = ( overlinexi-overlinexi-1 ) mu ( overlineyi-overlineyi-1 ) gamma </math> where <math> overlinexi-1 </math> is the <math> x </math> coordinate of the centre of mass for the previous image , <math> i-1 </math> , and again similarly for <math> y </math> . After the Cartesian velocity moment is calculated , it can be normalised by : <math> overlinevmpqmugamma = frac vmpqmugammaA * I </math> where <math> A </math> is the average area of the object , in pixels , and <math> I </math> is the number of images . Now the value is not affected by the number of images in the sequence or the size of the object . As Cartesian moments are non-orthogonal , so are Cartesian velocity moments , so different moments can be closely correlated . These velocity moments do however provide translation and scale invariance ( unless the scale changes within the sequence of images ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images # A Zernike moment of a single image is calculated by : <math> Amn = frac m + 1pi sumx sumy Vmn ( r , theta ) * Pxy </math> where <math> * </math> denotes the complex conjugate , <math> m </math> is an integer between <math> 0 </math> and <math> infty </math> , and <math> n </math> is an integer such that <math> m - n </math> is even and <math> n **10;257747; . For calculating Zernike moments , the image , or section of the image which is of interest is mapped to the unit disc , then <math> Pxy </math> is the intensity of the pixel at the point <math> ( x , y ) </math> on the disc and <math> x2 + y2 le 1 </math> is a restriction on values of <math> x </math> and <math> y </math> . The coordinates are then mapped to polar coordinates , and <math> r </math> and <math> theta </math> are the polar coordinates of the point <math> ( x , y ) </math> on the unit disc map . <math> Vmn ( r , theta ) </math> is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vmn ( r , theta ) = Rmn(r)ejntheta </math> : <math> Rmn(r) = sums=0frac m-n2 ( -1 ) s F ( m , n , s , r ) </math> : <math> F ( m , n , s , r ) = frac ( m-s ) ! s ! ( frac m+n2-s ) ! ( frac m-n2-s ) ! rm-2s </math> # Zernike velocity moments for sequences of images # Zernike velocity moments are based on these Zernike moments . A Zernike velocity moment <math> Amnmugamma </math> is defined by : <math> Amnmugamma = frac m + 1pi sumi=2images sumx=1 sumy=1 U ( i , mu , gamma ) Vmn ( r , theta ) * Pixy </math> where <math> images </math> is again the number of images in the sequence , and <math> Pixy </math> is the intensity of the pixel at the point <math> ( x , y ) </math> on the unit disc mapped from image <math> i </math> . <math> U ( i , mu , gamma ) </math> introduces velocity into the equation in the same way as in the Cartesian velocity moments and <math> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Zernike moments equation above . Like the Cartesian velocity moments , Zernike velocity moments can be normalised by : <math> overlineAmnmugamma = frac AmnmugammaA * I </math> where <math> A </math> is the average area of the object , in pixels , and <math> I </math> is the number of images . As Zernike velocity moments are based on the orthogonal Zernike moments , they produce less correlated and more compact descriptions than Cartesian velocity moments . Zernike velocity moments also provide translation and scale invariance ( even when the scale changes within the sequence ) . # Comparison of methods # # References # <references/>

4 Glencairn 's rising was a Royalist uprising in 1653 in Scotland against the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell . It was led by William Cunningham , 9th Earl of Glencairn ( 16101664 ) , who was given command of the Royalist forces in Scotland by Charles II . He convened a meeting of Scottish notables , such as Blackadder of Tullyallan , who then mustered their vassals and supporters to form a small army . The governor of Stirling Castle , Colonel Kidd , sallied out to suppress this force but was defeated by them at Aberfoyle . Glencairn 's forces also fought against Cromwell at the Battle of Tullich in 1652 . The Royalist army continued to grow but dissension developed when command was reassigned from Glencairn to John Middleton , 1st Earl of Middleton . This was largely due to petty disputes between Glencairn 's and Middleton 's respective forces . The former being mainly Scottish Lowlanders and the latter being mainly Scottish Highlanders . This eventually led to a duel between one of Middleton 's officers , Sir George Munro and Glencairn himself . They duelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was placed under arrest by the orders of Middleton and his sword was taken from him . The following day two junior officers from the two camps had a duel of their own in which one was killed and the other was later arrested and hanged .

4 NACA Report No. 964 - The effects of variations in Reynolds number between 3.0 x 10 <sup> 6 </sup> and 25.0 x 10 <sup> 6 </sup> upon the aerodynamic characteristics of a number of NACA 6-series airfoil sections was published by the United States National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1950 . It contained a series of graphs showing the resulting lift and drag of several NACA 6-series airfoil sections from tests performed in a variable-density wind tunnel , in which the Reynolds number ( RN ) was set at three different values . # Summary # Results are presented of an investigation made to determine the two-dimensional lift and drag characteristics of nine NACA 6-series airfoil sections at RN of 15.0 , 20.0 , and 25.0 million . Also presented are data from NACA Rep. 824 for the same airfoils at RN of 3.0 , 6.0 , and 9.0 million . The airfoils selected represent sections having variations in the airfoil thickness , thickness form , and camber . The characteristics of an airfoil with a split flap were determined in one instance , as was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow behavior are advanced for the observed types of scale effect . # Introduction # Two-dimensional aerodynamic data obtained at RN of 3.0 , 6.0 and 9.0 million are now generally available for a large number of systematically derived NACA airfoil sections . This range of RN is sufficient to satisfy engineering needs for many practical applications , but the recent trends toward both very large and very high-speed aircraft have emphasized the necessity for aerodynamic data at higher values . An investigation has accordingly been made of the aerodynamic characteristics of a number of systematically varied NACA 6-series airfoils at RN of 15.0 , 20.0 and 25.0 million . The results of this investigation at high RN together with those for the same airfoils at lower RN are presented in Report No. 964 . The NACA 63 series was chosen as the basic group for investigation because these airfoils appear to offer good low-speed characteristics with a minimum of compromise from consideration of the high-speed characteristics . In all cases , only lift and drag were measured . # Apparatus # All the tests were made in the Langley two-dimensional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures 3 x 7.5 feet , and the model completely spanned the 3-foot dimension . Seals were installed between the ends of the model and the tunnel walls to prevent air leakage . # Test results # # Drag # The reaction of the minimum drag coefficient of smooth airfoils to increasing RN is attributed to the relative strengths of two interacting boundary-layer changes . A thinning of the boundary layer with increasing RN gives a gradual decrease of minimum drag . As the RN is increased beyond a certain value , however , the transition point begins to move forward and the drag increases . The flow conditions of the thicker airfoils are more favorable for delaying the forward movement of transition . The addition of standard roughness to the NACA 63-009 section causes a large increase in the minimum drag at all RN , but increasing the RN has a favorable effect in reducing the drag . Increasing the RN from 9.0 to 15.0 million resulted in the almost complete disappearance of the low-drag range of all the airfoils except that of 18% thickness . # Lift # The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no variation with RN . Throughout the range of RN of this investigation , the values of the lift-curve slope for the smooth sections are very close to that predicted by thin-airfoil theory ( 2 per radian , or 0.110 per degree ) . The effects of increasing RN on the maximum lift showed two general trends : for airfoils of 12% thickness or less , the maximum lift remains relatively constant over the lower range of RN . Increasing the RN , however , causes a rapid increase in maximum lift ; the 18% thick airfoils demonstrated a steady increase of maximum lift as RN is increased . # Concluding remarks # The 18% thick section had a type of maximum-lift variation with the RN that was entirely different from the thinner sections . Any comparison of airfoil maximum-lift characteristics can be made only if the data for the group of airfoils under consideration are available at the same RN . The choice of an optimum airfoil for maximum lift for a given applcation must be determined from data corresponding to the operating RN of the application .

4 Melvin Lawrence Ember ( January 13 , 1933 September 27 , 2009 ) was an American cultural anthropologist and cross-cultural researcher with wide-ranging interests who combined an active research career with writing for nonprofessionals. # Biography # Drawn to anthropology after reading the works of Margaret Mead , he attended Columbia University at the young age of 16 where he was further inspired by Elman Service and Morton Fried in the anthropology department ( B.A. 1953 ) . He then went on to Yale University to study for his Ph.D . in anthropology ( received 1958 ) , primarily under the mentorship of George Peter Murdock . After a years postdoctoral work at Yale , Ember spent four years at the Laboratory of Socio-Environmental Studies at the National Institute of Health ( 19591962 ) . He was professor at Antioch College ( 19631967 ) and Hunter College ( 19671987 ) . He also chaired the department of anthropology at Hunter College of the City University of New York ( 19671973 ) . Here he succeeded in expanding the department significantly , attracting young scholars from major institutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York graduate program in anthropology from 1973 to 1975 . He was president of the Society for Cross-Cultural Research in 1981-1982 and in 1982 took over the editorship of Cross-Cultural Research , a position he held until the time of his death . He moved to the New Haven area in 1987 to become president of the Human Relations Area Files ( HRAF ) , an institution at Yale whose mission is to foster the comparative study of culture . Under his leadership , he helped revitalize the institution , moving its databases into the digital age . # Work # # Fieldwork # In contrast to most cultural anthropologists at the time , who conducted their fieldwork in a single community , Ember 's fieldwork in American Samoa was explicitly comparative , using community variation to test theories about culture change . He chose three communities differing in distance from the commercial center to evaluate how commercial involvement affected political change . His assessment of Samoan kinship was subsequently challenged by Derek Freeman , long before the now-famous MeadFreeman controversy about Samoa . Because Ember knew , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Samoa , he questioned how Freeman , working in a very different time and in Western Samoa , could doubt Meads veracity . # National Institute of Mental Health # At the National Institute of Mental Health Embler worked on the universality of the familial incest taboo . Since all societies prohibit familial incest , he decided to focus on cross-cultural variation in cousin marriage to try to understand why some societies allowed close cousin marriages while others forbade it . After evaluating the various explanatory hypotheses of the time , his own empirical research confirmed that much of the variation in cousin marriage could best be explained as an adaptation to the harmful effects of inbreeding . # Cross-cultural work # As a professor at Antioch College and Hunter College Ember continued his cross-cultural work on aspects of kinship and social organization , picking up first on topics that Murdock was unable to explain , such as variation in post-marital residence and unilineal descent . Traditional theories had focused on economic factors , such as which gender contributed most to the economy , but finding these explanations lacking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly the effects of warfare in the social environment . Because warfare seemed so central in explaining various aspects of social organization , he then turned to research that tested ideas about why societies varied in type and frequency of violence , looking at variation in warfare frequency , homicide , and corporal punishment of children in the anthropological record . Believing that laws about human nature should hold true among technological complex as well as simpler societies , he persuaded political scientist Bruce Russett to join him and his wife Carol R. Ember in a project to test the theory that democracies do not fight each other . Although the concepts of democracy and international war had to be transformed to fit the anthropological record , the results of their collaborative research were consistent with many studies conducted by political scientists . Ember later worked with cross-cultural psychologists to explore the relationships between aggression and war . # Interdisciplinary research # Branching out into diverse and interdisciplinary research areas was not unusual for Ember . Indeed , he published scholarly articles in archaeology , linguistics , biological anthropology , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different anthropologists in far-flung places and across time could be used to test theories about why cultures varied or were similar and he devoted most of his research career to systematically testing explanations , rather than just expounding them . His passion for systematic comparative research on challenging questions in all areas of anthropology influenced a generation of younger scholars through his direction of the first Summer Institute for Cross-Cultural Research in 1964 , his active participation in NSF-funded Summer Institutes in Comparative Research between 1991 and 1999 , and through the series of publications in comparative methods that resulted from these Institutes . # Publications # Ember is widely known as the co-author of two major textbooks , ' ' Anthropology ' ' ( with Carol R. Ember and Peter N. Peregrine , Prentice-Hall ) , and ' ' Cultural Anthropology ' ' ( with Carol R. Ember , Prentice-Hall ) , first published in 1973 and now in their 13th edition ( 2011 ) . He was also editor or co-editor of eight encyclopedias.

4 ' ' The Riots ' ' is a play created by Gillian Slovo from spoken evidence , which explains and evaluates the events that took place during the 2011 England riots . The play is written in the style of verbatim theatre using interviews from politicians , police , rioters and victims involved in the riots . ' ' The Riots ' ' first opened at the Tricycle Theatre in Kilburn on 22 November 2011 , after previewing from 17 November 2011. # Context # On 6 August 2011 rioting broke out in Tottenham , London in reaction to the death of Mark Duggan , who was shot dead by a police officer on 4 August . Over the next four nights the rioting spread , affecting other areas of London and the rest of England . Serious rioting , looting , assault , and damage to property and businesses took place in cites all over England . Less than two weeks after the initial rioting on 6 August , police forces throughout England had made nearly 3,000 arrests . The government refused to hold a full public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , artistic director of ' ' The Riots ' ' , contacted Gillian Slovo only days after the rioting began and together they created a dramatic response to these terrible events , which they claimed would answer some questions . # Overview # ' ' The Riots ' ' is staged in two-halves . The first half gives a thorough and vivid image of how the riots unfolded and spread from city to city . This is told through witness accounts from rioters , police officers , onlookers and local residents , in particular Mohamed Hammoudan , whose house was burnt down . The second half reflects on the riots , using interviews from politicians , rioters , police , teachers , community leaders , lawyers and social workers , analysing why the riots occurred , for what reasons and how society and the government can learn from them .

4 Knowledge Based Community Sharing System(KBCSS) is one of the standard project scenarios of IBM 's THE GREAT MIND CHALLENGE 2011 . Conceptualized by Mr.Karthick Lokala and Mr.P.D.K Pavan kumar under the team name KP 's eagle software solutions during their graduation in 2010 at KL University , Guntur , AP , India . # Concept # Today most of the educational institutions in India are understaffed and does not have a basic interaction with industry . It now exists in such a way that Industries are now not part of the education system . Providing an environment for **36;13114;TOOLONG experts will drive us to make up an online knowledge centre for education and research . The basic idea of KBCSS is to provide an environment for the students and faculty of a university to enhance their technical skills and to share their knowledge with their fellow students or **30;13152;TOOLONG experts . It also aims to provide a platform for mutual cooperation between different kinds of users , learning by mining ( i.e. , previous discussions are a source which is studied ) . The system was proposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are unidirectional i.e. , from faculty to students to a bidirectional way i.e. , also from student to faculty . # Traditional e-learning features # The system offers all the traditional e-learning features like file uploads/downloads , videos on subjects and experiments , discussion manager and search facilities . The base of these traditional e-learning system is from Learning Management System(LMS). # Learning by mining # The source of knowledge in the system is by using the DISCUSSION MANAGER component . The discussion manager acts as a source of knowledge . The knowledge can be mined and can be processed to create notes for a particular topic in a subject . An efficient data mining algorithm is formulated to create the concept of Learning by mining . A lot of extensive research work is being carried out in this part of Knowledge Based Community Sharing System . # Groups # The GROUPS are the backbone to the Knowledge Based Community Sharing System .

4 Kansai Music Conference ( KMC ) ( ' ' Kansai Myuujikku Kanfarensu ' ' ) , is an international music industry conference based in the city of Osaka , located next to Kobe and Kyoto in the Kansai region of Japan , approx. 600 km west of Tokyo . Established in 2009 , the conference focuses on the music scene in Japan , specifically the Kansai area . # Further activities # * Promoting tourism and cultural awareness of the Kansai area to non-Japanese * Organizing and sponsoring benefits and charity events for causes both in Japan and overseas * Organizing , co-sponsoring , and facilitating networking events and showcases for musicians and music industry professionals in Japan year-round , with a focus on the Kansai region # History # # 2009 # The first Kansai Music Conference was held on September 19 and 20 , 2009 at Convention Room AP Osaka .

The Opening Party was held on the 17th , showcases on the 18th , and the main conference on the 19th and 20th . The main conference venue was changed to the Osaka Museum of History which also served as co-sponsor . In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake , participating musicians did a tribute performance and benefit drive for Haiti refugees . # 2011 # KMC 2011 was held September 1619 , continuing the same basic schedule as the previous year . Notable performers and attendees included Katie Rox from Canada and Adam Tyler from the US . This year saw the addition of an English rakugo ( traditional Japanese comedy in English ) show and a grand finale on the 19th that featured several performers doing a tribute to the victims of the 2011 Thoku earthquake and tsunami. # 2012 # KMC 2012 ( program ) was held from September 14 17 .

Osaka band Riot Dance Party was able to make their first tour overseas in Australia through connections made with an Aussie band at a KMC show . Another connection was made when American hip hop artist , Legrande , met with a professor at Temple University Japan Campus in Tokyo to collaborate on a project with college students to create a character in Second Life . Canadian singer-songwriter Katie Rox has commented on her success at KMC in an interview with Canadian music news site North By East West , saying , I have noticed CD sales , twitter and Facebook followers have increased since the trip , so I would say it was a success ! Rox explained the value of the conference in her view , saying further that the conference is especially valuable to independent musicians that lack the support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who you are . That can be hard without label support . KMC has built up a team of sponsors , partners , and supporters , both in Japan and internationally . Also , several charity drives for earthquake victims have been organized by the KMC Executive Board . # Challenges # KMC provides a forum for independent musicians around the world to network with other musicians , music related companies and organizations , experience the live music scene in Japan , as well as participate in seminars , presentations and workshops about music and the music industry . There is little precedent for such an event in Japan . As an independently organized event , KMC currently does not attract big companies , major label reps , and music industry executives like similar events in other countries , due to the general unfamiliarity of the concept and closed nature of the Japanese music industry . According to Levi , Its amazing how artists with such talent are practicing and performing with almost no attention from the music industry Its almost impossible for independent musicians in Japan to move up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KMC is my way of affecting changea change to a better and more rewarding music scene in Japan. 
4 The terms macrophage and microphage are used in ecology to describe heterotrophs that consume food in two different ways . Both macrophages and microphages ingest solid food and may process it through some sort of alimentary canal . However , a macrophage handles food items singly , while a microphage handles food items in bulk without manipulating them individually . Microphages include suspension feeders , and often incidentally digest low-quality food items . Another category of heterotrophs based on feeding mechanism , known as osmotrophs , is made up of organisms ( primarily fungi and bacteria ) that absorb organism matter directly across their cell membranes . The terms macrophage and microphage were originally used in this sense by Jordan and Hirsch ( 1927 ; cited in Yonge 1928 ) . Although they have been used in ecology texts as recently as 2002 , the terms macrophage and microphage today are primarily used to describe two different types of white blood cells in the vertebrate immune system . 
4 After World War II and the collapse of the country 's monarchy , the French attempted to re-establish its colonial rule but ultimately failed in the First Indochina War . The Geneva Accords in 1954 partitioned the country temporarily in two with a promise of democratic election in 1956 to reunite the country . However , the United States and South Vietnam insisted on United Nations supervision of any election to prevent fraud , which the Soviet Union and North Vietnam refused . The Vietnam War ended with the Fall of Saigon in 1975 . After the reunification in 1975 , Vietnam suffered further internal repression and isolation from the international community due to the Cold War , Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and an American economic embargo . In 1986 , the Communist Party of Vietnam changed its economic policy and began reforms of the private sector similar to those in the China . Since the mid-1980s , Vietnam has enjoyed substantial economic growth . # The Birth of the Republic ( 1945 ) # The Japanese occupied Vietnam during World War II but allowed the French to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end in August 1945 , a power vacuum was created in Vietnam . Capitalizing on this , the Vit Minh launched the August Revolution across the country to seize government offices . Emperor Bo i abdicated on August 25 , 1945 , ending the Nguyn Dynasty . On September 2 , 1945 , at Ba nh Square , Ho Chi Minh , leader of the Viet Minh organization , declared Vietnam 's independence under the new name of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( DRVN ) in a speech that invoked the United States Declaration of Independence and the French Revolution 's Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen . Ho sent several letters to the US government asking to be recognised as the government of Vietnam and offering friendship to America , but none were ever answered . # Communist North &amp; capitalist South ( 1945&amp;ndash ; 75 ) # # Indochina War ( 1945&amp;ndash ; 54 ) # The British commander in Southeast Asia , Lord Louis Mountbatten , sent 20,000 troops of the 20th Indian division to occupy Saigon under General Douglas Gracey who landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese and restoring order . They had to re-arm Japanese prisoners of war known as Gremlin force to keep order until more troops arrived . The British began to withdraw in December 1945 , but this was not completed until June of the following year . The last British soldiers were killed in Vietnam in June 1946 . Altogether 40 British and Indian troops were killed and over a hundred were wounded . Vietnamese casualties were 600 . They were followed by French troops trying to re-establish their rule . In the north , Chiang Kai-shek 's Kuomintang army entered Vietnam from China , also to disarm the Japanese , followed by the forces of the non-Communist Vietnamese parties , such as Vit Nam Quc Dn ng and Vit Nam Cch Mng ng Minh Hi .

These negotiations will deal particularly with : : : a. diplomatic relations of Viet Nam with Foreign States : : b. the future law of Indochina : : c . French interests , economic and cultural , in Viet Nam . The seat of the conference was held at either Hanoi , Saigon or Paris . In 1947 full scale war broke out between the Viet Minh and France . Realizing that colonialism was coming to an end worldwide , France fashioned a semi-independent State of Vietnam , within the French Union , with Bo i as Head of State . Meanwhile , as the Communists under Mao Zedong took over China , the Viet Minh began to receive military aid from China . Beside supplying materials , Chinese cadres also pressured the Vietnamese Communist Party , then under First Secretary Trng Chinh , to emulate their brand of revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Viet Minh ranks , carrying out a ruthless and bloody land reform campaign ( Ci Cch Rung t ) , and denouncing bourgeois and feudal tendencies in arts and literature . Many true patriots and devoted Communist revolutionaries in the Viet Minh suffered mistreatment or were even executed during these movements . Many others became disenchanted and left the Viet Minh . The United States became strongly opposed to H Ch Minh . In the 1950s the government of Bo i gained recognition by the United States and the United Kingdom . The Vit Minh force grew significantly with China 's assistance and in 1954 , under the command of General V Nguyn Gip , launched a major siege against French bases in in Bin Ph . The Vit Minh force surprised Western military experts with their use of primitive means to move artillery pieces and supplies up the mountains surrounding in Bin Ph , giving them a decisive advantage . On May 7 , 1954 , French troops at in Bin Ph , under Christian de Castries , surrendered to the Viet Minh and in July 1954 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paving the way for the French to leave Vietnam . # Vietnam War ( 1954&amp;ndash ; 75 ) # The Geneva Conference of 1954 ended France 's colonial presence in Vietnam and partitioned the country into two states at the 17th parallel pending unification on the basis of internationally supervised free elections . Ng nh Dim , a former mandarin with a strong Catholic and Confucian background , was selected as Premier of the State of Vietnam by Bo i . While Dim was trying to settle the differences between the various armed militias in the South , Bo i was persuaded to reduce his power . Dim created a referendum in 1955 to depose Bo i and declared himself President of the Republic of Vietnam ( South Vietnam ) . The Republic of Vietnam ( RVN ) was proclaimed in Saigon on October 26 , 1955 . The United States began to provide military and economic aid to the RVN , training RVN personnel , and sending U.S. advisors to assist in building the infrastructure for the new government . Also in 1954 , Viet Minh forces took over North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnamese civilians emigrated to South Vietnam to avoid persecution from the imminent Communist regime . At the same time , Viet Minh armed forces from South Vietnam were also moving to North Vietnam , as dictated by the Geneva Accord . However , some high-ranking Viet Minh cadres secretly remained in the South to follow the local situation closely , and created a communist insurgency against the Southern government if necessary . The most important figure among those was L Dun . The Geneva Accord had promised elections to determine the government for a unified Vietnam . Neither the United States government nor Ng nh Dim 's State of Vietnam signed anything at the 1954 Geneva Conference . With respect to the question of reunification , the non-communist Vietnamese delegation objected strenuously to any division of Vietnam , but lost out when the French accepted the proposal of Viet Minh delegate Phm Vn ng , who proposed that Vietnam eventually be united by elections under the supervision of local commissions . The United States countered with what became known as the American Plan , with the support of South Vietnam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supervision of the United Nations , but was rejected by the Soviet delegation . Dim took strong measures to secure South Vietnam from perceived internal threats , especially from the Viet Cong . He eliminated all private militias from the Bnh Xuyn Party and the Cao i and Ha Ho religious sects . In October 1955 , he deposed Bo i and proclaimed himself President of the newly established the Republic of Vietnam , after rigging a referendum . He repressed political opposition , arresting the famous writer Nguyn Tng Tam , who committed suicide while awaiting trial in jail . Dim also acted aggressively to remove Communist agents still remaining in the South . He formed the Cn Lao Nhn V Party , mixing Individualist philosophy with republican and capitalist elements , as well as being anti-Communist and pro-Catholic . Another controversial policy was the Strategic Hamlet Program , which aimed to build fortified villages to remove and lock out Communists . However , it was in some ways ineffective as many covert communists were already part of the population and visually indistinguishable . It became unpopular as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . In North Vietnam during the 1950s , political opposition groups were suppressed ; those publicly opposing the government were imprisoned in hard labor camps . Prisoners were abused and beaten atop of labor-intensive work forced upon them . Many died of exhaustion , starvation , illness ( who often died without any medical attention ) , or assault by prison guards . Many middle-class , intellectual Northerners had been lured into speaking out against Ho 's communist regime , and most of them were later imprisoned in gulags , or executed , known as the Nhn VnGiai Phm affair . The government launched a land reform program , which , according to Steven Rosefielde , was aimed at exterminating class enemies . Victims were chosen in an arbitrary manner , following a quota of four to five percent . Torture was used on a wide scale , so much so that by 1956 Ho Chi Minh became concerned , and had it banned . to 172,000 people perished in the campaigns against wealthy farmers and landowners . Rosefielde discusses much higher estimates that range from 200,000 to 900,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . A Northern democratic literary movement called Nhn vn-Giai phm ( from the names of the two magazines which started the movement , based in Hanoi ) occurred , in which it attempted to encourage the democratization of the North and the free expression of thought . Intellectuals were thus lured into criticizing the leadership so they could be arrested later , many of whom were sent to hard labor camps ( Gulags ) , following the model of Mao Tse-tung 's Hundred Flowers campaign in China . Freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and other basic civilian freedoms were soon revoked after the government 's attempt of destroying the literary movement . A puritan personality cult was also established around Ho Chi Minh , later extended nationwide after the Communist reunification of the Vietnam , and is reminiscent to other Communist nations like North Korea , and the Soviet Union . In 1960 , at the Third Party Congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party , ostensibly renamed the Labor Party since 1951 , L Dun arrived from the South and strongly advocated the use of revolutionary warfare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish communism nationwide . Despite some elements in the Party opposing the use of force , L Dun won the seat of First Secretary of the Party . As H Ch Minh was aging , L Dun virtually took the helm of war from him . The first step of his war plan was coordinating a rural uprising in the South ( ng Khi ) and forming the Viet Cong or National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam ( NLF ) toward the end of 1960 . The figurehead leader of the Viet Cong was Nguyn Hu Th , a South Vietnamese lawyer , but the true leadership was the Communist Party hierarchy in South Vietnam . Arms , supplies , and troops came from North Vietnam into South Vietnam via a system of trails , named the Ho Chi Minh trail , that branched into Laos and Cambodia before entering South Vietnam . At first , most foreign aid for North Vietnam came from China , as L Dun distanced Vietnam from the revisionist policy of the Soviet Union under Nikita Khrushchev . However , under Leonid Brezhnev , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided North Vietnam with heavy weapons , such as T-54 tanks , artillery , MIG fighter planes , surface-to-air missiles etc . Meanwhile , in South Vietnam , although Ng nh Dim personally was respected for his nationalism , political stability and policies triggering rapid economic growth , he ran a nepotistic and authoritarian government . Elections were routinely rigged and Dim favored of minority Roman Catholics on many issues , believing that Catholics were more trustworthy , more anti-communist and more impermeable to Viet Cong infiltration . His religious policies sparked protests from the Buddhist community after demonstrators were killed on Vesak , Buddha 's birthday , in 1963 when they were protesting a ban on the Buddhist flag . This incident sparked mass protests calling for religious equality . The most famous case was of Venerable Thch Qung c , who burned himself to death to protest . The images of this event made worldwide headlines and brought extreme embarrassment for Dim . The tension was not resolved , and on August 21 , the ARVN Special Forces loyal to his brother and chief adviser Ng nh Nhu and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , leaving a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds . In the United States , the Kennedy administration became worried that the problems of Dim 's government were undermining the US 's anti-Communist effort in Southeast Asia , and of Dim 's increasing resistance and non-cooperation with the American government . On November 1 , 1963 , with the planning and backing of the CIA and the Kennedy administration , South Vietnamese generals led by Dng Vn Minh engineered a coup d ' tat and overthrew Ng nh Dim , killing both him and his brother Nhu. ( ' ' see also Ng nh Cn ' ' ) Between 1963 and 1965 , South Vietnam was extremely unstable as no government could keep power for long . There were more coups , often more than one every year . The Communist-run Viet Cong expanded their operation and scored some significant military victories during this period . In 1965 , US President Lyndon Johnson sent troops to South Vietnam to secure the country and started to bomb North Vietnam , assuming that if South Vietnam fell to the Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with the domino theory . Other US allies , such as Australia , New Zealand , South Korea , Thailand , the Philippines , and Taiwan also sent troops to South Vietnam . Although the American-led troops succeeded in containing the advance of Communist forces , the presence of foreign troops , the widespread bombing over all of Vietnam , and the social vices that mushroomed around US bases upset the sense of national pride among many Vietnamese , North and South , causing some to become sympathetic to North Vietnam and the Viet Cong . In 1965 , Air Marshal Nguyn Cao K and General Nguyn Vn Thiu took power in a coup , and presided over a stable junta , and promised to hold elections under US pressure . In 1967 , South Vietnam managed to conduct a National Assembly and Presidential election with Lt. General Nguyn Vn Thiu being elected to the Presidency , bringing the government to some level of stability . However , in 1968 , the Viet Cong launched a massive and surprise Tt Offensive ( known in South Vietnam as Bin C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tn Cng v Ni Dy Tt Mu Thn ) , attacking almost all major cities in South Vietnam over the Vietnamese New Year ( Tt ) . The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese captured the city of Hu , after which many mass graves were found . Many of the executed victims had relations with the South Vietnamese government or the US , or part of social groups that were considered enemies to the Viet Cong , like Catholics , business owners and intellectuals ( Thm St Tt Mu Thn ) . Over the course of the year the Viet Cong forces were pushed out of all cities in South Vietnam and nearly decimated . In subsequent major offensives in later years , North Vietnamese regulars with artillery and tanks took over the fighting . In the months following the Tet Offensive , an American unit massacred civilian villagers , suspected to be sheltering Viet Cong guerillas , in the hamlet of My Lai in Central Vietnam , causing an uproar in protest around the world . In 1969 , H Ch Minh died , leaving wishes that his body be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for public display and built the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum on Ba nh Square in H Ni , in the style of Lenin 's Mausoleum in Moscow . Although the Tt Offensive was a catastrophic military defeat for the Vit Cng , it was a stunning political victory as it led many Americans to view the war as unwinnable . U.S. President Richard Nixon entered office with a pledge to end the war with honor . He normalized US relations with China in 1972 and entered into dtente with the USSR . Nixon thus forged a new strategy to deal with the Communist Bloc , taking advantage of the rift between China and the Soviet Union . A costly war in Vietnam begun to appear less effective for the cause of Communist containment . Nixon proposed Vietnamization of the war , with South Vietnamese troops taking charge of the fighting , yet still receiving American aid and , if necessary , air and naval support . The new strategy started to show some effects : in 1970 , troops from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campaign ) ; in 1971 , the ARVN made an incursion into Southern Laos to cut off the Ho Chi Minh trail in Operation Lam Son 719 , but the operation failed as most high positions captured by ARVN forces were recaptured by North Vietnamese artillery ; in 1972 , the ARVN successfully held the town of An Lc against massive attacks from North Vietnamese regulars and recaptured the town of Qung Tr near the demilitarised zone ( DMZ ) in the center of the country during the Easter Offensive . At the same time , Nixon was pressing both Hanoi and Saigon to sign the Paris Peace Agreement of 1973 , for American military forces to withdraw from Vietnam . The pressure on Hanoi materialized with the Christmas Bombings in 1972 . In South Vietnam , Nguyn Vn Thiu vocally opposed any accord with the Communists , but was threatened with withdrawal of American aid . Despite the peace treaty , the North violated the treaty and continued the war as had been envisioned by L Dun and the South still tried to recapture lost territories . In the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seen as losing a strong backer . Under U.S. President Gerald Ford , the Democratic-controlled Congress became less willing to provide military support to South Vietnam . In 1974 , South Vietnam also fought and lost the Battle of Hong Sa , in defending the islands against the invading Chinese over the control of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea . Neither North Vietnam nor the U.S. were involved . In early 1975 , North Vietnamese military led by General Vn Tin Dng launched a massive attack against the Central Highland province of Bun M Thut . South Vietnamese troops had anticipated attack against the neighboring province of Pleiku , and were caught off guard . President Nguyn Vn Thiu ordered the moving of all troops from the Central Highland to the coastal areas , as with shrinking American aid , South Vietnamese forces could not afford to spread too thin . However , due to lack of experience and logistics for such a large troop movement in such a short time , the whole South Vietnamese 2nd Corps got bogged down on narrow mountain roads , flooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambushes along the way . The South Vietnamese First Corps near the DMZ was cut off , received conflicting orders from Saigon on whether to fight or to retreat , and eventually collapsed . Many civilians tried to flee to Saigon via land , air , and sea routes , suffering massive casualties along the way . In early April 1975 , South Vietnam set up a last-ditch defense line at Xun Lc , under commander L Minh o . North Vietnamese troops failed to penetrate the line and had to make a detour , which the South Vietnamese failed to stop due to lack of troops . President Nguyn vn Thiu resigned . Power fell to Dng Vn Minh . Dng Vn Minh had led the coup against Dim in 1963 . By the mid-1970s , he had leaned toward the Third Party ( Thnh Phn Th Ba ) , South Vietnamese elites who favored dialogues and cooperation with the North . Communist infiltrators in the South tried to work out political deals to let Dng Vn Minh ascend to the Presidency , with the hope that he would prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although many South Vietnamese units were ready to defend Saigon , and the ARVN 4th Corps was still intact in the Mekong Delta , Dng Vn Minh ordered a surrender on April 30 , 1975 , sparing Saigon from destruction . Nevertheless , the reputation of the North Vietnamese army towards perceived traitors preceded them , and hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese fled the country by all means : airplanes , helicopters , ships , fishing boats , and barges . Most were picked up by the U.S. Seventh Fleet in the South China Sea or landed in Thailand . The seaborne refugees came to be known as boat people . In a famous case , a South Vietnamese pilot , with his wife and children aboard a small Cessna plane , landed safely without a tailhook on the aircraft carrier . This mass exodus of ( mostly South ) Vietnamese political refugees continued into the 1980s as refugees fled from persecution , political oppression and economic collapse caused by the new Communist regime . During this period , North Vietnam was a Communist state with a centralized command economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proletariat , a powerful propaganda machine that effectively rallied the people for the Party 's causes , a superb intelligence system that infiltrated South Vietnam ( spies such as Phm Ngc Tho climbed to high military government positions ) , and a severe suppression of political opposition . Even some decorated veterans and famed Communist cadres , such as Trn c Tho , Nguyn Hu ang , Trn Dn , Hong Minh Chnh , were persecuted during the late 1950s Nhn Vn Giai Phm events and the 1960s Trial Against the Anti-Party Revisionists ( V n Xt Li Chng ng ) for speaking their opinions . Nevertheless , this iron grip , together with consistent support from the Soviet Union and China , gave North Vietnam a militaristic advantage over South Vietnam . North Vietnamese leadership also had a steely determination to fight , even when facing massive casualties and destruction at their end . The young North Vietnamese were idealistically and innocently patriotic , ready to give the ultimate sacrifice for the liberation of the South and the unification of the motherland . # Socialist Republic ( from 1976 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring Offensive were killed or abducted on the road to Tuy Ha in 1975 . Sources have estimated that 165,000 South Vietnamese died in the re-education camps out of 1-2.5 million sent , while somewhere between 50,000 and 250,000 were executed . ) . Rummel estimates that slave labor in the New Economic Zones caused 50,000 deaths ( out of a total 1 million deported ) . The number of Vietnamese boat people who died is estimated between 200,000 and 400,000 , out of the 2.5 million that fled . There were also tens of thousands of suicides after the North Vietnamese take-over . In 1988 , Vietnam suffered a famine that afflicted millions . Many North Vietnamese soldiers and cadres began to realize that they had been indoctrinated into thinking that the South Vietnamese people were utterly poor and exploited by the imperialists and foreign capitalists who treated them like slaves , shackling , whipping and terrorizing them with dogs . Contradictory to what they were taught , they saw an abundance of food and consumer goods , fashionable clothes , plenty of books and music ; things that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed by Dng Thu Hng , a former northern Viet Cong fighter turned democracy activist and book author , who wrote of this in her book Paradise of the Blind . In 1976 , Vietnam was officially unified and renamed Socialist Republic of Vietnam ( SRVN ) , with its capital in H Ni . The Vietnamese Communist Party dropped its front name Labor Party and changed the title of First Secretary , a term used by China , to General Secretary , used by the Soviet Union , with L Dun as General Secretary . The Viet Cong was dissolved . The Party emphasized development of heavy industry and collectivization of agriculture . Over the next few years , private enterprises were seized by the government and their owners were often sent to the New Economic Zones -- a communist euphemism for a thick jungle -- to clear land . The farmers were coerced into state-controlled cooperatives . Transportation of food and goods between provinces was deemed illegal except by the government . Within a short period of time , Vietnam was hit with severe shortage of food and basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , was threatened with famine . During the mid-1980s , inflation reached triple figures . In foreign relations , the SRVN became increasingly aligned with the Soviet Union by joining the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance ( Comecon ) , and signing a Friendship Pact , which was in fact a military alliance , with the Soviet Union . Tension between Vietnam and China mounted along with China 's rivalry with the Soviet Union and conflict erupted with Cambodia , China 's ally . Vietnam was also subject to trade embargoes by the U.S. and its allies . The SRVN government implemented a Stalinist dictatorship of the proletariat in the South as they did in the North . The network of security apparatus ( Cng An : literally Public Security , a communist term for the security apparatus ) controlled every aspect of people 's life . Censorship was strict and ultra-conservative , with most pre-1975 works in the fields of music , art , and literature being banned . All religions had to be re-organized into state-controlled churches . Any negative comments toward the Party , the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person the tag of Phn ng ( Reactionary ) , with consequences ranging from being harassed by police , expelled from school or workplace , to being sent to prison . Nevertheless , the Communist authority failed to suppress the black market , where food , consumer goods , and banned literature could be bought at high prices . The security apparatus also failed to stop a nationwide clandestine network of people trying to escape the country . In many cases , the security officers of some whole districts were bribed and even got involved in organizing the escape schemes . These living conditions resulted in an exodus of over a million Vietnamese secretly escaping the country either by sea or overland through Cambodia . For the people fleeing by sea , their wooden boats were often not seaworthy , were packed with people like sardines , and lacked sufficient food and water . Many were caught or shot at by the Vietnamese coast guards , many perished at sea due to boats sinking , capsizing in storms , starvation and thirst . Another major threat were the pirates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and murdered the boat people . In many cases , they massacred the whole boat . Sometimes the women were raped for days before being sold into prostitution . The people who crossed Cambodia faced equal dangers with mine fields , and the Khmer Rouge and Khmer Serei guerillas , who also robbed , raped , and killed the refugees . Some were successful in fleeing the region and landed in numbers in Malaysia , Indonesia , the Philippines , and Hong Kong , only to wind up in United Nations refugee camps . Some famous camps were Bidong in Malaysia , Galang in Indonesia , Bataan in the Philippines and Songkla in Thailand . Some managed to travel as far as northern Australia in crowded , open boats . All foreign missionaries were expelled from Vietnam , including the most famous Salesian priest , Servant of God Andrej Majcen ( 19071999 ) from Yugoslavia ( now Slovenia ) too ; he however remained great friend of Vietnamese peoples during whole life . While most refugees were resettled to other countries within five years , others languished in these camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could not find asylum were deported back to Vietnam . Communities of Vietnamese refugees arrived in the US , Canada , Australia , France , West Germany , and the UK . The refugees often sent relief packages packed with necessities , such as medicines and sanitary goods to their relatives in Vietnam to help them survive . Very few would send money as it would be exchanged far below market rates by the Vietnamese government . Despite the defeat of South Vietnam , there was no serious demobilization of the Vietnamese People 's Army , which remained one of Asia 's largest militaries at over one million troops , or sign that warfare was coming to an end anytime soon . Not only were Vietnamese soldiers highly experienced from decades of fighting , but also had acquired a large cache of captured US and South Vietnamese armaments . Vietnam soon found itself drawn into conflict with Cambodia , which had been ruled by the communist Khmer Rouge since 1975 . In addition to this , Sino-Vietnamese relations deteriorated quite rapidly following Mao Zedong 's death in 1976 due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at odds with China during the 1970s . By 1978 , most trade and material assistance programs between the two countries had ceased and Vietnam forbade Chinese ships from docking at its ports . As the Khmer Rogue were allies of Beijing , this further aggravated tensions and following border skirmishes , the VPA launched a full-scale armed invasion of Cambodia during the first week of 1979 . Given the extreme brutality and mass murders committed by the Khmer Rouge ( which had killed or starved at least three million Cambodians ) , the international community could only consider the Vietnamese invasion a positive development . This had the effect however of causing conflict with China and during a visit to the US in February , Deng Xiaoping stated that It may be necessary to teach Vietnam a lesson . A large Chinese force invaded the Vietnamese border area , but with China still suffering the effects of the Cultural Revolution , the People 's Liberation Army was seriously deficient in training , equipment , and communications . Over 30,000 Chinese troops were killed or wounded in three weeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then in Cambodia and had no involvement in the war ) . Shortly afterwards , they withdrew with Beijing proclaiming that the aforementioned lesson had been taught as in any case , the fighting caused extensive destruction to Vietnam 's infrastructure along the border . The pro-Vietnamese People 's Republic of Kampuchea was created with Heng Samrin as Chairman . The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia had stopped the genocide of millions of Cambodians by the Khmer Rouge . Pol Pot 's Khmer Rouge allied with non-Communist guerilla forces led by Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann to fight against the Vietnamese forces and the new Phnom Penh regime . Some high-ranking officials of the Heng Samrin regime in the early 1980s resisted Vietnamese control , resulting in a purge that removed Pen Sovan , Prime Minister and General Secretary of the Kampuchean People 's Revolutionary Party . The war lasted until 1989 when Vietnam withdrew its troops and handed the administration of Cambodia to the United Nations . Vietnam 's third Constitution , based on that of the USSR , was written in 1980 . The Communist Party was stated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to lead the country . In 1980 , cosmonaut Phm Tun became the first Vietnamese and the first Asian to go into space , traveling on the Soviet Soyuz 37 to service the Salyut 6 space station . During the early 1980s , a number of overseas Vietnamese organizations were created with the aim of overthrowing the Vietnamese Communist government through armed struggle . Most groups attempted to infiltrate Vietnam but eventually were eliminated by Vietnamese security and armed forces . Overall , the first decade after reunification was not a happy time for the country . Nonstop warfare consumed large amounts of Vietnam 's resources , both financially and by depleting the labor force of young men . The country remained internationally isolated , having little contact with nations outside COMECON members , and faced with a huge , hostile neighbor to the north . Despite repeated overtures to the United States , attempts to reestablish diplomatic relation were hampered by the question of missing US soldiers from the war and President Ronald Reagan 's vocal hostility towards the country 's principle benefactor in Moscow . In a 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dong remarked Yes , we defeated the United States , but now we are a poor undeveloped nation and barely have enough to eat . Hence the saying that waging war is easy , but running a country is hard . Compounding all this was the complete failure of the Five Year Plan adopted in 1976 , as Vietnam remained one of the world 's poorest countries with a per-capita GDP of less than 300 USD and almost totally dependent on Soviet aid , which reached as much as 3 billion USD a year by 1982 . Moscow faced mounting pressure from its Warsaw Pact allies to reduce outlays to Vietnam . Soviet-Vietnamese relations were also harmed by the former 's wishes to have greater involvement in Vietnam 's economic development and increased access to military facilities . In 1982 , the VCP held its 5th National Congress in which General Secretary Le Duan stated that The Party wishes sternly to criticize itself . and Our nation 's manifold difficulties , while aggravated by outside circumstances that could not be helped , are nonetheless worsened by the various errors and shortcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average age of the party leadership , noting that there was only one person on the Central Committee under 60 . That year , a general purge of the party ranks began to weed out elderly and inefficient cadres and replace them with younger men . Vo Van Kiet , aged 59 , was promoted to head of the State Planning Commission , and 62-year old Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach was elevated to Politburo membership . More surprising was the removal of General Vo Nguyen Giap , considered a national hero , from the Politburo ( it was later speculated that he was removed by political rivals ) This rejuvenation campaign was nonetheless diminished by the fact that the country 's three most powerful individuals , Le Duan , Pham Van Dong , and President Truong Chinh , showed no sign of stepping down any time soon despite their combined age of 226 and clearly failing health ( all of them visited Moscow for medical treatment during 1982 ) . Although they saw the need for reforms and fighting corruption , such change was beyond their ability by this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and showed a clear move towards more market reforms and away from the rigid central planning of the 1976-80 scheme . Real change would not begin until the second half of the decade when Le Duan passed away in July 1986 , succeeded as General Secretary by Trng Chinh . However , Trng was expelled only five months later and replaced by Nguyen Van Linh , eight years his junior . Pham Van Dong retired as Premier in 1987 . Upon their accession , the country 's new leadership denounced their geriatric predecessors for utterly failing to improve the people 's living standards , check corruption , or instill a more flexible , non-dogmatic outlook on life . During the late 80s , Vietnam began tentative market reforms along the model then being adopted by China . The basis for these experiments were in the south which had a stronger tradition of trade and commerce . The perestroika policies of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev were also a source of motivation . Although communist governments in Eastern Europe were collapsing in 1989 , Vietnam was kept comparatively isolated from these events due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pro-democracy protests in Hanoi were quickly suppressed . The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused a thaw in the long hostile Sino-Vietnamese relations as the two nations embraced each other as some of the only surviving communist states . Soon after the Paris Agreement on Cambodia resolved the conflict in October 1991 , however , Vietnam established or reestablished diplomatic and economic relations with most of Western Europe , and several Asian countries . In February 1994 , the United States lifted its economic embargo against Vietnam , and in June 1995 , the United States and Vietnam normalized relations . In June 2005 , a high-level Vietnamese delegation , led by Prime Minister Phan Vn Khi , visited the United States and met with their U.S. counterparts , including President George W. Bush . This was the first such visit in 30 years . Although the visit mostly went well , a few embarrassing events occurred such as the White House 's official website ( www.whitehouse.gov ) accidentally depicted the flag of South Vietnam in its official announcement of the visit . This provoked dismay and hostile comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and corrected the webpage . In addition , a crowd of hostile protesters gathered outside the White House during Phan 's meeting with President Bush denouncing the Vietnamese Communist Party and waving South Vietnamese flags . In late 2005 , a three-person collective leadership was responsible for governing Vietnam . This triumvirate consisted of the VCP general secretary ( Nng c Mnh , 22 April 2001 19 January 2011 ) , the prime minister ( Phan Vn Khi , 25 September 1997 27 June 2006 ) , and the president ( Trn c Lng , 24 September 1997 26 June 2006 ) . General Secretary Manh headed up not only the VCP but also the 15-member Politburo . President Luong was chief of state , and Prime Minister Khai was head of government . The leadership was promoting a socialist-oriented market economy and friendly relations with the European Union , Russia , and the United States . Although the leadership was presiding over a period of rapid economic growth , official corruption and a widening gap between urban wealth and rural poverty remained stubborn problems that were eroding the VCP 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summit and became the 150th member state of WTO ( World Trade Organization ) on 11 January 2007 , after concluding bilateral agreements with the United States , Australia , New Zealand , Mexico , and the Dominican Republic in order to qualify for membership . In the summer of 2011 , spontaneous mass demonstrations erupted in Hanoi and Saigon , where thousands of Vietnamese protested China 's increasing military aggression and encroachment into Vietnamese waters and territories in the South China Sea . The authorities moved in to break up the protests after an official complaint was lodged by the Chinese embassy in Hanoi , as the VCP 's official policy since the 1990s has been one of good relations with Beijing and there was no desire on their part to disrupt the status quo . In 2013 , a baby girl named Nguyen Thi Thuy Dung was born and was chosen as Vietnam 's official 90th million citizen .

The Mukachevo one in Ukraine was never completed after the fall of the Soviet Union and the Skrunda facility was turned over to Latvia to be demolished . The Yeniseysk ( Krasnoyarsk ) Daryal-U site caused concern in the west over compliance with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty during its construction in the 1980s . Following years of negotiations , in September 1989 the Soviets admitted it was a violation of the treaty , construction ceased and the facility was eventually dismantled .

4 time = 03:00 AFT The Kandahar massacre , more precisely identified as the Panjwai massacre , occurred in the early hours of March 11 , 2012 , when United States Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales murdered sixteen civilians and wounded six others in the Panjwayi District of Kandahar Province , Afghanistan . Nine of his victims were children , and eleven of the dead were from the same family . Some of the corpses were partially burned . Bales was taken into custody later that morning when he told authorities , I did it . On August 23 , 2013 , a jury at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Fort Lewis , Washington sentenced him to life in prison without parole . American and International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) authorities apologized for the deaths . Afghan authorities condemned the act , describing it as intentional murder . The National Assembly of Afghanistan passed a resolution demanding a public trial in Afghanistan , but then-U.S . Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said the soldier would be tried under U.S. military law . Bales pleaded guilty on 5 June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecution not seeking the death penalty . At the time of the plea , he stated that he did not know why he committed the murders . United States authorities concluded that the killings were the act of a single individual . On 15 March 2012 , an Afghan parliamentary probe team made up of several members of the National Assembly of Afghanistan had speculated that up to 20 American soldiers were involved in the killings . The team later said they could not confirm claims that multiple soldiers took part in the killings . # Background # # The ' Surge ' in southern Afghanistan # Panjwai is the birthplace of the Taliban movement and has traditionally been a stronghold of theirs . It has been an area of heavy fighting and was the focus of a military surge in 2010 , which brought a more than two-fold increase in airstrikes , night raids into Afghan homes , insurgent casualties , and a six-fold increase in special forces operations throughout Afghanistan . Fighting in Panjwai and adjacent Zhari , Arghandab and Kandahar districts was particularly intense . Conflict between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale destruction of some villages by American forces , mass arrests , murder of civilians by rogue units , and high casualties from improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) . One of the families targeted in the Kandahar shootings had returned to the area in 2011 after previously being displaced by the surge . Fearing the Taliban but encouraged by the U.S. government , the Army , and the Afghan government , they settled near the American military base because they thought it would to be a safe place to live . Approximately three weeks before the incidents , U.S.Afghan relations were strained by an incident where copies of the Quran were burnt at the Bagram Air Base . A couple of months before the shootings , U.S. Marines were videotaped urinating on dead Taliban fighters . # Allegations of issues at Fort Lewis # The shooter , Robert Bales , was based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord ( JBLM ) . The primary medical treatment facility at the base , Madigan Army Medical Center , has come under investigation for downgrading diagnoses of soldiers with PTSD to lesser ailments . Military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not give returning troops sufficient time to recover before sending them on further deployments , and that the base 's medical unit is understaffed and overwhelmed by the numbers of returning veterans with deployment-related medical and psychological trauma . In April 2011 , a JBLM soldier killed his wife and 5-year-old son before killing himself . In January 2012 , a JBLM soldier murdered a Mount Rainier National Park ranger . In two separate incidents , unrelated JBLM soldiers have been charged with waterboarding their children . Jorge Gonzalez , executive director of a veterans resource center near Fort Lewis , said that the Kandahar killings offer more proof that the base is dysfunctional : This was not a rogue soldier . JBLM is a rogue base , with a severe leadership problem , he said in a statement . Base officials responded , saying that the crimes committed by its soldiers were isolated events which do not reflect on the work and dedication of all service members . Robert H. Scales , a retired U.S. Army major general and former commandant of the Army War College , suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infantry personnel in the last ten years for close combat in Iraq , Afghanistan , and elsewhere . # 8 March roadside bombing # Residents of Mokhoyan , a village about 500 metres east of Camp Belamby , stated that a bomb had exploded in their vicinity on 8 March , destroying an armored vehicle and wounding several U.S. soldiers . They recounted that U.S. soldiers afterwards lined many of the male villagers against a wall , threatening to get revenge for this incident by killing at least 20 of your people , and threatening that you and your children will pay for this . One Mokhoyan resident told ' ' The Associated Press ' ' It looked like they were going to shoot us , and I was very afraid . American officials from The Pentagon declared that they had no evidence that villagers had been lined up against a wall and threatened in Mokhoyan . U.S. officials refused to confirm or deny that American soldiers were wounded outside the village on 8 March . Bales ' lawyer , John Henry Browne , later stated that his client was upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion on 9 March . It is unclear whether the bombing cited by Browne was the same as the one described by the villagers . # Incident # # Killings # According to official reports , Bales left combat outpost Camp Belamby at 3:00 a.m. local time wearing night vision goggles . Bales was wearing traditional Afghan clothing over his ISAF fatigues . According to government officials with knowledge of the investigation , the killings were carried out in 2 phases , with Bales returning to base in between . An Afghan guard reported a soldier returning to base at 1:30 am , and another guard reported a soldier leaving at 2:30 am . Bales is believed to have first gone to Alkozai , about 1/2 mile north of Camp Belambay , then to Najiban ( called Balandi in earlier reports ) , located 1 1/2 miles south of the base . Four people were killed and six wounded in Alkozai , and 12 people were killed in Najiban . American sentries at the base heard gunshots in Alkozai , but did not take action besides attempting to view Alkozai from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. authorities recognized 16 people killed , including nine children , four men , and three women . On 22 March that number was revised to 17 , but later reduced back to 16 . It was initially reported that five others were injured , and that number was eventually increased to six . Four members of the same family were killed in Alkozai . According to a 16-year-old boy who was shot in the leg , Bales woke up his family members before shooting them . Another witness said she saw the man drag a woman out of her house and repeatedly hit her head against a wall . The first victim in Najiban appears to have been Mohammad Dawood . According to Dawood 's brother , Bales shot Dawood in the head , but spared Dawood 's wife and six children after the wife screamed at him . Eleven members of Abdul Samad 's family were killed in a house in Najiban village , including his wife , four girls between the ages of 2 and 6 , four boys between 8 and 12 , and two other relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their hair and shot them in the mouth . At least three of the child victims were killed by a single shot to the head of each . Their bodies were then set on fire . Then another civilian , Mohammad Dawoud , age 55 , was killed in another house in this village . Witnesses reported that Bales was wearing a headlamp and/or a spotlight attached to his weapon . Bales burned some of the victims ' bodies , an act considered desecration under Islamic law . Witnesses said that the eleven corpses from one family were shot in the head , stabbed , then gathered into one room and set on fire . A pile of ashes was found on the floor of one victims ' house ; at least one child 's body was found partially charred . A reporter for ' ' The New York Times ' ' inspected the children 's bodies taken to a nearby American military base and reported seeing burns on some of the legs and heads . # Surrender and confession # Following the events at Alkozai and Balandi , Bales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him leaving his outpost before the killings and U.S. commanders on base assembled their troops for a head count when it was discovered that the soldier was missing . A patrol was dispatched to find the missing soldier , but did not find him before he returned to base after the killings . He was reportedly taken into custody without incident . There were no military operations being conducted in the area at the time of the shootings . The surveillance video from the base reportedly shows the soldier walking up to his base covered in a traditional Afghan shawl . The soldier removes the shawl and lays his weapon on the ground , then raises his arms in surrender . The video has not been released to the public . American investigators suspect that Bales may have departed the base before midnight , committed the murders in Balandi , then returned to the base around 1:30 a.m . Bales may have then departed the base at 2:30 a.m. and committed the murders in Alkozai . It was apparently the second departure which caused the alert and the commencement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense officials , upon his return to the base Bales said three words : I did it and then told individuals what happened . Later he retained a lawyer and refused to speak further with investigators . The United States flew Bales out of Afghanistan to Kuwait on 14 March 2012 , then to the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas on 16 March . A Pentagon spokesman said the move was done because of a legal recommendation . # The number of assailants # According to U.S. authorities , a single soldier Staff Sergeant Robert Bales conducted the attack . The U.S. military showed Afghan authorities the footage from the surveillance video at the base as proof that there was only one perpetrator of the shootings . According to Reuters , some neighbors and relatives of the dead saw a group of U.S. soldiers arrive at their village at about 2 a.m. , enter homes and open fire . They were all drunk and shooting all over the place , said neighbor Agha Lala . According to ' ' The New York Times ' ' , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villagers described seeing a number of soldiers , while some other Afghan residents described seeing only one gunman . One mother-of-six , whose husband was killed during the incident , reported involvement of a large number of people : When they shot dead my husband , I tried to drag him into the house .. I saw more than 20 people when I looked out the house . The Americans pointed their guns at me and threatened me , telling me not to leave the house or they 'd kill me . An eight-year-old girl named Noorbinak , whose father was killed reported that one man entered the room and the others were standing in the yard , holding lights . The brother of another victim claimed his nephews and nieces had seen numerous soldiers with headlamps and lighted guns . Some elected officials said that they believed the attack was planned , claiming that one soldier could not have carried out such an act without help . In response , Afghan President Hamid Karzai appointed General Sher Mohammad Karimi to investigate the claims . On 15 March 2012 , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Assembly of Afghanistan announced that up to 20 American soldiers were involved in the killings , with support from two helicopters . They had spent two days in the province on site , interviewing the survivors and collecting evidence . One of the members of the probe team , Hamizai Lali , said : We closely examined the site of the incident , talked to the families who lost their beloved ones , the injured people and tribal elders .. The villages are one and a half kilometre from the American military base . We are convinced that one soldier can not kill so many people in two villages within one hour .. the victims have been killed by the two groups . Lali asked the Afghan government , the United Nations and the international community to ensure the perpetrators were punished in Afghanistan . While visiting one of the affected villages , Hamid Karzai pointed to one of the villagers and said : In his family , in four rooms people were killed children and women were killed and then they were all brought together in one room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not do . However , the team later said they could not confirm that multiple soldiers took part in the killings . # Financial payments to victims ' families # On 25 March 2012 at the office of the governor of Kandahar province , the United States gave the equivalent of US$860,000 to the victims ' families , allocated as $50,000 for each person killed and $10,000 for each person injured . The official who disbursed payments to the families said the money was not compensation , but rather the U.S. government 's offering to help the victims and their families . A member of the Kandahar provincial council described the payments as assistance , but not as the kind of legal compensation that would absolve the accused . # Robert Bales # The Army alleged that Robert Bales , a 38-year-old United States Army Staff Sergeant stationed at Camp Belambay , was the only person responsible for the shootings . According to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta , immediately after being captured , Bales acknowledged the killings and told individuals what happened . He then asked for an attorney and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to officials , Bales may have been having marital problems , and the investigation of the shootings is looking into the possibility that an e-mail about marriage problems might have provoked Bales . His wife wrote on her blog about her disappointment after he was passed over for a promotion to Sergeant First Class ( E-7 ) . The family was also struggling with finances , and three days before the shootings Bales ' wife put their home up for sale , as they had fallen behind with mortgage payments . On March 23 , 2012 , the U.S. government charged Bales with 17 counts of murder , six counts of attempted murder , and six counts of assault . On March 24 , 2012 , American investigators said they believe Bales split the killings in the villages of Balandi and Alkozai into two attacks , returning to Camp Belamby after the first attack before slipping out again an hour later . No other U.S. military personnel were disciplined for having any role in the incident . On August 22 , 2013 , Bales pled guilty at his General Court-martial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an act of cowardice . The plea spared Bales from the death penalty . On August 23 , 2013 , Bales was sentenced to life in prison without parole by the court . He was also demoted to Private ( E-1 ) , the lowest possible rank , dishonorably discharged , and ordered to forfeit all pay and allowances . A commanding general overseeing the court-martial has the option of reducing the sentence to life with the possibility of parole . Afghan villagers and the families of Bales ' victims were upset by the decision saying he deserved death . Abdul Samad , a 60-year old farmer who lost 11 family members , eight of whom were children , spoke about the incident : I do n't know why they killed them . Our government told us to come back to the village , and then they let the Americans kill us . One grieving mother , holding a dead baby in her arms , said , They killed a child , was this child the Taliban ? Believe me , I have n't seen a 2-year-old member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want money , I do n't want a trip to Mecca , I do n't want a house . I want nothing . But what I absolutely want is the punishment of the Americans . This is my demand , my demand , my demand and my demand , said one villager , whose brother was killed . More than 300 Panjwai locals gathered around the military base to protest the killings . Some brought burned blankets to represent those killed . In one house , an elderly woman screamed : May God kill the only son of Karzai , so he feels what we feel . On 13 March , hundreds of university students protested in Afghanistan 's eastern city of Jalalabad , shouting Death to America Death to Obama and burning effigies of the U.S. president and a Christian cross . On 15 March about 2,000 people took part in another protest , in the southern province of Zabul. # Reaction from Afghan authorities # The President of Afghanistan , Hamid Karzai , called the incident intentional murder and stated this was an assassination , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said the United States must now pull back its troops from village areas and allow Afghan security forces to take the lead in an effort to reduce civilian deaths . On 16 March Karzai said the U.S. was not fully co-operating with a probe into the killings . He also said the problem of civilian casualties at the hands of NATO forces has been going on for too long .. It is by all means the end of the rope here . A spokesperson for the Afghan Interior Ministry condemned the act in the strongest possible terms . Afghan politicians wanted Bales to face an Afghan court . The National Assembly of Afghanistan insisted that the U.S. soldier be put on public trial in Afghanistan : We seriously demand and expect that the government of the United States punish the culprits and try them in a public trial before the people of Afghanistan . It also condemned the killings as brutal and inhuman and declared that people are running out of patience over the ignorance of foreign forces . Abdul Rahim Ayobi , a member of parliament from Kandahar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American soldiers are out of the control of their generals . Kamal Safai , a member from Kunduz , said that while it was the act of a single man , the public reaction will blame the government of America , not the soldier . # Reaction from U.S. and NATO # American and ISAF forces apologized and promised a full investigation , with Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stating that the soldier will be brought to justice and be held accountable and that the death penalty could be a consideration . U.S. president Barack Obama called the incident absolutely tragic and heartbreaking but noted that he was proud generally of what U.S. troops have accomplished in Afghanistan . Obama said the incident did not represent the exceptional character of the American military and the respect that the United States had for the people of Afghanistan . On 13 March , he said , the United States takes this as seriously as if it were our own citizens and our own children who were murdered . Were heartbroken over the loss of innocent life . The killing of innocent civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter asking whether the killings could be likened to the 1968 My Lai massacre of civilians by U.S. forces in South Vietnam , Obama replied , It 's not comparable . It appeared you had a lone gunman who acted on his own . General John R. Allen , commander of the ISAF , issued an apology as well . Adrian Bradshaw , the deputy commander of the NATO forces in Afghanistan , apologized I wish to convey my profound regrets and dismay .. I can not explain the motivation behind such callous acts , but they were in no way part of authorised ISAF military activity . A rapid and thorough inquiry was promised . U.S. officials said the killings would not affect their strategies in the area . # Reaction from the Taliban # The Taliban said in a statement on its website that sick-minded American savages committed the blood-soaked and inhumane crime . The militant group promised the families of the victims that it would take revenge for every single martyr . The Taliban also accused Afghan security officials of being complicit in the attack . The militant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly rampage . On 13 March , the Taliban launched an attack on an Afghan government delegation which was visiting the site of the killings , killing one government soldier and injuring three . # See also # * List of massacres in Afghanistan * War in Afghanistan ( 2001present ) * Khosrow Sofla ( Afghanistan , 2010 ) * Maywand District murders ( Afghanistan , 2010 ) # References # 
4 In vibrational spectroscopy , an overtone band is the spectral band that occurs in a vibrational spectrum of a molecule when the molecule makes a transition from the ground state ( v=0 ) to the second excited state ( v=2 ) , where v is the vibrational quantum number that one gets after solving the Schrdinger equation for the molecule under consideration . It takes only non-negative integer values . Generally , in order to study the vibrational spectra of molecules , the vibration of the chemical bonds is assumed to be simple harmonic.Thus the parabolic simple harmonic potential is used in the Schrdinger equation to solve for the vibrational energy eigenstates . When the Schrdinger equation is solved one gets the functional forms of the vibrational energy eigenstates . These energy states are found to be quantised , meaning they can assume only some discrete values of energy . When electromagnetic radiation is shined on a sample of a molecule , the molecules can absorb energy from the electromagnetic radiation and change their vibrational energy state . However , the molecules can absorb energy from radiation only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the electric dipole moment of the molecule when it is vibrating . This change in the electric dipole moment of the molecule leads to the transition dipole moment of the molecule , for transition from the lower to higher energy state , being non-zero which is an essential condition for any transition ( process , change ) to take place in the vibrational state of the molecule , as is the law of nature , explained thoroughly in Quantum mechanics . It has been found that , when the bonds are considered vibrating simple-harmonically , the transition dipole moment is non-zero only for the transition where v=1 . Hence ; for the ideal , non-existent , simple-harmonically vibrating bond ; there can never be any overtone observed in the vibrational spectrum . But , real molecules do not vibrate simple-harmonically . The potential function vibration is not parabolic , simple-harmonic potential , but is better approximated by the Morse potential . When Schrdinger equation is solved for the molecule under consideration with Morse potential as the potential function , one gets the functional forms of the vibrational energy eigenstates with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding to transitions from various energy levels to various other energy levels , the transition dipole moment does not become zero for the transitions where v=2 , 3 , 4 , etc . Thus , for real molecules , the allowed transitions are those for which v=1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc . The overtone band observed in the IR spectrum is one such transition with v=2 , from v=0 to v=2 energy state . However it has been experimentally found that the intensity of the overtone band is very low compared to the fundamental band .

He represented North Battleford from 1908 to 1917 and Jack Fish Lake from 1917 to 1934 in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as a Liberal . He was born in Elgin County , Ontario , the son of Duncan Finlayson and Annabel Matheson , both natives of Scotland . He moved to Battleford , Saskatchewan in 1879 . In 1881 , Finlayson married his wife Katie . Their home was ravaged during the North-West Rebellion of 1885 but the family were not at home , having been warned in advance . Finlayson served with local militia during the rebellion . He was president of the North Battleford Agricultural Society . # References #

69514 Henry Nugent Bell ( 17921822 ) was an Irish genealogist . # Biography # He was the eldest son of George Bell , Esq. , of Belleview , County Fermanagh ( Inner Temple Admission Register ) . He followed the profession of a legal antiquary , and , in order to obtain a recognised status , entered himself at the Inner Temple , 17 Nov. 1818 . In the same year he acquired considerable distinction by his successful advocacy of the claim of Mr. Hastings to the long-dormant earldom of Huntingdon ; the estates , however , with the exception , it is said , of a mill in Yorkshire , had died from the title , and were legally invested in the Earl of Moira 's family . Bell published a detailed account of the proceedings in ' ' The Huntingdon Peerage ' ' , 4to , London , 1820 , pp. 413 , and the narrative of his various adventures , which are given at length , displays a suspicious luxuriance of imagination not altogether in keeping with what professed to be a grave genealogical treatise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affixed in 1821 , with a genealogical table and additional portraits . Bell was also employed by Mr. J. L. Crawford to further his claim to the titles and estates of Crawford and Lindsay , and , if we may credit the common report , received no less a sum than 5,036/. for prosecuting the suit . He was cut off before he could bring the matter to a decisive issue , and dying in- solvent , the unfortunate claimant 's money was in a great measure lost . According to Lady Anne Hamilton , Bell , with other minions , was delegated by Lord Sidmouth in 1819 to incite the starving people of Manchester against the ministry , and by their means the meeting of 16 Aug. was convoked which led to the Peterloo massacre . The circumstances attending his death as narrated in the journals of the day were somewhat tragic . An action to recover a sum of money advanced to him by an engraver named Cooke was tried on 18 Oct. 1822 , and a verdict passed against him ; on the same evening he died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
76514 Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis Hall , formerly known as Milton Hall , is a residence hall on the campus of George Washington University ( GW ) , located at 2222 I St. , Northwest , Washington , D.C. in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood . # History # The building was designed by Robert O. Scholz and was built in 1938 . The building is similar in style as the neighboring Munson Hall . It is eight-stories tall , and features two bays . The exterior is faced with buff brick . The main entrance is in the recessed space between the two bays . Cast stone scrollwork is found over the door and surrounding the first floor and eighth floor windows . There are three medallions on each bay along a horizontal cast stone band above the sixth floor . In 1995 the building was named for Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis , who graduated from GW in 1951 . It was listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites and the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. 
94514 Giuseppe Antonio Torri ( 1655&amp;ndash ; c. 1713 ) was an Italian architect of the early 18th century . He was born and died in Bologna , where he was active in a late-Baroque style . His surname is also spelled Trri . He initially trained with his father , Giovanni Battista . On March 30 , 1697 , he was appointed architect to the Senate of Bologna . He worked on the designs used to reconstruct the Collegio Germanico-Ungarico ( 1700 ) , now a seminary . He helped design the building 's interior courtyard . In 1703 , he designed the present building for the parish church of San Tommaso dal Mercate , which was completed by Giovanni Antonio Taruffi . He is said to have invented machinery ( ' ' trafila ' ' , 1710 ) for the mint at Bologna ; and helped with the building of the astronomical observatory at the University of Bologna . Other buildings in Bologna to which he contributed include the church of San Gabriele ( begun 1700 , finished 1720 ) , the palazzo San Giorgio ( 1709 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1708 ) . He contributed some designs for the church of the Santissima Trinita that had been begun by F. Martini in 1662 . He also contributed some plans , at a distance , for a palazzo that William III of England contemplated . The building presently housing the Court of Appeals in Bologna , the Palazzo Baciocchi , previously Ranuzzi , has a grand staircase designed by Torri . He also contributed to reconstructions and modernizations at Palazzo Scarani , Palazzo Isolani de San Stefano , and Palazzo Pepoli . Among his pupils was Alfonso Torreggiani. # Sources # * *

Burstall made the film as part of a deliberate effort to move away from ocker material . He was attracted to Braddon 's novel because it would be simple to film as it was basically a two hander , while also preparing ' ' Eliza Fraser ' ' ( 1976 ) . The movie was budgeted at $244,000 but eventually cost $294,000 . Shooting commenced in January 1975 . The two leads , George Mallaby and John Waters , were familiar faces on Australian television at the time . # Reception # The film performed reasonably at the box-office and in 1979 reported that it had just broken even . It also rated highly on television , the rights for which earned Heaxgon $70,000 . Burstall admitted the film might have been more effective as a TV movie but says it would have been harder to make a profit that way .

4 issn = 0163-7266 ' ' Railroad &amp; Railroad ' ' was the first magazine title created in-house by Carstens Publications . Based in Newton , New Jersey , the magazine is produced monthly , edited by Steve Barry . As a magazine dedicated to trains and rail transportation , it stands out from its main competitor ' ' Trains ' ' as a publication focused on the enthusiast and related activities . It is also the successor to Railroad magazine , purchased by Carstens in 1979 , and listed separately on the masthead to this day . # Founding and early days # As early as 1968 , future ' ' Railroad Model Craftsman ' ' editor Tony Koester visited publisher Harold Carstens to pitch an idea for a railfan 's magazine , at the insitance of his friend Jim Boyd ( who was at the time an occasional contributor to RMC ) . At the time , Carstens cited the lack of potential advertisers and stiff competition from the long-established ' ' Trains ' ' and ' ' Railroad ' ' magazines as a reason for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial meeting , Carstens did make an offer to Koester to join the staff of RMC . With this rapid modernization , many historic pieces of vintage railroad equipment were scrapped , though a great many more were saved , thanks to the rise in railfan activity and the development and support of the railway preservation movement . By the mid-1970s , preparations were underway to celebrate the nation 's bicentennial , and with it came a renewed interest in railroad heritage , namely the return of several steam locomotives to main line excursion service . Amidst all of this change , ' ' Railfan &amp; Railroad ' ' not only reported on these activities , but also encouraged them and the railfan culture . Response to the new magazine was favorable , and ' ' Railfan ' ' went to a bi-monthly schedule starting with the August 1977 issue . Part of the success of the new magazine has been attributed to Boyd 's skill as a photographer and writer , as well as his real-world railroading experience and his personality . Upon the purchase of the defunct ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Railfan &amp; Railroad ' ' starting with the May 1979 issue . The masthead of current issues continues to list the publication serials of both titles individually . Incremental changes to update the look and feel of the magazine began in 2010 , when a new logo debuted to replace an earlier redeisgn dating from 1999 . At the end of 2010 , Editor Emeritus Jim Boyd suffered a heart attack and died near his home in Newton . In 2011 , Otto Vondrak joined the staff as associate editor after working as a contractor and freelancer for the previous year . Since its beginning , the editorial style of the magazine tends to be focused on the active enthusiast who is more likely to be engaged in the hobby by taking photographs of current railroad operations , visiting museums and tourist lines , and contributing to historical preservation activities . Topics range from the historic to the contemporary , and includes news photos and monthly columns to balance out the feature content . The magazine continues its focus on the railroad enthusiast , thanks in part to editor Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enthusiasm for photography . The majority of content is contributed by the readers of the magazine , with the editors appearing as-needed . In December 2011 , ' ' Railfan &amp; Railroad ' ' expanded its reach with the debut of digital editions for home computers , laptops , and select mobile digital devices . # Monthly columns # A slate of regular contributors author the monthly columns ( Departments ) that appear in ' ' Railfan &amp; Railroad ' ' magazine opposite the feature content .

4 ' ' Green v Lord Somerleyton ' ' 2003 EWCA Civ 198 is an English land law case , concerning easements. # Facts # Green had dykes . Water from Lord Someleytons land drained into the dykes , and Green brought an action in nuisance to stop it happening after a serious flood that came from a lake on Somerleytons property . Water had flowed from it through marshland . The trustees of Lord Somerleytons land counterclaimed that they had an easement for the water drainage , from a 1921 conveyance by implied reservation . Judge held there was no remedy in nuisance for naturally flowing water under ' ' Leakey v National Trust ' ' 1980 QB 485. # Judgment # Jonathan Parker LJ held that nuisance could cover floodwater . But Green had not made clear what action they ought to take , nor had he taken action to reduce risk himself . Furthermore , the provisions in the drainage deed were incorporated by reference into the conveyance to Green , and by implication those drainage rights were intended to be proprietary . So Somerleyton did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purpose of draining the said lands i.e. Scale Marshes and Priory Marshes and effectually drain the same . # 116 . It also imposed obligations on the purchaser , Mr Mallett , to keep the dykes on Priory Marshes cleansed and open and in proper order . 117 . Given the terms of the 1921 Drainage Deed , and their express incorporation by reference into the 1921 Conveyance , the conclusion seems to me to be inescapable that the 1921 Conveyance impliedly reserved to Lord Somerleyton and his successors in title to Scale Marshes an easement of drainage through the existing dykes in the terms claimed by the Trustees . 
4 In computer programming , package principles are a way of organizing classes in larger systems to make them more organized and manageable . They help us understand which classes should go into which packages called package cohesion and how these packages should relate with one another called package coupling . Package principles also includes software package metrics , which help us quantify the dependency structure we design , thereby giving us different or more precise insights into the overall structure of our classes and packages . # Overview # # Principles of package cohesion # 1 . Reuse-release equivalence principle ( REP ) : REP essentially means that the package must be created with reusable classes Either all of the classes inside the package are reusable , or none of them are . The classes must also be of the same family . We do nt want to include classes that are unrelated to the purpose of the package . If we construct a package as a family of reusable classes , we can more closely guarantee a focused , reusable package . 2 . Common-reuse principle ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reused together belong in the same package together . It is a way of helping us decide which classes belong in which package . : We also want to keep in mind that when we depend on a package , we want to make sure that the classes are inseparable , and interdependent , which is also handy when culling out classes that do or do nt belong . 3 . Common-closure principle ( CCP ) : CCP states that the package should not have more than one reason to change . If change were to happen in an application dependent on a number of packages , ideally we only want changes to occur in one package , rather than in a number of them . : This helps us determine classes that are likely to change and package them together for the same reasons . If the classes are tightly coupled , put them in the same package . # Principles of package coupling # 1 . Acyclic dependencies principle ( ADP ) : In a development cycle with multiple developers , cooperation and integration needs to happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no cycles in the dependency structure , and that when an incremental release is made , the other developers can adopt and build upon it . 2 . Stable-dependencies principle ( SDP ) : Designs , by nature of the environments they are used in or by , are changing . So we need to design our packages to be able to change as well . The SDP states that any packages we want to be volatile should not be depended on by a package that is difficult to change . 3 . Stable-abstractions principle ( SAP ) : The SAP says that a stable package should also be abstract so that its stability does not prevent it from being extended . It also states that an instable package should be concrete since its instability allows the concrete code within it to be easily changed .

4 ' ' Inocybe salicis ' ' is an uncommon species of fungus found in association with willow in Europe . The species produces small , brown or yellow mushrooms with caps up to 2.5cm 1 across , with stems up to 3.5 cm long . The species is similar in appearance to several other closely related species in the genus ' ' Inocybe ' ' that also associate with willow , and so is most reliably differentiated microscopically. # Taxonomy and phylogeny # ' ' Inocybe salicis ' ' was described and named by Robert Khner in 1955 in the ' ' Bulletin Trimestriel de la Socit Mycologique de France ' ' . ' ' Inocybe straminipes ' ' is a synonym of ' ' I. salicis ' ' . The former was originally described in 1979 by Henri Romagnesi , and had different spores from those of ' ' I. salicis ' ' . However , the holotype was reexamined in 2009 by Ukka Vauras and Katri Kokkonen , who observed that the spores were in fact identical to those of ' ' I. salicis ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The specific epithet ' ' salicis ' ' is in reference to ' ' Salix ' ' , the generic name for willow . Within the genus ' ' Inocybe ' ' , ' ' I. salicis ' ' belongs to the section ' ' Marginatae ' ' , which also includes ' ' I. obtusiuscula ' ' , ' ' I. dunensis ' ' , ' ' I. salicis-herbaceae ' ' , ' ' I. substellata ' ' , ' ' I. praetervisa ' ' , ' ' I. saliceticola ' ' and ' ' I. mixtilis ' ' . These species are all known to associate with willow , and all have macroscopic similarities . As such , they are best differentiated microscopically. # Description # ' ' Inocybe salicis ' ' mushrooms have tawny to yellowish-brown caps of between 1and2.5cm in in diameter . Their surface can be cracked , covered in fibres or scaly . The caps change in shape as the mushrooms mature ; while younger specimens have campanulate ( bell-shaped ) to conical caps , the caps of older specimens expand and flatten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cutis . The gills are almost free , meaning that they only just connect to the stem , and are initially a pale grey , becoming an ochre-grey ( or brownish ) as they age . The stem has a white to honey-coloured surface entirely covered in powdery granules . The stem is 1.5to3.5cm in long by 0.4to1cm in thick . There is a well-defined bulb at the base of the stem . The white flesh smells spermatic , but the scent is not distinctive . # Microscopic characteristics # ' ' Inocybe salicis ' ' produces spores of 9 to 11 by 6 to 8 micrometers ( m ) . In shape , they are elongated or curved , but they are covered with 10 to 15 distinctive blunt , semi-circular projections . The cystidia on the face and edge of the gills measure 50 to 70 by 12 to 25 m with a cell wall 2 to 3 m thick , and either taper at each end , or are shaped like swollen bottles , with the cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) more variable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are club- or balloon-shaped , and caulocystidia can be found all the way down the stem . # Distribution and habitat # ' ' Inocybe salicis ' ' favours wet land in willow woodland and clearings . Although widespread throughout its range in Europe , it is not commonly encountered . 
4 ' ' Setiostoma dietzi ' ' is a species of sedge moths in the genus ' ' Setiostoma ' ' . It was described by Duckworth in 1971 . It is found in the humid low highlands of western Venezuela , central Colombia and Costa Rica . The wingspan is 1115 mm . The forewings are yellow basally to just before the midpoint , the distal margin of the yellow area runs straight from the costa to the dorsum and is bordered by a dark brown line .

69514 ' ' Eremita ' ' is the fourth studio solo album by former Emperor frontman Ihsahn . The album features guest appearances by several notable musicians , including Devin Townsend and Jeff Loomis of Nevermore . # Background # The album is Ihsahn 's first solo outing since the conclusion of the conceptual trilogy encompassing his first three albums , ' ' The Adversary ' ' , ' ' angL ' ' , and ' ' After ' ' . Ihsahn said that ' ' Eremita ' ' was the product of an intentional contrast with ' ' After ' ' . He described ' ' After ' ' as a very desolate , bleak landscape . There were no signs of life in any of the lyrics , while , for ' ' Eremita ' ' , the atmosphere is much more introverted , much more paranoid and kind of schizophrenic . I tend to bring up many of the same themes , but lyrically it comes from a different perspective . The album 's sense of introversion , paranoia , and schizophrenia is represented in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nietzsche turned to Nietzsche 's mad final years . Nietzsche is represented in the cover , which features an upside-down image of his face from later in his life , when he was on the verge of insanity . As Ihsahn explained , ' ' Eremita ' ' is a reflective album thats filtered through the eyes of a madman . He elaborated upon the connection , explaining that There 's an escapism to this album , there 's a paranoia , a lot of issues that are dealt with , and these pictures of Nietzsche are from very close to when he tipped over into madness . # Guest Appearances # ' ' Eremita ' ' featured a guest appearance by Devin Townsend . Previously , Ihsahn had guested on Townsend 's album , ' ' Deconstruction ' ' . Jens Bogren , who mixed ' ' Deconstruction ' ' , was also tapped to mix ' ' Eremita ' ' .

In his review of the Broadway production , Charles Isherwood of ' ' The New York Times ' ' wrote : The cast of this alternately snarky and sentimental show about rival high school cheer squads often seems to be in constant motion , tumbling and flipping across the stage in elaborate routines that culminate in towering formations of human pyramids ...

Her first album of all-original material since 2006 's ' ' The Greatest ' ' , it was released on September 3 , 2012 , in the United Kingdom and in the United States on September 4 , 2012 , via Matador Records . The album was issued in a variety of formats , including a limited edition deluxe LP containing a 7 vinyl of bonus tracks . The album 's lead single , Ruin , was released for free download at Matador Record 's store on June 20 , 2012 . A music video for album opener Cherokee , directed by Marshall , has recently been released , while an ambient remix of the song by Nicolas Jaar is available to download from Cat Power 's official website . The song was premired on NPR 's ' ' All Songs Considered ' ' on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as going in yet another direction . A lot more drive , a lot more electronics , drum machines , synthsit 's very bold . On April 10 , 2013 , Cat Power performed the previously unreleased track Bully on the premier episode of the forty-second series of Later .. with Jools Holland . Immediately following the broadcast , a new version of the album containing Bully as a bonus track was made available for download through iTunes. # Background and recording # Work on the album initially began soon after the release of ' ' The Greatest ' ' , with Marshall announcing the album 's title as far back as 2006 in an interview with ' ' The New York Times ' ' , where she also claimed that the entire album had already been written . Marshall decided to finance the recording of ' ' Sun ' ' herself , following financial difficulties arising from the cancellation of a lengthy tour in 2006 due to her hospitalisation . She was later declared bankrupt , claiming I had my house in foreclosure and I had n't paid taxes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessing me and wondering what I was going to do with the advance for this album , I said , ' I 'm going to fucking pay for this shit myself . ' I knew that 'd be the only way I could control things . So I cashed out my retirement fund . Recording began sometime in 2007 , with Marshall building a studio in her Malibu home to record and produce new songs herself . However , much of the material recorded up to this point was later abandoned when Marshall decided it was too painful and personal to put out , stating I was writing all these really slow guitar songs , and my friend said , ' This is like depressing old Cat Power , ' which made me feel like I got shot . I did n't work for eight months after that . Progress on the album was delayed again with the recording and release of her second covers album ' ' Jukebox ' ' in 2008 , and later by her relationship with Giovanni Ribisi . Following the tour in support of ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studio in Silverlake , California , where she began work on newly written , electronic material , with Marshall claiming , I had no fucking idea what to do , but I knew I was not going to even look at a piano or touch a guitar . So I started out with a weird synthesizer . Eventually I had these skeletons of songs , but then I felt like a failure because I thought , ' This is not fucking good , I do n't know what I 'm doing . ' And I did n't know what I was doing . I had lyrics and a beat and notes , but I did n't have anything else . It sounded like a naked , shivering alien . This period of inactivity placed a strain on Marshall 's relationship with her label Matador who , concerned by the lack of progress , began pressuring Marshall to work with a producer . Marshallwho had n't worked with a producer since Ed Douglas recorded both ' ' Dear Sir ' ' and ' ' Myra Lee ' ' on the same day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a producer is like telling someone that they need a nose job . It activates something in you that makes you feel like a loser . It was around this time that Marshall regrouped at her home in Malibu with members of her backing band , the Dirty Delta Blues , to start preparation for a tour in the beginning of 2011 . Rehearsing many of the skeletal new compositions she had written , the band would go on to perform ten previously unreleased songs over the course of the tour ; including Cherokee , Ruin , Real Life and Human Being , as well as another six that would later be excluded from the album Bully , Brave Liar , Horizon , Let Me Go , Monster and Woman of My Word . Hoping to rerecord these songs with the band following completion of the tour , these sessions , according to Marshall , did n't work out the way she hoped , noting that Ruin is the only song on the album to feature contributions from the Dirty Delta Blues band . Production for the album continued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instrumentation from the aborted Dirty Blues Band sessions . After hearing a song from the Beastie Boys album ' ' Hot Sauce Committee Part Two ' ' on the radio , she contacted that album 's mixer , Cassius member Philippe Zdar , in the hope of a potential collaboration . Unable to pay Zdar for his mixing work until the album was finalised and presented to Matador for release , she transferred her work to Zdar 's recording studio in Francewhere he worked pro bonountil sessions for the album finally concluded in April 2012. # Critical reception # The album received generally positive reviews from music critics upon its release . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 78 , based on 44 reviews , which indicates generally favorable reviews . AllMusic editor Heather Phares , in a very positive review , commented that the album 's remarkably spare production aesthetic sounds all the more striking coming after ' ' The Greatest s lushness and said that Marshall 's willingness and ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds is n't such a far cry from the more sonically adventurous moments on ' ' Moon Pix ' ' and especially ' ' You Are Free ' ' ; she 's just expanding on that instinct and adding a more hopeful songwriting bent . ' ' Magnet ' ' commented that this is easily her fullest-sounding , most animated record to date , awarding the album 4 stars out of 5 . Similarly , Drowned in Sound reviewer Hayley Avron referred to ' ' Sun ' ' as the most rounded and accomplished album of Cat Power 's career , elaborating that it seemed that she may have reached a creative peak with ' ' The Greatest ' ' , which signified a definitive leap in her musical evolution . That wheel kept on turning though , and ' ' Sun ' ' marks an even bolder step forward ; the songs sound light and layered with space and sound and is rich with an air of experimentation , with none of the pitfalls of amateurism that often accompany such forays into musical exploration . ' ' Rolling Stone ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most emotionally intense songwriters around , but with ' ' Sun ' ' she has made her riskiest , most vital album , not to mention one of her greatest . Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly stated that Marshall has never sounded more confident or in control than she does on ' ' Sun ' ' , awarding the album a grade of A. James Skinner of BBC Music gave the album a positive review , noting that if there is nothing here as instantly transfixing as some of her past work , ' ' Sun ' ' comes alive on closer listening , revealing myriad depths and unexpected vocal turns . Consequence of Sound editor Sarah Grant called ' ' Sun ' ' a passionate pop album of electronic music filtered through a singer-songwriter 's soul , while ' ' The Fly ' ' reviewer Sophie Thomsett said that the album has transformation and catharsis seeping through every note , before summarising that at its peak , ' ' Sun ' ' reaches greatness , specifically with both Manhattan and the 11-minute opus ' Nothin ' But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best material she 's ever penned , with both writers awarding the album 4.5 out of 5 stars . Stephen Deusner of ' ' Paste ' ' said that the album was absolutely fascinating in its humanity and compassion , awarding the album 8.0 out of 10 . Matthew Foster of The Quietus , in a positive review , said that ' ' Sun ' ' is about as cathartic as pop gets and described the album as the light at the end of one hell of a tunnel , a record brimming with an assurance and playfulness . Anna Wilson of ' ' Clash ' ' rated it six out of ten and said the album was a robust , respectable detour , but will leave some fans pining for the smoky chanteuse of old . Andy Gill of ' ' The Independent ' ' commented on Marshall 's change in musical direction , saying that she abandoned her soul charm for something much less appealing , while claiming that the overdubbing process turns tracks like Nothin ' But Time into trudges , awarding the album 3 stars out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin Trunick said that the album is n't likely to land among the singer-songwriter 's best records , but it 's clear , however , that her heart went into it , rating the album 3 out of 5. # Accolades # The album was included in several year-end lists by music critics and publications . ' ' Rolling Stone ' ' magazine , in their list of the 50 Best Albums of 2012 , ranked it at sixteenth place , writing the idea of the brilliantly morose Chan Marshall making a dance-rock record is almost absurd . Yet the groove-powered ' ' Sun ' ' is a perfect fit . The A.V. Club placed the album at number twenty-two on their list of the Best Albums of 2012 . Billboard also placed the album at number nine in their list of the 10 Best Albums of 2012 . ' ' The L.A. Times ' ' and ' ' Filter ' ' magazine both placed the album at number six in their lists of the best albums of 2012 .

4 The concept of the Malay world or Malay realm ( Malay : ' ' Dunia Melayu ' ' or ' ' Alam Melayu ' ' , Jawi : or ) has multiple meanings depending on its context . Linguistically , it refers to the Malay-speaking countries and territories of Southeast Asia - Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , and Southern Thailand . In a geopolitical context , the term has been used interchangeably with the Javanese concept of Nusantara and the colonial term for the Malay Archipelago . It has been more broadly defined as a region , homeland of the Austronesian people that extends from the Easter Islands in the east to Madagascar in the west , . However , these wider definitions of the Malay world remained controversial and criticized for their primary derivation from the anachronistic concept of a Malay race . In a cultural sense , the Malay world refers to the homeland of ethnic Malays that was historically ruled by various Malay sultanates in Maritime Southeast Asia . This area includes the Malay peninsula , the coastal areas of Sumatra and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Origin # Portuguese historian Emanuel Godinho de Erdia 's 16th century account says the early phase of the Malay world began with the consolidation of ' ' Laut Melayu ' ' ( Malay sea ) under Melakan dominance in the 15th century . The area Erdia called the Malayos sea covers the Andaman Sea in the north , the entire Malacca Strait in the centre , a part of Sunda Strait in the south and the western South China Sea in the east . The region was generally described as a Muslim centre of international trade , with Malay language as its ' ' lingua franca ' ' . Erdia 's description indicates that ' ' Laut Melayu ' ' was a **25;60416;TOOLONG concept , a concept of geographical unity characterized by the common religious belief and cultural features . This was strongly attested when the notion of Malayness and the common Malay identity based on Islam began taking shape during the Melakan era . The subsequent expansion of Melakan commercial and religious influence beyond this cultural border had resulted in the early stage of Malayisation process , heavily marked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs . This assimilation process continued and intensified even after the demise of Melaka in the early 16th century . The post Melakan era saw the rise of numerous Melakan-modelled Malay sultanates in a larger geographical sphere of the region , ranging from the small sultanates like Asahan , Deli , Langkat and Serdang , to the powerful imperial sultanates like Brunei , Johor and Pattani . The emergence of these sultanates resulted in a broader Malay cultural and commercial influence and the eventual expansion of the Malay world . The strong Malay cultural and linguistic diffusion in the region as observed by the European scholars during colonial era , would later became the basis for the construction of several anthropological , geographical and linguistic terms . Among the examples are the concept of Malay race , the name Malay Archipelago for the region , and several linguistic terminologies such as Malayo-Polynesian languages and Malayic languages . These xenisms have been very influential in shaping various modern views on the extent of the Malay world . # See also # * Maphilindo * Nusantara

MAARC has thrived and today is an active club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon after MAARCs founding , club members began exploring the possibility of creating a museum to share their interest in vintage radio with the general public . Several possibilities were investigated but it became clear that to be successful , a separate organization dedicated to the task of creating and operating a museum has to be established . The resulting Radio &amp; Television Museum ( R&amp;T Museum ) operated by the Radio History Society , Inc. ( now the National Capital Radio &amp; Television Museum NCRTV Museum ) is a Maryland non-profit corporation established in 1993 for the express purpose of creating a museum of radio and television . R&amp;T Museum sought and received IRS 501(c) ( 3 ) nonprofit status . Starting with no building , no funds , no collection , and only a handful of dedicated volunteers , the Museum began by borrowing artifacts from local radio collectors and mounting temporary exhibits in several of the regions public libraries , downtown at the George Washington University , and at the City Place Mall in Silver Spring , Maryland . Efforts sought an affordable building in which to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century-old former farmhouse in Bowie , Maryland , that was owned and had been refurbished by the City of Bowie . The fully restored building is located at the intersection of Mitchellville and Mount Oak Roads , located just off of Route 50 and the D.C. Beltway , east of Washington , D.C. After a visit , the Museum leadership determined it might be suitable for creation of a museum . The Societys officers made a presentation to the Bowie City Council , after which the city manager agreed to a long-term lease agreement with the Society . In March 1999 a long-term lease agreement for the Radio &amp; Television Museum was signed by then-president Ed Walker and the City of Bowie . The Museum opened its doors to the public in June 1999 , and celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2009 . In recent years it became increasingly evident that the two entities Radio History Society and the Radio &amp; Television Museum were confusing . Consequently , in 2011 the board determined to change the organization name to National Capital Radio &amp; Television Museum , doing away with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name change was publicly announced on May 9 , 2012 . In addition , the board brought on its first paid professional staff in mid-2011 . This mutually beneficial public-private partnership continues today . The building and grounds continue to be maintained by the city , while NCRTV operates the museum . In other partnering , the Museum also has developed exhibits at the George Washington University ( since 2001 ) , and at the Library of American Broadcasting at the University of Maryland . Recently it is partnering with the Prince George 's County Memorial Library System to present regularly scheduled programs .

4 In molecular biology , the PsbZ ( Ycf9 ) is a protein domain , which is low in molecular weight . It is a transmembrane protein and therefore is located in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts in cyanobacteria and plants . More specifically , it is located in Photosystem II ( PSII ) and in the light-harvesting complex II ( LHCII ) . Ycf9 acts as a structural linker , that stabilises the PSII-LHCII supercomplexes . Moreover , the supercomplex fails to form in PsbZ-deficient mutants , providing further evidence to suggest Ycf9 's role as a structural linker . This may be caused by a marked decrease in two LHCII antenna proteins , CP26 and CP29 , found in PsbZ-deficient mutants , which result in structural changes , as well as functional modifications in PSII. # Function # PSII is a multisubunit protein-pigment complex containing polypeptides bound to the photosynthetic membrane . Within the core of the complex , the chlorophyll and beta-carotene pigments are mainly bound to the antenna proteins CP43 ( PsbC ) and CP47 ( PsbB ) , which pass the excitation energy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and D2 ( Qa , PsbD ) that bind all the redox-active cofactors involved in the energy conversion process . The PSII oxygen-evolving complex ( OEC ) oxidises water to provide protons for use by PSI , and consists of OEE1 ( PsbO ) , OEE2 ( PsbP ) and OEE3 ( PsbQ ) . The remaining subunits in PSII are of low molecular weight ( less than 10 kDa ) , and are involved in PSII assembly , stabilisation , dimerisation , and photo-protection . PsbZ may also be involved in photo-protective processes under sub-optimal growth conditions . # Photosynthesis # Oxygenic photosynthesis uses two multi-subunit photosystems ( I and II ) located in the cell membranes of cyanobacteria and in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in plants and algae . Photosystem II ( PSII ) has a P680 reaction centre containing chlorophyll ' a ' that uses light energy to carry out the oxidation ( splitting ) of water molecules , and to produce ATP via a proton pump . Photosystem I ( PSI ) has a P700 reaction centre containing chlorophyll that takes the electron and associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both ATP and NADPH are subsequently used in the light-independent reactions to convert carbon dioxide to glucose using the hydrogen atom extracted from water by PSII , releasing oxygen as a by-product .

A coming-of-age story , ' ' Forward Unto Dawn ' ' follows a cadet , Thomas Lasky , at a twenty-sixth century military training academy as it is attacked by the Covenant , an alliance of alien zealots . Lasky is unsure of his future within the military but feels pressured to follow in the footsteps of his mother and brother . Lasky and his surviving squad mates are rescued by the Master Chief and , after the death of his romantic interest , Chyler Silva , Lasky is inspired by the Chief to take initiative and aids him in saving the remaining cadets . ' ' Forward Unto Dawn ' ' received a Streamy Award and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing and filming of it . The series also won a Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden Reel Award for sound editing . Reviewers were impressed by the special effects and action-packed second act , but found that the plot was too slow in the first half and most of the characters were under-developed . The series was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for main title design . # Development # After the success of previous live-action promotional shorts , ' ' Landfall ' ' and ' ' The Life ' ' , 343 Industries , the studio in charge of development for the ' ' Halo ' ' franchise , wanted to use a live action series to appeal to an audience of people unfamiliar with the ' ' Halo ' ' games . The director of franchise business management at 343 Industries , Matt McClosky , explained the intended audience by saying that , You see something that looks like a video game , you 're going to get the same crowd you always get . The live-action format was also chosen for its ability to better develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Lasky to the ' ' Halo ' ' universe before his role in the video game ' ' Halo 4 ' ' . The developers wanted a protagonist with more emotion than Master Chief ( whose face is never seen ) , to not only convey an understanding of the universe , but to better engage unfamiliar viewers . Microsoft considers the series the next step between advertising material and a full length film after the failure of a previous effort , and aimed to produce a standalone series that could be enjoyed without necessarily playing the games . The budget for the series was almost USD $10 million , Microsoft 's largest investment in a live-action promotion . Director Stewart Hendler said We 're either the best-funded web series of all time , a sort of mid-road healthy TV pilot , or a super-low-budget movie . When the idea of directing a video game based web series was pitched to Hendler he declined , saying he was not interested in video game adaptions unless the subject was ' ' Halo ' ' . Hendler was already a fan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games . Potential writers were interviewed by 343 Industries , and some were selected to write a draft of a script . Aaron and Todd Helbing wrote a pitch set on Harvest , the first planet to be attacked by the Covenant ( see ' ' Halo : Contact Harvest ' ' ) . Although 343 Industries decided not to use it , the Helbing brothers ' script was the most complete and demonstrated the best understanding of the ' ' Halo ' ' universe so they were chosen to write ' ' Forward Unto Dawn ' ' . The final plot was developed by 343 Industries , Frank O'Connor , and the Helbings with the intention of introducing a new character to tie-in to ' ' Halo 4 ' ' , which their Harvest script did not , and to explore the least-well-known part of the ' ' Halo ' ' universe . In addition to providing input on the script , 343 Industries had a representative on set at all times to ensure that the series did not break canon . # Shooting and special effects # The series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forests around Vancouver , at Simon Fraser University and at additional stages in Burnaby . The Herzog and Company production team was in Vancouver for three months with set design by Legacy Effects , the same company that worked on the previous shorts . The Warthog ( a 4WD off-road vehicle with a mounted minigun ) that appears in ' ' Forward Unto Dawn ' ' is the same one that was produced by Weta Workshop and used in ' ' Landfall ' ' . Stunt driver Johnathon Kralt found that the prop handles the roads extremely well for something that size and that height , and the four-wheel steering was an advantage for drifting . Many chase shots were made using a Mercedes-Benz ML 55 pursuit vehicle with a camera boom mounted to the roof . Another rig involved towing the Warthog on a low trailer so that cameras could focus on an actor while the vehicle was being driven . The visual effects supervisor , John Sullivan , hired Arc Productions to create just under 500 shots with computer generated imagery , between a quarter and a third of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear are all completely computer generated , as is the academy 's space elevator , weapons ' muzzle flashes and a few shots of Master Chief . Hendler felt that the visual effects were the area that needed particular focus and spent a much larger percentage of the budget on the Master Chief costume and computer generated imagery than is normal for a production . One scene involves a Covenant Elite stalking the cadets in the armoury . The geometry of the Elite already exists for the ' ' Halo ' ' video games and was used to accelerate the creation of a 3D model in Mental Ray . The outdoor attack on the academy was filmed at Simon Fraser University and required photogrammetric reconstruction and laser measurement to add the aliens and weapons lighting effects in a convincing manner . A later scene in the forest was too complex to use the same techniques , lacking the geometric shapes of the university campus . Instead , Arc visual effects supervisor Terry Bradley scattered LEDs on the set . By measuring the distance between LEDs the studio could model the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add the weapons fire . The shattering of the pink needles fired by the Covenant was rendered in Houdini as the shots hit concrete and Master Chief 's armour . The opening sequences of each episode show Cortana , an artificial intelligence , aboard the spaceship ' ' Forward Unto Dawn ' ' as she malfunctions . The five sequences were entirely computer generated by Polynoid , the animation team of Blacklist , a production company . # Setting # ' ' Forward Unto Dawn ' ' takes place on a fictional planet , Cirnicus-IV , one of many that humans have colonized outside of the solar system . The protagonist , Thomas Lasky , is aboard a spaceship named ' ' Infinity ' ' in 2557 . ' ' Forward Unto Dawn ' ' portrays his memory of the events on Circninus-IV in 2526 , when he is a cadet at the Corbulo Academy , a training facility for the children of high-ranking UNSC officers . The UNSC is training the cadets for war with insurrectionists on various colony planets . A Covenant army attacks the academy causing confusion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unto Dawn ' ' , the Covenant are a theocratic collection of alien species that are religiously offended by Humanity and seek to eradicate it . The events portrayed in ' ' Forward Unto Dawn ' ' are some of the earliest encounters with the Covenant , and the characters other than Master Chief were unaware of their existence . # Casting and characters # The production team was responsible for casting , but Microsoft maintained a final say . The decision to use Alex Puccinelli instead of Steve Downes , the previous voice artist of Master Chief , was approved by Microsoft . The actors playing the cadets attended a boot camp before shooting to raise their fitness and accustom them to assault courses and rifle drills in their armour costumes . Cast members drove themselves to overexertion in the training , causing some to vomit , which they saw as a bonding experience . Tom Green plays the protagonist Thomas Lasky , a cadet at Corbulo Academy and Ty Olsson plays the adult rendition . Lasky is ambivalent about his role in the military , considering diplomacy a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his mother is a colonel and his brother Cadmon ( played by Max Carver ) was an ODST ( Orbital Drop Shock Troopers - a special forces unit in the ' ' Halo ' ' universe ) , but Thomas is uninterested in becoming an officer . Green portrayed Lasky as a regular teenager , unsure of his future . As research for the role , Green was required to watch the previous shorts and read the ' ' Halo ' ' encyclopedia that 343 Industries uses to preserve the ' ' Halo ' ' canon . Executive producer Josh Feldman considers Lasky an important character in the ' ' Halo ' ' universe beyond just ' ' Forward Unto Dawn ' ' and ' ' Halo 4 ' ' . Daniel Cudmore was cast to play the role of Master Chief largely due to his height and physique . The director , Stewart Hendler , wanted to contrast the size of Master Chief to that of the teenage cadets ; Cudmore is 203 centimetres ( 6 ' 8 ) tall whereas the actors playing the cadets were deliberately chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately portray Master Chief , Cudmore watched the ' ' Landfall ' ' shorts by Neill Blomkamp and read the ' ' Halo ' ' novels for the history of the character , having already played the games . Cudmore expressed interest in the history of Master Chief , the character 's view on war and his role as a soldier , as he was only required to portray a utilitarian character in the series . Cudmore thinks the character is torn between aiding the cadets and completing his mission , but Master Chief 's confidence and actions inspire the cadets . Legacy Effects took a body scan of Cudmore , then overlaid a 3D model provided by Microsoft and edited it to get proportions correct . A prototype was 3D printed and then used to make moulds for the final suit . The majority of the suit is rubber over a foam bodysuit , similar to a wetsuit , with a fibreglass helmet . Cudmore compared wearing it to walking through water , although he had to perform stunts in the suit as it was made only for his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they were shot to ensure that they were deliberate but without appearing robotic , trying to make his movements a little larger than life , but still with a sense of humanity to them . Both Hendler and Frank O'Connor praised Cudmore , not just for his physique but for moving in a fluid manner in the cumbersome suit . Anna Popplewell plays Chyler Silva , a cadet who , contrary to Lasky 's beliefs , is a full supporter of the war against the insurrectionists . Popplewell portrays Silva as a competent cadet who has been hardened by her childhood surrounded by insurrectionist violence . She had a romantic connection with Lasky that was interrupted by the Covenant attack . Popplewell was new to the ' ' Halo ' ' series when cast for the role but thinks that the characters and aesthetic of the series have the potential to draw in a new audience .

The model is approximately one metre ( 3 ' ) long and has scenes from both the video game and the web series . # Critical reaction # Reviewers were divided on what standard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the budget was beyond that of other web series but not on par with a film . IGN reviewer Jesse Schedeen considered the cadets other than Lasky and Silva to be ready-made cannon fodder , having received minimal development . This detracted from the quality of the third episode , as a betrayal by cadet Tchakova had little impact due to her shallow development . However , Schedeen did appreciate Green 's acting in the last episode , noting that Silva 's death scene was handled very well , particularly as it forced Tom Green to shed his calm exterior and react much more emotionally . In his later review of the Blu-ray , Schedeen complimented the audio and video quality , as well as the inclusion of many vignettes , documentary featurettes and commentaries . James Plath of ' ' Movie Metropolis ' ' also found the characters lacking in the first half , but noted that in the second half , the characters of Lasky and Silva actually move beyond the clichs and pick up a personality along the way . Plath was impressed by the soundtrack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complimented the special effects saying the CGI work is enhanced by high definition , not exposed by it . Overall however , he thought that despite the action being exciting , the pedestrian first-half and only adequate acting would prevent ' ' Forward Unto Dawn ' ' appealing to an audience beyond existing gamers . ' ' Official Xbox Magazine ' ' s reviewer , Edwin Evans , appreciated the direction of the series ; Stewart Hendler 's well-judged editing keeps the script from sinking under the weight of its own melodrama , and his close-ups never overstay their welcome , hiding the weaknesses of the inexperienced ( but talented ) cast . He also echoed Plath 's thoughts on the slow first-half and exciting second half . # Awards and nominations #

4 gridref = NW4111830995 Divis transmitting station is the main high-power UHF and BBC National FM/DAB station that serves County Antrim and parts of County Down . Situated just outside Belfast , it is the primary UHF/FM main station in Northern Ireland and was originally Northern Ireland 's main BBC 405-line television transmitter , coming into operation in this capacity on 21 July 1955 . As such , it was the first permanent television transmitter to be established within the island of Ireland . Although one of three UHF main stations in Northern Ireland , it is the only one to feature a stayed mast , the other stations at Brougher Mountain and Limavady both utilising smaller self-supporting towers . Stayed masts are however located at the UHF relay stations at Londonderry and Strabane ( respectively former BBC and ITA 405-line relays ) and at Black Mountain , the former ITA 405-line main station and current transmitter of Channel 5 that is sited adjacent to Divis . It is owned and operated by Arqiva . The Divis station is located in a range of hills directly overlooking Belfast from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was controlled by the Ministry of Defence , until it was sold in 2004 to the National Trust and subsequently opened to the public . It is sited between the peaks of Divis Mountain and Black Mountain and is ironically closer to the latter than the transmitter that is named after it . # Television history # Divis was opened by the BBC on 21 July 1955 as their permanent 405-line Band I transmission facility serving Northern Ireland . It superseded the temporary station at Glencairn , which was one of two transmitters ( the other being Pontop Pike ) to be rushed into operation on 1 May 1953 , in time for the televised Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II . Although the BBC had by this time already obtained the Divis site , the need to construct the long access road was the primary factor preventing its immediate use for a provisional installation . Divis was designated as a medium-power transmitter , on which type of installation the second phase of BBC Band I stations were based . In this respect , Divis was grouped with permanent installations at Meldrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandale and Tacolneston . Transmissions from Divis were on VHF Channel 1 at a peak output of 35 kW vision e.r.p . In due course , a number of relay stations were established across Northern Ireland to enhance coverage from Divis , most notably at Brougher Mountain in County Fermanagh , the latter being the site of a future UHF main station . In the meantime , the Independent Television Authority ( ITA ) built their equivalent 405-line VHF Band III station close to Divis . Located at Black Mountain quarry , less than two miles to the south-west , this came into operation on 31 October 1959 and utilised a taller 750-ft mast . Divis however became the UHF main station for Belfast and surrounding area with BBC2 the first regular service commencing 18 March 1967 . Colour UHF transmitters for BBC1 and ITV came into operation in September 1970 . Both this site and Black Mountain are perhaps not surprisingly ( bearing in mind the area history ) dual ring-fenced for enhanced security . It has since been made public that the current transmitter mast ( 152.5 m ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new guyed steel mast ( 192.7 m ) . This meant for a period of time there were two broadcast masts at the site in preparation for the digital switchover in the Ulster region which occurred in October 2012 . Whilst this was certainly one of the plans , in reality a new 152m guyed mast has been constructed , and the original mast remains to carry the VHF and DAB services . By way of its extensive transmitter bases , Divis contributes significantly to the telecommunications network for much of Northern Ireland . # Services available # # Digital television # Digital television services broadcast on the following frequencies , and with the following powers : # #Before switchover# # # Analogue television # Analogue television services were broadcast on the following frequencies : All of the above channels , except TG4 , were broadcast at a power of 500 kW .

4 Lady Carla ( foaled 8 March 1993 ) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare best known for winning the Epsom Oaks in 1996 . In a racing career which lasted from October 1995 to July 1997 the filly ran six times and won three races . After winning her only race as a two-year-old , Lady Carly won the Listed Oaks Trial Stakes at Lingfield Park on her three-year-old debut . Four weeks later she maintained her unbeaten run in the Classic Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom , winning by nine lengths . She was beaten when favourite for the Irish Oaks and finished unplaced in two races the following season before being retired to stud. # Background # Lady Carla was a bay mare with a white star , bred by the Meon Valley Stud in Hampshire , England .

As a yearling , Lady Carla was sent to the Tattersalls September sales at Newmarket , where she was bought for 220,000 guineas by Wafic Said 's Addison Racing Ltd . Lady Carla was sent into training with Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stables at Newmarket . She was ridden to all her wins by the veteran Irish jockey Pat Eddery. # Racing career # Lady Carla did not appear on a racecourse in 1995 until late October , when she was sent to contest a 4,000 maiden race at Leicester Racecourse . She started the 5/2 second favourite in a field of twelve runners and won by four lengths from the colt General Macarthur .

The field for the 1996 Epsom Oaks was not a strong one , with the Rockfel Stakes winner Bint Salsabil being the only one of the eleven fillies to have won at Group race level . The best filly of the season , Bosra Sham ( also owned by Said and trained by Cecil ) , was rested during the summer after winning the 1000 Guineas . Lady Carla was made 100/30 second favourite behind Pricket , the representative of Sheikh Mohammed 's Godolphin organisation .

The winning distance was the fourth longest of the century , after those of Sun Princess ( twelve lengths in 1983 ) , Noblesse ( ten lengths in 1963 ) and Jet Ski Lady ( ten lengths in 1991 ) . Only five fillies appeared to oppose Lady Carla in the Irish Oaks at the Curragh in July , and she started at odds of 1/2 to maintain her unbeaten record . The build-up to the race was marked by controversy , with Cecil angrily denying claims from the television pundit John McCririck that the filly had developed a serious respiratory condition . In the race , Eddery attempted to lead from the start , but when Lady Carla was challenged in the straight she failed to respond and was soon beaten . She finished fourth behind the Dermot Weld-trained Dance Design , beaten by four and a half lengths .

4 Yarim-Lim I , also given as Yarimlim , ( reigned ) was the second king of the ancient Amorite kingdom of Yamhad in modern-day Aleppo , Syria . # Reign # # Early Reign and Conflicts # Yarim-Lim was the son and successor of the first king Sumu-Epuh and his queen Sumunna-Abi . The kingdom of Yamhad was being threatened by the Assyrian king Shamshi-Adad I who had surrounded Yamhad through his alliance with Charchemish and Urshu to the north , Qatna to the south , and conquering Mari to the east . Yarim-Lim ascended the throne after his father was killed in 1780 during his campaigns against Shamshi-Adad . He was able to stand up to Shamshi-Adad by surrounding him with deft alliances with Hammurabi of Babylon and Ibal-pi-el II of Eshnunna . His alliance with Hammurabi was credited with saving Babylon from an Assyrian attack by attacking their rear . In 1777 Yarim-Lim conquered the city of Tuttul , on the confluence of the rivers Balikh and Euphrates . He appointed his ally , Zimri-Lim , the heir to the throne of Mari who was living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shamshi-Adad died in 1776 , he helped Zimrilim regain his throne in Mari and oust Yasmah-Adad . The alliance between Mari and Yamhad was cemented with the royal marriage between Zimrilim and Yarim-Lim 's daughter Shibtu , two days after the marriage ceremony queen Sumunna-Abi died . Ibal-pi-el II of Eshnuna exploited Shamshi-Adad death to pursuit an expansionist policy , advancing on the account of Assyria and causing stress to the alliance , he later allied himself with Elam the enemy of Hammurabi who was Yarim-Lim ally . # #Relations with Mari# # Zimri-Lim ascension to the throne with the help of Yarim-Lim I effected Mari status , Zimri-Lim referred to Yarim-Lim as his father and acted under the guidance of Aleppo main deity Hadad of which Yarim-Lim was the mediator . The tablets of Mari recorded many events that revealed Zimri-Lim subordination . On two occasions Zimri-Lim demanded the extradition of his subordinates from Yarim-Lim I , the first case was related to a vassal king of Zimri-Lim who addressed him as a brother instead of a father and the demand was refused , while the second was through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fugitives to which Yarim-Lim answered with decline twice before agreeing on the Mariote ambassador third attempt .

The relationship between Qatna and Yamhad seems to have improved during Yarim-Lim 's reign as well . The armies of Aleppo campaigned as far as Elam near the modern southern Iraqi-Iranian boarders , a tablet discovered at mari revealed the extent of those military interventions in Mesopotamia , the tablet includes a declaration of war against Dr and Diniktum in retaliation for their Evil deeds , a reminder to the king of Dr about the military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stationing of 500 Aleppan warships for twelve years in Diniktum . By the time of his death , Yarim-Lim , had more than twenty kings as vassals and allies . According to Historian William J.

4 In mathematics , the Demazure conjecture is a conjecture about representations of algebraic groups over the integers made by . The conjecture implies that many of the results of his paper can be extended from complex algebraic groups to algebraic groups over fields of other characteristics or over the integers . year=1979 journal=American Mathematical Society . Bulletin . New Series issn=0002-9904 volume=1 issue=2 pages=432435 showed that Demazure 's conjecture ( for classical groups ) follows from their work on standard monomial theory , and Peter Littelmann extended this to all reductive algebraic groups . 
514 Dinosporin is a macromolecular , highly resistant organic compound which forms or partly forms , the enclosing wall of fossilizable organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts. # Composition # The walls of organic-walled dinocysts are composed of the resistant biopolymer called dinosporin . This organic compound has similarities to sporopollenin , but is unique to dinoflagellates . Resistant biopolymers are non-hydrolyzable and fossilizable macromolecular organic compounds present in many microalgal cell walls and fossil palynomorphs . Thus far , only the motile stage of ' ' Gymnodinium catenatum ' ' has been shown to produce the highly aliphatic biopolymer algaenan . Dinosporin has been shown to be a significantly different biopolymer from algaenan , which demonstrates that dinoflagellates are able to produce a completely different biomacromolecule for their resting cysts . Previous descriptions of dinosporin having similar properties to sporopollenin were based on both compounds resistance to hydrolysis and high preservation potential . However , further research has instead shown that dinosporin is compositionally distinct . Despite the clear distinction between dinosporin and other resistant biopolymer groups , very little is known about the actual structure of dinosporin . A recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Lingulodinium polyedrum ' ' does not contain significant amounts of long chain aliphatics , nor is it primarily aromatic , but that it is a highly crosslinked carbohydrate-based polymer . Furthermore , dinosporin may be taxon specific as species within the same genus exhibited different compositions , so that dinosporin may be more accurately thought of as a suite of related but chemically distinguishable biopolymers . Studies of dinosporin composition and structure are complicated by the fact that the cysts have to either have the cell contents effectively removed ( cysts generated in culture ) or be individually picked ( cysts from sediments ) in order to ensure sample purity . The culture-derived cysts risk condensation of the cell content and modification of the cyst wall while the cysts picked from sediment are time consuming to acquire and may have been altered by post-mortem processes . For example , the macromolecular composition of the fossil dinoflagellate cyst ' ' Thalassiphora pelagica ' ' was analyzed , but post-mortem alteration was noted . Furthermore , dinocysts can be subject to selective preservation . This has been speculated to reflect different dinosporin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no conclusive differences have been shown . Recent FTIR work shows both differences and similarities between the major dinocyst lineages , which are suggested to be related to nutritional strategies .

7514 ' ' Feeling Sexy ' ' is a 1999 Australian short feature from artist Davida Allen . Allen later described the film as : # A lovely plum pudding story . It 's not out there with a big sign saying that this is the answer . But like all stories you can just get a little taste of ' we could do that ' . There 's hope and , as a Catholic , I feel that there is hope and I want to tell stories that say there is hope . It 's a love story unlike the Hollywood stories which say move on ; it 's not working here so move on . ' ' Feeling Sexy ' ' is not a kind of Bible story that says , ' Drat it , this is going to be hard work ' . It 's just a different angle at looking at a universal situation . It 's a celebration of monogamy . It 's very similar to a seed which , unless it 's watered , dies . #

514 Stage 10 of the Cambrian is the still unnamed third and final stage of the Furongian Series . It follows the Jiangshanian and precedes the Ordovician Tremadocian Stage . The proposed lower boundary is the first appearance of the trilobite ' ' Lotagnostus americanus ' ' around million years ago , but other fossils are also being discussed ( see below ) . The upper boundary is defined as the appearance of the conodont ' ' Iapetognathus fluctivagus ' ' which marks the beginning of the Tremadocian and is radiometrically dated as million years ago . # Naming # The 10th stage of the Cambrian has not been formally named by the ICS yet , although a number of local names exist . Several authors favor the name Lawsonian after Lawson Cove , in the Wah Wah Mountains of Utah . # Stratotype # The ICS is still discussing which geological section and biostratigraphic marker will be used to define the base of the 10th Cambrian stage . Likely candidates for the section are still investigated . A first proposal was a section near Duibian , Zhejiang province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House Range of Utah . If a conodont is used for the base the stage then many more sections would be likely candidates for the GSSP , e.g. in Australia , Kazakhstan and Canada . Candidates for the biostratigraphic marker are the first appearance of a trilobite or conodont species . The trilobite ' ' Lotagnostus americanus ' ' was first suggested by the ICS , but has proven to be problematic . In 2006 another working group proposed the first appearance of ' ' Cordylodus andresi ' ' . Currently the first appearance of ' ' Eoconodontus notchpeakensis ' ' is favored by many authors because it is globally widespread and is independent of facies ( known from continental rise to peritidal environments ) . The ' ' Eoconodontus notchpeakensis ' ' proposal would also incorporate a non-biostratigraphic marker to correlate the beginning of Stage 10 globally . A carbon isotope excursion ( the HERB-event ) occurs in the lower part of the ' ' E. notchpeakensis ' ' range . # Subdivisions # Cambrian Stage 10 can be subdivided using different biostratigraphic zones .

He has also worked for promotions such as Combat Zone Wrestling ( CZW ) , Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South ( IWA-MS ) , National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) , Pro Wrestling Guerrilla ( PWG ) and Resistance Pro Wrestling ( RPW ) . In May 2013 , he signed a developmental contract with WWE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodriguez was born in Chicago , Illinois , United States , but spent his first years living in Mexico City , Mexico . In the mid-90s , when he was still in primary school , Rodriguez 's family moved to Chicago , though they also kept making regular trips to Mexico City . In Chicago , he attended Curie Metropolitan High School . Rodriguez grew up a fan of Mexican professional wrestling , or ' ' lucha libre ' ' , especially workers like Tinieblas , whose mask and physique caught his attention , and Octagn , whose in-ring style caught his attention . As a child , Rodriguez bought both Tinieblas ' and Octagn 's replica masks . After moving to the United States , Rodriguez started watching World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) , World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) and Extreme Championship Wrestling ( ECW ) , taking influence from the likes of Rey Mysterio , Rob Van Dam and Sabu . In high school , Rodriguez started watching independent promotions like Ring of Honor ( ROH ) as well as Japanese promotions .

Rodriguez has later noted that because of his youth , his trainers were strict on him , leading him to contemplating quitting the school . Rodriguez made his debut for WCPW after only three weeks of training . Combining his Mexican and Japanese influences , he adopted the ring name Samuray del Sol , choosing to use the spelling Samuray in order to differentiate himself from several other workers using the name Samurai . Much like his childhood idols , Rodriguez also began wrestling under a mask .

During this time , the Budjak was under control of the Turks . The Turks traditionally accepted refugees in their lands , and patronized the population of these lands . The area was originally called Zhebriyany . After the annexation of Bessarabia and Budjak to the Russian Empire , Zhebriyany became a border village , and after the dissolution of the Zaporizhian Sich , many Cossacks moved to the Danube Delta , creating Danube Sich , and from there they absorbed the village . In 1905 the village 's first Lipovan church was founded , becoming a local attraction .

The Romanian troops eventually retreated , and the Soviet troops retook control of the village . After the war , the village , like many other seaside towns in Ukraine , the village changed its name to Prymorskoe , which translates to Seaside .

4 ' ' Free Dimensional ' ' , released on October 23 , 2012 , is the second album from Canadian musician Diamond Rings ( real name : John O'Regan ) . According to O'Regan , his Diamond Rings persona exists to sort of smash that kind of tendency that I think we all have to sort of hide behind ourselves . And I think this record 's probably , or definitely , my strongest statement that I 've made to date . He also says a big part of this album was becoming more comfortable as a musician and a composer and an arranger , and I felt like I really stepped up as a singer with this album , and Im really proud of that . O'Regan has stated that this album is more polished than ' ' Special Affections ' ' , but I did nt really change my approach lyrically or emotionally . I feel like theyre still conveying the same message , but just coated in a way that has a few more layers of gloss . Its like we spent a two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier dance orientation to his unique recording set-up : I had a sit-down desk and I got rid of it cause I started working all day on these songs and I started feeling really sluggish , like I was a banker or something . So I got rid of the desk , put my computer up , and started recording like that . And it just all has a more dance-ready feel because I was dancing when I was making it ! O'Regan has compared ' ' Special Affections ' ' to ' ' Free Dimensional ' ' : The old album is more introspective , whereas Free Dimensional seems outrospective . It 's got all this energy coming out of it . # Track listing #

According to Nielsen Media Research , the episodes were watched by 4.88 million viewers during their original broadcast , becoming ' ' 30 Rock ' ' <nowiki> ' </nowiki> s highest-rated episodes for two years . It was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards : Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series , Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series , Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series , and Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for Rural Juror , ultimately winning one for Fey and Wigfield 's writing . It has been listed as one of the greatest series finales in television history by numerous publications . # Plot # Liz Lemon ( Tina Fey ) returns for the final episode of ' ' TGS ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Tracy Morgan ) , who she expects will do anything in his power to stop production going ahead , so that he will get his $30 million payout from the network , and Lutz ( John Lutz ) , whose turn it is alphabetically to pick the last lunch the ' ' TGS ' ' writers will share together . Meanwhile , Jack Donaghy ( Alec Baldwin ) is preparing to leave and regrets the way things ended with Liz , but his attempts to make it up to her are rejected . Tearfully , he appeals to Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) for advice on how to repair the pair 's broken friendship , but she warns him that she has never known Liz to let a grudge go . Finally , network president Kenneth Parcell ( Jack McBrayer ) wants Jenna to pick an emotional musical number that she can perform at the close of the final show . Both Liz 's problems escalate as Tracy bribes Al Roker to run a news report that a snowicane is headed for the city , and Lutz decides to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other writers . Meanwhile , Jack begins to act more and more strangely , giving away his personal possessions and walking around the ' ' TGS ' ' studio declaring his love and appreciation for everyone . Pete ( Scott Adsit ) theorises that he could be planning to commit suicide , before suggesting that a real man would opt instead to fake his own death , an idea he becomes suspiciously enamored with . Liz initially dismisses this , but grows concerned when Jack suggests he 'll be at the final show in spirit . Elsewhere , Jenna decides that , following her unsuccessful attempts to make it in dramatic television and movies , she will return to her first love , Broadway , and picks the song from her upcoming musical ' ' The Rural Juror ' ' as her final performance for ' ' TGS ' ' . However , upon hearing it , Kenneth is concerned that Jenna 's performance lacks real emotion , and that she does not genuinely care that the show is ending . In the writers ' room , Lutz remains five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choose another lunch picker , proclaiming that ordering Blimpie is his revenge on them for having constantly picked on him , unprovoked , for the last seven years . Liz overcomes him and locks him in her office , but he escapes through the ceiling panels and lands right on top of their new lunch choice , finally getting his triumphant victory as they concede to order from Blimpie . Kenneth returns to Jenna 's dressing room with two removal men in tow and informs her that he needs to take her mirror , because Brian Williams wants it for his bathroom . Suddenly , she breaks down in tears as she realises that ' ' TGS ' ' is over for good , and that she will miss something after all , if only her mirror . As the final broadcast approaches , Tracy disappears and Grizz ( Grizz Chapman ) and Dot Com ( Kevin Brown ) reveal that he is hiding out at Dark Sensations , the strip club to which he had taken Liz when they 'd first met . She confronts him and he explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , but because he has feared saying goodbye to people ever since he was young , and his father went out for cigarettes and never returned . Liz confesses that it is possible that they wo n't remain friends after ' ' TGS ' ' , because people naturally drift apart , but that she loves him despite everything he has put her through . Tracy appreciates her honesty and agrees to return . At the final recording , Jenna tells Tracy that she will miss him , and the pair embrace . However , Jack is suspiciously absent , and another conversation with Pete about faking his own death leads Liz to believe that Jack is indeed planning to commit suicide . Her fears are confirmed when she discovers a video suicide note in his office , and she tracks his phone to the waterfront , where he is preparing to leave on a boat . He explains that he plans to go away to find what makes him happy , and that he only led her to believe he wanted to kill himself because he was afraid that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold her grudge . He goes on to confess that over the last seven years , she was one thing that consistently made him happy , and the pair acknowledge that they love each other as friends . Jack makes off on his boat , but turns around almost immediately and declares that he 's found the answer ; the best idea he 's ever had : dishwashers you can see into . At ' ' TGS ' ' , Tracy thanks the audience for tuning in for the past seven years , as Jenna emotionally performs her final song . # Epilogue # One year later , Pete has faked his own death and started a new life , but is found by his wife ; Liz is producing Grizz 's new sitcom ' ' Grizz &amp; Herz ' ' , and has taken her children to work ; she has also stayed in touch with Tracy , whose father has finally returned from getting cigarettes ; Jenna is attempting to steal a Tony Award from Alice Ripley ; Jack 's creation of the see-through dishwasher has led him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is still friends with Liz . In homage to the ' ' St. Elsewhere ' ' finale , an immortal Kenneth holds a snow globe containing the Rockefeller Center , as he hears Liz 's great-granddaughter 's pitch for a show based on the stories Liz had told her about working at ' ' TGS ' ' . # Reception # The hour-long broadcast of Hogcock ! and Last Lunch was watched by 4.88 million viewers and earned a 1.9 rating/5 share in the 1849 demographic . This means that it was seen by 1.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . This represented a season high in total viewers and in the demographic , an increase of two million viewers over the previous season finale and the highest-rated episode of the series , in overall viewers , for two years . When data obtained from DVR viewers who watched the episode within seven days of broadcast was factored in , total viewership for the finale increased by 25 percent , to 6.13 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent , to a 2.6 rating . The series finale received acclaim from critics and from fans of the series . Alan Sepinwall of ' ' HitFix ' ' opined that the finale gave these ridiculous cartoon characters three dimensions for at least a few moments so they could say proper goodbyes to each other , and to us . He elaborated that Liz and Tracy back at the strip club was a blunt but heartfelt summation of their whole relationship , and Jack on the boat giving a long preamble about the true nature of their friendship before saying that he loved Liz ( which Liz spared him from actually having to do by saying it to him first ) was a thing of beauty . In conclusion , he wrote that he would miss this show , but this ending felt close to perfect . Roth Cornet of ' ' IGN ' ' gave the episode a masterpiece 10 out of 10 and commented ' ' 30 Rock ' ' had the rare ability to provide both comedy and earned sentiment . That has never been more true than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to his roots , his true-love , after a gloriously short-lived soul searching sea adventure : housewares . Liz , once and for all , embraces the fact that , yes , you can have it all , but having it all ultimately means truly knowing and accepting yourself , and having the willingness to compromise . And with that , a series that could have been an ingenious bit of comedy , but not much more , became a show about people and relationships that will stay with us well past the final fade to black tonight . Pilot Viruet of ' ' The A.V. Club ' ' awarded the episode an A and singled out two scenes in particular as perfect : The first is Liz meeting Tracy at the strip club they visited in the pilot and , while admitting that its possible they wont be friends after this , admitting she still does sincerely love him . The second scene is , if sic course , Jacks suicide fakeout , which he staged as a way to prove that Liz Lemon would miss him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be seen in plenty of future sitcoms ... and while its a shame to see it go , its great to see it go out on such a high note . Amy Amatangelo of ' ' Paste ' ' scored the episode a 9.3 out of 10 and opined that Its hard to create a series finale that will make every fan happy . But ' ' 30 Rock ' ' , which is going out still very close to the top of its game , came very close . There was so much to love about the episode : Lizs frighteningly spot-on fights with the moms at Gothammoms.com . Jenna landing in LA , seeing the competition , and high-tailing it right back to New York . The show getting in a few last digs at NBC . Plenty of Grizz and Dot Com . What appeared to be the shows real crew in the final ' ' TGS ' ' shot . The return of Jonathan . Tracy spelling out his name for Kenneths receptionist ( R as in the pirate noise , A as in the Fonzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant look in the mirror to confirm that shes crying . Sure , I could have done without the Lutz demand for Blimpies as the last lunch , but I quibble . James Poniewozik of ' ' Time ' ' commented that In some ways , last weeks episode felt more like a finale , in that it put a period on several stories : Liz got her kids , ' ' TGS ' ' hit the end of its run , Jack got Kabletown and Kenneth became president of NBC . The last hour , on the other hand , was a goodbyein a ' ' 30 Rock ' ' -ian meta sense , it was like the one more episode that ' ' TGS ' ' itself had to make , because we werent quite ready to stop and added And Im glad we got that epilogue , because as neatly as the rest of this shortened final season wrapped up ' ' 30 Rocks ' ' plotlines , this last hour captured its emotion . Tom Gliatto of ' ' People ' ' praised the episode as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added that the characters were full of the sparkling , absurd liveliness that characterized the show at its best throughout seven seasons . He concluded that With its endless supply of shiny , shapely little jokes , the show could feel like a wonderful salad served up without a bowl . You got tired of being showered with lovely microgreens . This time we got the bowl . It was a lovely burnished wood . Brian Lowry of ' ' Variety ' ' was slightly less favourable , commenting The finale earns points for ambition and nostalgia . There are the obligatory celebrity cameos , some very clever lines , a nifty callback to the pilot , and a kicker that exhibits a real love for television a lot of the audience probably wo n't understand it . But the whole thing is a little too precious and yes , weird - frittering away too much time on the supporting players ... before getting to the really good stuff . 
4 Cyrille-Edouard Cottin ( 1870-1942 ) was a French industrialist and racing driver , co-founder of the Automobiles Cottin et Desgouttes company . # Life # Cyrille-Edouard Cottin was the 4th of the 7 children of Cyrille Cottin who had married Louise Payen in 1863 , hailing from a large family of the Lyon bourgeoisie , the descendants of which have had numerous alliances with French nobility . His father held his fortune from the family silk business created in 1830 and of which he was an associate : Les petits fils de Claude-Joseph Bonnet . Due to the large number of descendants of the latter , the custom was that only the elder sons of each branch could enter the business . Thus , Cyrille-Edouard Cottin , who could not enter , created his own business and teamed with Pierre Desgoutte in 1906 , when he was 36 years old . He invested his fortune , helped by his wife 's dowry ( born Adda Bourras ) , and the trust which he got from his friends , relationships and family in the Lyons middle-class . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a definite charisma . All of this together with the high technical competence of Pierre Desgoutte , allowed the new company Cottin&amp; Desgoutte sto develop rapidly . Cyrille Cottin was also first-class racing driver , racing both in France and abroad in North Africa , Zurich and Australia where whe won the 400-mile Race . After World War I , he returned to competition , winning regularly on his famous ' ' M Type ' ' . When the company encoutered its first difficulties in 1929 , Andr Citron , who was already mass-producing automobiles , proposed to acquire the company . Through pride , Cottin refused and eventually lost most of his fortune . # References # **14;19646;references 
4 ' ' Czarface ' ' is a collaborative studio album by American rapper Inspectah Deck and underground hip hop duo 7L &amp; Esoteric . The album was released on February 19 , 2013 . The album features guest appearances from Roc Marciano , Oh No , Ghostface Killah , Action Bronson , Cappadonna and Vinnie Paz . The albums production comes from 7L , Spada4 and DJ Premier . # Background # In February 2013 , during an interview with HipHopDX , Inspectah Deck spoke about the origins of the album , saying : I really do nt think there were a lot of goals or things like that . For me right now , its taking off better than anticipated because I guess I underestimated the peoples need to hear something worth listening to . So I did ' ' CZARFACE ' ' , Ive done a couple records with 7L &amp; Esoteric back in the day with Speaking Real Words and another 12th Chamber . Ive done two songs with them already , and we built up a lot of buzz just off of those two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tour with the Wu-Tang Clan , but we all talked about it a while agoabout doing this type of project . It all just came together at the right time , and the whole ' ' CZARFACE ' ' thing was supposed to be a hero to save Hip Hop . I did nt really have the whole cartoon , comic book vision all in my head at that time . I sat down with Esoteric , he brought that thought to light and I thought that would be a good idea . A lot of the real Hip Hop heads , the true school Hip Hop generation , they know what that covers all about . We grew up with those comic books , some of us are still die-hard fans of that , and I thought bringing that together with just being the classic Hip Hop beats and rhymes of the ' 90s and before . I thought that combination was going to bring something to the game . I think ' ' CZARFACE ' ' is the blue-collar album of Rap right now . I think its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben Wallace and them . They really had no star but the whole team was blue-collar , and everybody gave that effort . I think this is one of those underdog albums that , when the smoke clears from all of those big guns going off , youre still going to hear these shots going . I listened to the project really head-to-toe for the first time the other day and Im like , It sounds good man . Just let it play from beginning to end , thats how we used to do when we had cassette tapes ; just let it roll then go to the other side . I think this is one of those personally , just listening to the sound I think . We leaked three songsthe one with Roc Marciano Cement 3 's , the one with Action Bronson Its Raw and the one Shoguns with Vinnie Paz . I believe that created a real buzz for it right now , so its getting good feedback and a good vibe . I think this is one of the smart choices for 2013 . Esoteric also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Basically it started out as 7Ls idea to put out something like a white label or kind of a diamond in the rough slab of vinyl that really had no promotion at all and was just kind of leaked out there . You know we still have that ' 90s mentality . With me and Inspectah Deck on the mic and 7L on production , we were just going to have it sneak out . As we started recording , we thought we could actually sell this , so we started to conceptualize the idea of ' ' CZARFACE ' ' and having that be the name of the group . The character represents the three of us when were on the mic and doing damage or whatever . The idea was to make a few records , keep it really lyrical and give the people what they wanted and expect from the Wu-Tang Clans most heralded swordsman so to speak , and me and 7L from Boston . So it was just doing what we do in the past but just come out swinging in 2013 . # Esoteric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : # It was just important for us to work with lyricists that we respect and just keep it a really organic record . Were not trying to dial in an Akon hook or something like that thats going to make a record blow up in a way that does nt really suit us . I think the natural thing to do is to get some Wu members , some members from my crewweve got Vinnie Paz on the record . Everyone was really excited and easy to work with because they saw our vision . Obviously the Wu guys with an allegiance to Deck just made it a real easy thing . And 7L wanted to get Action Bronson and Roc Marciano on the record cause these guys are really poppin right now . It might add a little flavor to the record for maybe a younger listener who is more in-tuned to what theyre doing right now , and obviously they destroyed it . I have a tremendous amount of respect for them , so it was just a good fit for the album . # Esoteric also spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well that was something that I wanted to do for the album . One of the things that always stood out to me with Deck was that hed reference superheroes every once in a whilesomething about the claws of Wolverine , Peter Parkerall these different things . Ive always been into comic books , and I think our discography kind of shows everything with that . But I kinda think thats how we meet too , and if we had a figurehead for the album , I came up with ' ' CZARFACE ' ' the name . I ran it by Deck , and he loved it , and then I had to find an artist that kind of brings ' ' CZARFACE ' ' to life . I wanted it to be very Jack Kirby influenced . I just love Jack Kirbys art . Lamour Supreme , who works for Mishka , had done stuff for Jack Kirbys museum , and it made a lot of sense for him to do the art and he killed it . He developed ' ' CZARFACE ' ' based on the ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to look like and what he represented . I would reference Ultron and Major Blood and all these different metal-clad villains or heroes , and he just went with it . Were really happy with what he created . # Critical response # ' ' Czarface ' ' was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 78 , based on 6 reviews , which indicates positive reviews . Omar Burgess of HipHopDX gave the album four out of five stars , saying ' ' CZARFACE ' ' has no major flaws . Its obviously not for everyone , yet even when incorporating current critical favorites like Action Bronson and Mr. MFN eXquire , no compromises are made . Inspectah Deck , 7L &amp; Esoteric use ' 90s East Coast Hip Hop as a blueprint to innovate , and ultimately , thats what made that era so special in the first place . Bogar Alonso of ' ' XXL ' ' gave the album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed last golden era , might make some queeze , and for good reason . Hip-hop purists have long sucked on the decade like a warm thumb , afraid of the cold , mean world that lay ahead . But ' ' CZARFACE ' ' , also the name for Deck and co. s group , keeps matters as fresh . The albums marqueewith names like Roc Marciano , Action Bronson , and Mr. MFN eXquireassures just that . Cement 3s , Its Raw , and Poisonous Thoughtslisted in the order of appearance of the guests mentionedcome off as love letters rather than industry rub-offs . If the above trio were operating in the late 90s , theyd be dropping similar heat . Bryan Hahn of ' ' The Source ' ' gave the album a positive review , saying ' ' Czarface ' ' does n't fall short of what it wanted to accomplish-knocking the chumps out the ring . It does n't pretend to deliver positive messages for the kids or even tell heart wrenching stories about the hood . Plain and simple , 7L masterminded sinister beats while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential of the often-mislead art of lyricism can sound like . Long live , ' ' Czarface ' ' . Matthew Fiander of PopMatters gave the album a six out of ten , saying Song to song we see confident production and expert rhyming from guys we know can do both . But while Inspectah Deck may be one of the most effortless emcees in Wu-Tang , he s not the most narrative . Neither is Esoteric . So while the songs here bang in all the ways you want , they rarely catch you off guard and they rarely tell you where theyre going . Not that they need to , but that sense of direction , out of the past and toward something new , might have elevated a good album to something great . Mark Bozzer of ' ' Exclaim ! ' ' gave the album a seven out of ten , saying Minus all of the corny sound bites , this album undoubtedly keeps the underground renaissance sizzling . # Commercial performance # The album debuted at number 34 on the US Billboard Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listing #
