This designation did not yet apply to the early eleventh century to the political or administrative divisions . However , the woodland was divided between the Perche County Corbon ( Mortagne ) , the Barony of Chateauneuf , the county and the bishopric of Chartres , the Viscount of Chateaudun and County Vendome . Progressive clearing of this forest was back up the pole and left the Thymerais . Crossroads , the town is now a chief of the canton and the center of the Community of common Thymerais. # History # In 1058 , Albert Ribaud , lord of Thymerais , who took a stand against William the Conqueror , Duke of Normandy and future king of England , the latter seized Thimert and left there a governor , but the following year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ castle and razed . It was reconstructed by Gaston , brother of Albert Ribaud built a short distance in a clearing in the woods , a fort named Chastel-neuf . It was formed around a village of the same name , which soon became the capital of Thymerais . From a standpoint feudal , in 1200 the Thymerais formed one great fief whose center was Chteauneuf-en-thymerais . The Chtellerie Chteauneuf-en-Thymerais covered an area roughly bounded by the north Avre river and Eure River south and east . The Chtellerie covered more than 80 villages within these limits but also villages in Eure : Acon , Armentieres-sur-Avre in **30;71910;TOOLONG , Saint-Victor-sur-Avre , and the Department of Orne : Charencey , Moussonvilliers , Normandel and La Trinite-sur-Avre , all in Township of Tourouvre . Hughes who married Mabile , daughter of Roger de Montgomery and Mabile de Bellme , gave asylum to Chteauneuf , Robert Courteheuse , rebelled against his father after a quarrel with his brothers and the failure to take the Castle of Rouen . William the Conqueror came to then , in 1078 , the headquarters of Regmalard , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Perche , Count of Mortagne , lord of Regmalard . The castle was sacked in 1169 by King Henry I of England , following the destruction of Chennebrun , located on the left bank of the Avre the previous year by the King of France . The castle was again attacked by Henry II of England , who burned the fortress , but it was rebuilt in 1189 by Hughes III du Chatel , lord of Thymerais . Hughes III received the castle of King Louis VII of France on the occasion of the inauguration of the fair of Saint-Jacques Boutaincourt . St. Thomas Chapel was built at that time in the suburbs of the town ( now St Thomas Road between Chartres and those of Nogent-le-Roi ) . Closed for worship since the French Revolution , she was raised in honor of St. Thomas Becket , Archbishop of Cantorby . In 1269 , King Louis IX of France or St. Louis , came to Thimert went to the castle of Chateauneuf . At that time , a major exhibition under the patronage of Saint-Arnoult , held in July in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chateauneuf was erected in 1314 in peerage barony-vassal of the Kingdom of France , under the Tower of the Louvre . The barony was then composed of four castellanies : Chateauneuf , Brezolles , Senonches and Champrond en Gtine . The lordship of Champrond en Gastine was acquired in June 1310 by Charles I Count of Alenon and Perche , through an exchange with Enguerrand de Marigny , the king 's chamberlain , and Havis de Mons , his wife , who held it for Gaucher de Chatillon , Comte de Ponthieu . The barony of Chateauneuf-en-Thimerais stayed home Alenon until its extinction in 1525 with Charles IV of Alenon . During the Hundred Years War , the Bourguignons , under the command of Marchal de Longny took the city . Recovery thereafter , she was again captured by Warwick in 1418 , and Henry V of England installed there one of his lieutenants .

But the barony of Chateauneuf was not part of the prerogative of the Duc d'Alencon . Count Charles II of Alenon had inherited the barony third of his brother Louis , Count of Chartres , by sharing in 1335 and Pierre II of Alenon had acquired the other two thirds in 1370 , finally was acquired by Champrond Charles , in 1310 , and the two sisters of the Duke Charles , Franoise of Alenon , wife of Charles IV de Bourbon , duke of Vendome , and Anne of Alenon , Marquise of Montferrat , opposed the seizure by the king of the assets of their brother .

In February 1500 King Charles IX was erected and the lordships of Brezolles Senonches , sold under the name in the principality of Mantua , in favor of Louis de Gonzague , father of Charles and were erected into a principality under the name of Mantua . In 1591 , the Comte de Soissons , plundered the castle along with those of Arpentigny and La Ferte-Vidame . The castle was never rebuilt and returned to the royal domain Chteauneuf annexe and lords who resided Maillebois until about half of the eighteenth century .

The last traces of them were erased in the first half of the twentieth century to make way for new roads ( including street of Pont Tabarin , street of Petite Friche and Street Dulorens ) . In the twentieth century the city had to suffer bombardment during the year 1940 . The war was over , Chateauneuf saw the arrival of families of U.S. soldiers housed in a subdivision south of the city and worked for many of them on the U.S. air base south of Crucey Brezolles .

5840514 The Battle of Opis , fought in September 539 BC , was a major engagement between the armies of Persia under Cyrus the Great and the Neo-Babylonian Empire under Nabonidus during the Persian invasion of Mesopotamia . At the time , Babylonia was the last major power in western Asia that was not yet under Persian control . The battle was fought in or near the strategic riverside city of Opis , north of the capital Babylon . It resulted in a decisive defeat for the Babylonians . A few days later , the city of Sippar surrendered to the Persians and Cyrus 's forces entered Babylon apparently without a fight . Cyrus was subsequently proclaimed king of Babylonia and its subject territories , thus ending the independence of Babylon and incorporating the Babylonian Empire into the greater Persian Empire . # Location # The site of the battle was at the city of Opis on the river Tigris , located about 50 miles ( 80 km ) north of modern Baghdad . The city is thought to have been a preferred point to cross the river ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion may have been determined by the ebb of the Mesopotamian rivers , which are at their lowest levels - and therefore are easiest to cross - in the early autumn . Opis was a place of considerable strategic importance ; apart from the river crossing , it was at one end of the Median Wall , a fortified defensive barrier north of Babylon that had been built several decades earlier by Nebuchadnezzar II . Control of Opis would have enabled Cyrus to break through the Median Wall and open the road to the capital . # Sources # The main contemporary source of information on Cyrus 's Mesopotamian campaign of 539 BC is the Nabonidus Chronicle , one of a series of clay tablets collectively known as the Babylonian Chronicles that record the history of ancient Babylonia . Some additional detail is provided by one of the few documents to have survived from Cyrus 's lifetime , the Cyrus Cylinder . Further information on Cyrus 's campaign is provided by the later ancient Greek writers Herodotus and Xenophon , though neither mention the battle at Opis and their accounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most scholars prefer to use the Nabonidus Chronicle as the main source on the battle , as it is a contemporaneous source . Although much of the Nabonidus Chronicle is fragmentary , the section relating to the last year of Nabonidus 's reign - 539 BC - is mostly intact . It provides very little information about Cyrus 's activities in the years immediately preceding the battle . The chronicler focuses on events of immediate relevance to Babylonia and its rulers , only occasionally records events outside Babylonia and does not provide much detail other than a bare outline of key incidents . There is almost no information for the period 547-539 . Most of the chronicle 's text for this period is illegible , making it impossible to assess the significance of the few words that can be read . # Background # At the time of the Battle of Opis , Persia was the leading power in the Near East . Its power had grown enormously under its king , Cyrus II , who had conquered a huge swathe of territory to create an empire that covered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Azerbaijan , Iran , Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan . The only remaining significant unconquered power in the Near East was the Neo-Babylonian Empire , which controlled Mesopotamia and subject kingdoms such as Syria , Judea , Phoenicia and parts of Arabia . It had been closely linked with Cyrus 's enemies elsewhere . The empire was previously an ally of Croesus of Lydia , whose kingdom was overrun by the Persians a few years prior to the invasion of Babylonia . By the time of the battle , Babylonia was in an unpromising geopolitical situation ; the Persian empire bordered it to the north , east and west . It had also been suffering severe economic problems exacerbated by plague and famine , and its king Nabonidus was said to be unpopular among many of his subjects for his unconventional religious policies . According to Mary Joan Winn Leith , Cyrus 's success is credited to military acumen , to judicious bribery , and to an energetic publicity campaign waged throughout Babylonia , which portrayed him as a lenient and religiously tolerant overlord . On the other hand , Max Mallowan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule and there is no question that Cyrus himself was a liberal-minded promoter of this humane and intelligent policy , and such a publicity campaign was in effect a means of permitting his reputation to proceed his military campaign . Cyrus was said to have persuaded a Babylonian provincial governor named Gobryas ( and a supposed Gadates ) to defect to his side . Gutium , the territory governed by Gobryas , was a frontier region of considerable size and strategic importance , which Cyrus was said to have used as the starting point for his invasion . The Nabonidus Chronicle records that prior to the battle , Nabonidus had ordered cult statues from outlying Babylonian cities to be brought into the capital , suggesting that the conflict had begun possibly in the winter of 540 BC . In a fragmentary section of the chronicle which is presumed to cover 540/39 BC , there is a possible reference to fighting , a mention of Ishtar and Uruk , and a possible reference to Persia . The Battle of Opis was thus probably only the final stage in an ongoing series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Nabonidus Chronicle records that the battle took place in the month of Tashritu ( 27 September-27 October ) at Opis on the bank of the Tigris . Very little is known about the events of the battle ; the chronicle does not provide any details of the battle 's course , the disposition of the forces on either side or the casualties inflicted . The Persian army under Cyrus fought the army of Akkad ( meaning the Babylonians in general , not the city of that name ) . The identity of the Babylonian commander is not recorded in the chronicle but it has traditionally been assumed that Belshazzar , the son of Nabonidus , was in command . His fate is unclear and he may have been killed in the battle . The outcome of the battle was clearly a Babylonian defeat , possibly a rout , as the defeated Babylonian army is not mentioned again in the chronicle . Following the battle the Persian forces took plunder from the defeated Babylonians . Most translations of the Chronicle also refer to a massacre of the people of Akkad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed - the population of Opis or the retreating Babylonian army . Pierre Briant comments : This victory was followed by an immense haul of booty and the massacre of those who attempted to resist . Andrew Robert Burn comments : Indeed on one reading of the text , Akkad broke out into open revolt , and Nabonidus ' last military achievement was slaughter of rebels . Maria Brosius interprets the massacre as a punitive action , making an example of a city trying to resist the Persian army . Cuyler Young comments on the Chronicle accounts : This reference in the Chronicle suggests that the Persians captured intact the main camp of Nabonidus ' army and that , as is so often the case , the real killing of the engagement came after the Babylonians had fallen prey to fear and panic and had retreated from the field . Amlie Kuhrt comments that the references to a massacre and looting suggest that the battle was probably a hard-won victory . W. G. Lambert argues a contrarian view that there was no massacre or slaughter at all . The battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which portrays Cyrus as liberating Babylon peacefully and with the consent of its people . However , the battle demonstrates that the existing Babylonian regime actively resisted Cyrus 's invasion of Mesopotamia. # Aftermath # The defeat at Opis appears to have ended any serious resistance to the Persian invasion . The Nabonidus Chronicle states that following the battle , on the fourteenth day 6 October Sippar was captured without battle . Nabonidus fled . The chronicle 's wording implies that Nabonidus was present in Sippar when the Persians arrived . Cyrus remained in Sippar , and on the sixteenth day 12 October Ug/Gubaru , governor of Gutium , and the army of Cyrus without a battle entered Babylon . Nabonidus himself was captured shortly afterward when he returned to Babylon . His ultimate fate is unclear , but according to the 3rd century BC Babylonian historian Berossus , Nabonidus was spared and he went into exile in Carmania , where he died years later . Persian troops took control of the city , though the Nabonidus Chronicle provides little detail of how this was done . The chronicle makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city 's most important temples and records that Interruption of ( rites/cults ) in the Esagila temple or the other temples there was none , and no date was missed . Seventeen days later , on 29 October , Cyrus himself entered Babylon , where he was proclaimed king , issued royal proclamations and appointed governors of his newly conquered realm . Ancient Greek accounts of Cyrus 's campaign and the fall of Babylon differ significantly from the cuneiform accounts preserved in the Nabonidus Chronicle and the Cyrus Cylinder , suggesting that the Greeks were drawing onor perhaps inventingdifferent traditions about the conquest of Babylonia . The two ancient Greek sources for the campaign , Herodotus and Xenophon , present broadly similar versions of events . According to Herodotus , Cyrus marched to Babylon along the side of the Diyala river ( past Opis , though the battle is not mentioned ) , where the Persians fought a battle with the Babylonians near the capital . Cyrus subsequently laid siege to Babylon , ordering his troops to dig a canal to drain off part of the Euphrates to enable his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defences . Xenophon provides a similar but more elaborate account , claiming that Cyrus dug a huge trench around the city to divert the Euphrates and make the river bed passable for the Persian army . Herodotus , Xenophon and the Biblical Book of Daniel all assert that the Babylonians were taken by surprise while celebrating a festival . Berossus presents an account that is different again , asserting that Cyrus defeated Nabonidus , who fled with certain others and shut himself up in Borsippa . Meanwhile Cyrus occupied Babylon and ordered to destroy the exterior walls of the city , because the city seemed very formidable to him and difficult to capture . Afterward Cyrus marched to Borsippa , in order to organize the siege against Nabonidus . But Nabonidus did not await the end of the siege , and surrendered . These accounts , written long after the Persian conquest , contradict many aspects of the contemporary cuneiform evidence , which does not mention any sieges , engineering works or battles near Babylon . The cuneiform descriptions of a peaceful surrender of Babylon are corroborated by archaeological evidence from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been found in the layers corresponding to the fall of the city to the Persians . Scholars are in general agreement that Herodotus 's account is an invention , while Kuhrt comments that Xenophon 's account in his ' ' Cyropedia ' ' is virtually impossible to use .. as a strictly historical source due to its literary form , as a moral treatise on Cyrus in the form of an historical novella . Paul-Alain Beaulieu suggests that the Greek accounts may constitute an aggregate of various folk tales and legends which came to be associated with the fall of Babylon . David George Hogarth and Samuel Rolles Driver comment on what they saw as Herodotus 's unreliability : According to the Behistun Inscription , Babylon revolted twice against Darius , and was recaptured on the second occasion by his general Gobryas . Herodotus only mentions the first revolt of Babylon in which Zopyrus captured the city for Darius , and omits this second revolt . # Historiography # The Babylonian defeat at Opis and the apparently unopposed Persian entry into Babylon ended the independence of Babylonia ( although there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . That the Babylonian collapse was swift and apparently total is confirmed by the ancient accounts of Cyrus 's campaign in Mesopotamia and corroborating evidence such as cuneiform inscriptions dating to shortly after the Persian conquest . A number of explanations have been advanced for the rapid collapse of the Babylonian state . The Cyrus Cylinder and the roughly contemporary Verse Account of Nabonidus attribute Nabonidus 's failure to the desire of the god Marduk to punish a regime that had opposed his will . The strongly anti-Nabonidus tone of these documents , which accused the former king of behaving capriciously and neglecting the worship of the gods , suggests that their authors - the Babylonian priestly elite - were alienated from Nabonidus and may have welcomed a Persian takeover . It is , however , unclear how widely the Persians were supported within Babylonia , as accounts of the invasion and Nabonidus 's rule are coloured by Cyrus 's subsequent propaganda . Other writers have advanced a number of additional or alternative explanations for the Babylonian defeat . M. A. Dandamaev suggests variously that the regime suffered from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general population ; opposition from subject peoples such as the Jews , who may have seen the invading Persians as liberators ; and the inability of the Babylonian forces to resist numerically superior and better equipped opponents .

6148514 Constitutionally , the freedom of belief is absolute and the practice of religious rites is provided in Egypt , although the Government places restrictions on these rights in practice . Islam is the official state religion , and Shari'a ( Islamic law ) is the primary source of legislation . Although there were some positive steps in support of religious freedom , the status of respect for religious freedom by the Government declined overall during the period covered by this report . Members of non-Muslim religious minorities officially recognized by the Government generally worship without harassment and maintain links with coreligionists in other countries . However , members of religious groups that are not recognized by the Government , particularly the Baha'i Faith , experience personal and collective hardship . See Egyptian identification card controversy . A lower court ruling interpreted the Constitution 's guarantee of religious freedom as inapplicable to Muslim citizens who wish to convert to another religion . This ruling is under appeal . Separate court rulings provided for 13 Christian born converts to Islam to obtain identity documents indicating their conversion back to Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the courts included requirements effectively identifying the Christian converts and Baha'is as apostates , potentially exposing them , if implemented , to risk of significant discrimination by both governmental and societal agents . In addition , a lower court held that the Constitution 's guarantee of freedom of religion does not apply to Baha'is . Furthermore , governmental authorities detained some converts from Islam to Christianity , some religious freedom advocates , and some Christian children of parents who converted to Islam . The Government again failed to redress laws and governmental practices that discriminate against Christians , effectively allowing their discriminatory effects and their modeling effect on society to become further entrenched . According to some observers , police responses to some incidents of sectarian violence were slow . There continued to be religious discrimination and sectarian tension in society during the period covered by this report . There were several violent incidents in Upper Egypt , including an attack by Bedouins on the Abu Fana monastery , arson attacks on Christian-owned shops in Armant , and an attack on a Coptic Church and Coptic-owned shops in Esna . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received death threats and went into hiding with his wife after his case received wide attention in the Arabic language media . # Religious demography # The country has an area of 370308 sqmi and a population of over 80 million , of whom almost 90 percent were estimated to be Sunni Muslims . Shi'a Muslims constitute less than 1 percent of the population . Estimates of the percentage of Christians range from 10 to 20 percent , or between 8 and 15 million ( though estimates vary ) , the majority of whom belonged to the Coptic Orthodox Church . Other Christian communities include the Armenian Apostolic , Roman Catholic ( Armenian , Chaldean , Greek , Melkite , Roman , and Syrian Catholic ) , Maronite , and Orthodox ( Greek and Syrian ) churches . An evangelical Protestant community , established in the middle of the 19th century , included 16 Protestant denominations ( Presbyterian , Episcopal/Anglican , Baptist , Brethren , Open Brethren , Revival of Holiness ( Nahdat al-Qadaasa ) , Faith ( Al-Eyman ) , Church of God , Christian Model Church ( Al-Mithaal al-Masihi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Apostolic Grace , Church of Christ , Gospel Missionary ( Al-Kiraaza bil Ingil ) , and the Message Church of Holland ( Ar-Risaala ) . There are also followers of the Seventh-day Adventist Church , which was granted legal status in the 1960s . There are small numbers of Mormons and Jehovah 's Witnesses , but the Government does not recognize either group . The non-Muslim , non-Coptic Orthodox communities ranged in size from several thousand to hundreds of thousands . The number of Baha'is estimated at 2,000 persons . The Jewish community numbers fewer than 200 persons . Christians are dispersed throughout the country , although the percentage of Christians is higher in Upper Egypt ( the southern part of the country ) and some sections of Cairo and Alexandria . There are many foreign religious groups , especially Roman Catholics and Protestants who have had a presence in the country for almost a century . These groups engaged in education , social , and development work . # Status of religious freedom # # Legal and policy framework # The Constitution , under Article 46 , provides for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the Government restricts these rights in practice . Islam is the official state religion , and Shari'a is the primary source of legislation . The Government does not recognize conversions of Muslims to Christianity or other religions , and resistance to such conversions by local officialsthrough refusal to legally recognize conversionsconstitutes a prohibition in practice . January 2008 rulings by the Cairo Administrative Court stated that freedom to convert does not extend to Muslim citizens . This was under appeal at the end of the reporting period . It also ruled that constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion do not apply to Baha'is . Conversion is not illegal under civil law , but , in practice the Government does not recognize conversions of Muslim-born citizens to other religions . However , in January 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the Ministry of Interior ( MOI ) must issue identity documents indicating the conversion back to Christianity of some Christian-born converts to Islam . While there is no legal ban on proselytizing Muslims , the Government restricts such efforts . Neither the Constitution nor the Civil and Penal Codes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proselytizing on charges of ridiculing or insulting heavenly religions or inciting sectarian strife . For a religious group to be officially recognized , it must submit a request to the Religious Affairs Department of the MOI , which determines whether the group would , in its view , pose a threat or upset national unity or social peace . The Department also consults the leading religious figures , particularly the pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church and the sheikh of Al-Azhar . The registration is then referred to the president , who , if he concurs , issues a decree recognizing the new group , according to Law 15 of 1927 . If a religious group bypasses the official registration process , participants are subject to detention and could also face prosecution and punishment under Article 98(F) of the Penal Code , which forbids the denigration of religions . The Government last recognized a new religious group in 1990 . All mosques must be licensed by the Ministry of Islamic Endowments ( Awqaf ) . The Government appoints and pays the salaries of the imams who lead prayers in mosques and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding of Christian churches . The Ministry of Awqaf reported that there were 100,006 mosques and small dedicated prayer areas called zawayas nationwide as of April 2008 . A 2004 decree by the Minister of Awqaf removed from governors the authority to issue permits to build mosques and placed private mosques under Awqaf administrative control . However , approximately 5,000 mosques and zawayas remain unsupervised by the Ministry . The contemporary interpretation of the 1856 Ottoman Hamayouni Decree , partially still in force , requires non-Muslims to obtain a presidential decree to build new churches and synagogues . In addition , MOI regulations , issued in 1934 under the Al-Ezabi decree , specify a set of ten conditions that the Government must consider before a presidential decree for construction of a new non-Muslim place of worship can be issued . The conditions include the requirement that the distance between a church and a mosque not be less than 100 meters ( 340 feet ) and that approval of the neighboring Muslim community be obtained before a permit to build a new church may be issued . In 2005 President Mubarak issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 governors to grant permits to Christian denominations that seek to expand or rebuild existing churches . The decree also stated that churches could undertake basic repairs and maintenance subject only to the provision of written notification to the local authorities . Decree 291 noted that the governors must examine all applications for rebuilding or expansion , which must be supported by unspecified supporting documents , within thirty days of submission . According to the new decree , permits may not be refused except with a justified ruling . Decree 291 also cancelled a 1999 decree aimed at improving the permit process for church repair . ( Presidential Decree 453 of 1999 had made the repair of all places of worship subject to a 1976 civil construction code . Although this decree made mosque and church repairs technically subject to the same laws , authorities enforced the laws more strictly for churches . ) Two and a half years after promulgation of Decree 291/2005 , church and lay leaders complained that the permit process remains susceptible to delay by local officials . They charged that some local authorities refused to process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain ( e.g. , a presidential decree authorizing the existence of a church that had been established during the country 's monarchical era ) . Others complain that some local authorities categorize routine repairs and maintenance ( e.g. , painting of walls and plumbing repairs ) as expansion/reconstruction projects , thus requiring formal permits versus simple notification . They also maintain that security forces blocked them from using permits that had been issued , and at times denied them permits , for repairs to church buildings and the supply of water and electricity to existing church facilities . Such incidents often depended on the attitude of local security officials and the governorate leadership toward the church and on their personal relationships with representatives of the churches . As a result , congregations have experienced lengthy delaysyears in many caseswhile waiting for new building permits . Local authorities have closed down unlicensed places of worship . As a result of restrictions , some communities use private buildings and apartments for religious services or build without permits . Constitutional amendments , approved by referendum on March 27 , 2007 , have unclear implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution states that the country 's political system is based on the principle of citizenship . The amended Article 5 prohibits the formation of political parties or the conduct of political activities on a religious basis . Government supporters argued that these changes would separate religion from politics . Some critics argued , however , that the amendments are incompatible with Article 2 , which continues to state that Shari'a is the basis for legislation . The application of family law , including marriage , divorce , alimony , child custody , and burial , is based on an individual 's religion . In the practice of family law , the Government recognizes only the three heavenly religions , Islam , Christianity , and Judaism . Muslim families are subject to Shari'a , Christian families to canon law , and Jewish families to Jewish law . In cases of family law disputes involving a marriage between a Christian woman and a Muslim man , the courts apply Shari'a . The Government does not recognize the marriages of citizens adhering to religions other than Christianity , Judaism , or Islam . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convert to Islam to marry Muslim women , but non-Muslim women need not convert to marry Muslim men . Muslim women are prohibited from marrying Christian men . Under Shari'a as interpreted by the Government , a non-Muslim wife who converts to Islam must divorce her apostate , non-Muslim husband . Upon the wife 's conversion , local security authorities ask the non-Muslim husband if he is willing to convert to Islam ; if he chooses not to , divorce proceedings begin immediately and custody of children is awarded to the mother . Inheritance laws for all citizens are based on the Government 's interpretation of Shari'a . Muslim female heirs receive half the amount of a male heir 's inheritance . Christian widows of Muslims have no automatic inheritance rights but may be provided for in testamentary documents . Under Shari'a , converts from Islam lose all rights of inheritance . However , because the Government offers no legal means for converts from Islam to Christianity to amend their civil records to reflect their new religious status , the converts ' loss of inheritance rights may not be indicated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register their change in religious status , some converts resort to soliciting illicit identity papers , often by submitting fraudulent supporting documents or bribing government clerks who process the documents . In such cases , authorities periodically charge converts with violating laws prohibiting the falsification of documents . The law prescribes administrative steps pursuant to the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam . The minor children of such converts , and in some cases adult children , may automatically become classified as Muslims by the Government irrespective of the religion of the other parent . This practice is in accordance with the Government 's interpretation of Shari'a , which dictates no jurisdiction of a non-Muslim over a Muslim . Government authorities sometimes fail to uphold the law in sensitive conversion cases . Local authorities sometimes allow custody of a minor Christian female who converts to Islam to be transferred to a Muslim custodian , who is likely to grant approval for a marriage opposed by the girl 's Christian parents . ( Although the minimum age for marriage is 18 for both men and women , girls who are at least 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval of their parents , or , in cases where the girl asserts that she has converted to Islam , with the approval of a Muslim guardian . ) According to the Government 's Instructions for Notaries Public , which implement Law 114 of 1947 , persons age 16 and above may convert to Islam without parental consent . Christian activists assert that ignorance of the law and social pressure , including the centrality of marriage to a woman 's identity , often affect a girl 's decision to convert . Family conflict and financial pressure also are cited as factors . The Government reportedly halted the practice of requiring religious advice and guidance sessions in the case of Christian-born converts to Islam in 2006 without any prior notice or discussion . For many years , those guidance sessions had been instrumental in resolving disputed conversion cases ; in many instances , Christian girls returned to their original faith and families . Law 263 of 1960 , still in force , bans Baha'i institutions and community activities and strips Baha'is of legal recognition . During the Nasser era , the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libraries , and cemeteries . The Government has asserted that national identity cards require all citizens to be categorized as Muslims , Christians , or Jews . The MOI has reportedly , on rare occasions , issued documents that list a citizen 's religion as other or simply do not mention religion ; however , it is not clear when these conditions apply . Baha'is and other religious groups not associated with any of the three heavenly religions have been compelled either to misrepresent themselves or go without valid identity documents . Those without valid identity cards also encounter difficulty registering their children in school , opening bank accounts , and establishing businesses . Baha'is at age 16 face additional problems under Law 143/1994 , which makes it mandatory for all citizens to obtain a new identification card featuring a new national identification number . Police occasionally conduct random inspections of identity papers and those found without identity cards can be detained until the document is provided . Some Baha'is without identity cards reportedly stay home to avoid police scrutiny and possible arrest . The law provides for khul ' divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without her husband 's consent , provided that she is willing to forego all of her financial rights , including alimony , dowry , and other benefits . Many women have complained that after being granted khul ' , the required child support is not paid . The Coptic Orthodox Church excommunicates female members who marry Muslim men and requires that other Christians convert to Coptic Orthodoxy to marry a member of the church . Coptic males are prevented from marrying Muslim women by both civil and religious laws . A civil marriage abroad is an option should a Christian male and a Muslim female citizen decide to marry ; however , their marriage would not be legally recognized in the country . Additionally , the woman could be arrested and charged with apostasy , and any children from such a marriage could be taken and assigned to the physical custody of a male Muslim guardian , as determined by the Government 's interpretation of Shari'a . The Coptic Orthodox Church permits divorce only in specific circumstances , such as adultery or conversion of one spouse to another religion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has , to varying degrees , subjected them to harassment and surveillance . The Witnesses were legally registered in Cairo in 1951 and Alexandria in 1956 and their presence in the country dates to the 1930s . The Government attributes its refusal to grant the Jehovah 's Witnesses registration to the opposition of the Coptic Orthodox Church , which has condemned the group as heretical , as well as to its lingering Nasser-era suspicion of links between Witnesses and the State of Israel . Various ministries are legally authorized to ban or confiscate books and works of art upon obtaining a court order . The Council of Ministers may order the banning of works that it deems offensive to public morals , detrimental to religion , or likely to cause a breach of the peace . The Islamic Research Center ( IRC ) at Al-Azhar University has legal authority to censor and , since 2004 , confiscate , any publications dealing with the Qur'an and the authoritative Islamic traditions ( Hadith ) . In recent years , the IRC has also passed judgment on the suitability of nonreligious books and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiscations , but must obtain a court order to do so . The Government granted confiscatory authority to Al-Azhar University and acted on its recommendations . In 2003 the Ministry of Justice issued a decree authorizing Al-Azhar sheikhs to confiscate publications , tapes , speeches , and artistic materials deemed inconsistent with Islamic law . There were no reports of the exercise of this authority during the reporting period . The Government has not granted legal recognition to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) , or Mormons , in Cairo . The LDS Church has maintained an organized congregation in the country for more than 30 years . The Government has raised no objection . Some members , particularly those who have converted to the LDS Church overseas and then returned to the country , complain of excessive surveillance from State Security and sometimes avoid meetings from fear of harassment . The Government outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood , which operates missionary , charitable , and political activities , in 1954 but has tolerated its operations with varying levels of interference . Muslim Brothers speak openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organization , although they remain subject to arbitrary detention and pressure from the Government . The Government at times prosecutes members of religious groups whose practices are deemed to deviate from mainstream Islamic beliefs and whose activities are alleged to jeopardize communal harmony . The Government has advised journalists and cartoonists to avoid anti-Semitism . Government officials insist that anti-Semitic statements in the media are a reaction to Israeli government actions against Palestinians and do not reflect historical anti-Semitism ; however , there are few public attempts to distinguish between anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli sentiment . The quasi governmental National Council for Human Rights ( NCHR ) is charged with furthering protections , raising awareness , and ensuring the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , including religious freedom . It is also charged with monitoring enforcement and application of international agreements . Five of its 25 reappointed members , as well as its president , are Copts . The NCHR , in its fourth report , issued in March 2008 , reported that it received 35 complaints from Christian families alleging that their daughters were missing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cases replied that the women had eloped with Muslim men , converted to Islam of their free will , and had chosen to leave their families without prior notice because they feared reprisal on the part of their families . The report also stated that the NCHR had received 29 formal complaints pertaining to religious freedom , which it sent to relevant authorities for action . The NCHR received an additional 21 complaints from Baha'is who were denied government identification documents . In its report , the NCHR called on the Government to permit the designation Baha'i on government identification documents ( see Restrictions on Religious Freedom ) . The local media , including state television and newspapers , give prominence to Islamic programming . Christian television programs are aired weekly on state-owned Nile Cultural TV . The weekly religion page of the prominent daily Al-Ahram often reports on conversions to Islam and claims that converts improved their lives and found peace and moral stability . The Ministry of Education bans wearing the hijab ( Islamic head veil ) in primary schools and allows it only in preparatory and secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In January 2008 , continuing a practice that resumed in 2005 , Jewish pilgrims ( mostly visitors from Israel ) celebrated the Abu Hasira festival despite a 2004 Supreme Administrative Court decision banning the annual festival at the tomb of Rabbi Abu Hasira in a village in the Nile Delta . # Abuses of religious freedom # On March , 2014 , Alexandria Security Directorate chief Amin Ezz El-Din announced in a televised telephone interview that a special police taskforce will be formed to arrest a group of Alexandria-based atheists who declared their beliefs on Facebook , the talk show also interviewed an activist who says he is an atheist , the talk show host said that atheism is a foreign plot at a critical time for Egypt , as the country continues to experience political , economic and social instability ; he also called for the arrest and execution of that activist ( named Mostafa Zakareya ) on account of him being atheist . On May 31 , 2008 , police located within 1 mile of the Abu Fana Monastery in Upper Egypt reportedly took 3 hours to respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monastery was under attack . The armed assault resulted in the death of one Muslim Bedouin villager , multiple injuries , including gunshot wounds , to monks , the kidnapping and abuse of several monks , and looting and damages estimated at more than 1,000,000 Egyptian pounds . Three monks abducted from the monastery were reportedly rescued by security services ( see societal abuses or discrimination ) . On January 29 , 2008 , the Cairo Administrative Court , a court of first impression , ruled that the administrative agency of the Civil Status Department was not bound to examine the request of Muhammad Ahmad Abduh Higazy to have his new religion , Christianity , recorded on his national identity card as so doing would conflict with public order . In its ruling , the court wrote that Muslims are forbidden from converting away from Islam based on principles of Islamic law , and because such conversion would constitute a disparagement of the official state religion and an enticement for other Muslims to convert . The court asserted its duty to protect public order from the crime of apostasy from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apostate petitions the administration to condone his misdeed and his corrupt caprice . In August 2007 Mohamed Ahmed Higazy and his wife Zeinab had publicly announced that they had converted to Christianity and wished to be legally recognized as such . The ruling maintained a government policy not to provide a legal means for converts from Islam to Christianity to amend their civil records to reflect their new religious status . Higazy 's attorney appealed the case in March 2008 , and it remained under appeal at the end of the reporting period . The Government continued to deny civil documents , including identity cards , birth certificates , and marriage licenses , to members of the Baha'i community . However , on January 29 , 2008 , the Cairo Administrative Court ruled that the MOI must issue identification documents to Baha'is , with the religious affiliation space filled with a dash . While the ruling was not applied to other Baha'is , members of the Baha'i community reported anecdotally that the ruling was assisting them in obtaining some civil documents ( see Introduction and Legal/Policy Framework ) . The newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented student Kholoud Hafez Abdou from sitting for her final graduating examinations because she identified herself as a Baha'i on her examination admission application . Students are required to enter their religion on the application form necessary for admission to the examination . This case generated extensive media coverage , and the Ministry of Education overruled the administrator 's decision . The Ministry of Education resolved the matter by asking Kholoud to fill out another application form with dashes entered in the religion field of the application . On July 15 , 2007 , a female convert from Islam to Christianity , Shaimaa Muhammad al-Sayed , was rescued by police while being beaten in public by attackers and arrested following police verification that she was the daughter of one of the attackers who claimed that she was a convert to Christianity and that he had previously filed a missing persons report on her . She was found to be in possession of a falsified identity card listing her religion as Christianity and reportedly held on charges of falsifying a government document . The Office of Prosecutor General , Supreme State Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2007 , and confiscated both her original identity card and the counterfeit one . According to credible reports , after her release , her father beat her in front of the police station . On May 29 , 2007 , State Security agents arrested three men affiliated with the Qurani movement , a small group of Muslims who rely largely if not exclusively on the Qur'an as authoritative for Islam , to the exclusion of the prophetic traditions ( Hadith ) and other sources of Islamic law . On May 31 and June 17 , 2007 , they arrested two additional Quranis . One detainee reported to a lawyer with an independent human rights organization that prior to June 30 , 2007 , he had been beaten and threatened with rape by a State Security investigator . On October 5 , 2007 , authorities released the five men . In December 2007 the authorities arrested 25 members of the Islamic Al-Ahbash sect , including three Lebanese and a Kazakh , on charges of membership in an illegal organization and contempt for religion . In February , the Public Prosecutor ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-Egyptians were reportedly deported . On March 12 , 2007 , the Alexandria Court of Appeal upheld the conviction of 22-year old student blogger Abdel Karim Nabil Suleiman . On February 22 , 2007 , the Alexandria Criminal Court convicted him of denigrating Islam and insulting President Mubarak through his blog entries and sentenced him to 4 years in prison ( 3 for denigrating Islam and 1 for insulting the president ) . On November 6 , 2006 , Alexandria security forces arrested Abdel Karim , whose blog entries had contained strongly worded critiques of the practice of Islam and Al-Azhar 's Sunni Muslim orthodoxy . Abdel Karim had previously been detained on account of his writings for 18 days in October 2005 . He had been expelled and reported to the authorities by Al-Azhar University for criticizing Islamic authority . He remained in prison at the end of the reporting period . On August 8 , 2007 , police detained Adel Fawzi Faltas Hanna , a retired doctor and president of the Middle East Christian Association 's ( MECA ) Egyptian branch , and Peter Ezzat Hanna , a photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities investigated the two men 's activities , on charges including allegedly denigrating Islam and disturbing the public order . On July 7 , 2007 , Nader Fawzi , in his capacity as president of MECA , had filed a lawsuit naming President Mubarak and five senior ministers as defendants , accusing the Government of failing to properly investigate the al-Kosheh incident of January 13 , 2000 , in which 21 Copts were killed , others wounded , and Copt properties destroyed , and concerning which the perpetrators were not brought to justice and no indemnity to the victims or their families was paid . Also , near the time of the arrests , the MECA had publicly indicated its support of Muhammad Higazy , who had announced that he was suing the Government for the right to have his conversion to Christianity indicated on his civil documents . The police also raided the Cairo homes of Adel Fawzi and Peter Ezzat and reportedly confiscated several copies of a MECA publication , The Persecuted : The Story of the Coptic Nation . On November 4 , authorities released Adel Fawzi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 , authorities arrested three other MECA affiliates , whom authorities also investigated for a variety of charges , including denigrating Islam . On December 26 , 2007 , authorities released the three men without charges . During the reporting period , State Security agents reportedly detained at least two Jehovah 's Witnesses and , during interrogations , threatened them and their families with ongoing harassment unless they agreed to become informants on the Witness community . Witness leadership also reported that authorities monitored the homes , telephones , and meeting places of Jehovah 's Witnesses and interrogated them in some cases . International Witness leadership reported that at least three Witnesses were beaten while in police custody in 2007 , 2006 , and 2005 . While Witnesses have reported varying degrees of harassment and surveillance by government agents since 1960 , senior international Witness leadership believed that their engagement of the Government over the past 2 years concerning their request for official recognition had resulted in a diminishment of the policy of harassment and hostile surveillance . The Government continued to try citizens for unorthodox religious beliefs . In 2005 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case involving Ibrahim Ahmad Abu Shusha and 11 of his followers , who had been detained absent an arrest warrant since 2004 . The court sentenced Abu Shusha to 3 years ' imprisonment for claiming to be divine and denigrating Islam . The court sentenced the 11 other defendants ( including 3 women , 2 of whom are Abu Shusha 's wives ) to 1 year of imprisonment and ordered the confiscation of the leaflets and writings that propagated the group 's ideology . In its reasoning , the court stated that there was sufficient evidence that Abu Shusha embraced beliefs that are contrary to and derogatory of Islam and that he tried to propagate those beliefs by attempting to show that he possessed divine powers . The court also asserted that freedom of belief does not include permission to deny the principles of heavenly religions . An appeals court reaffirmed the Abu Shusha sentences in July 2005 . At the end of the reporting period , Abu Shusha 's lawyers were seeking to appeal his case to the Court of Cassation and his case remained pending . While there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were occasional reports that police persecuted converts from Islam to Christianity . In April 2005 State Security authorities detained Bahaa Al-Accad , a citizen who was born Muslim but who reportedly converted to Christianity . Accad was initially held at Tora Prison , south of Cairo . After a court ordered Accad 's release from detention in August 2006 , State Security authorities deliberately ignored the ruling , eventually transferring him to Wadi el-Natroun Prison , located 60 miles north of Cairo along the highway to Alexandria . On April 28 , 2007 , the authorities released Accad after he had spent almost 2 years in prison without being formally charged with any crime . The security services reportedly maintain regular and sometimes hostile surveillance of Muslim-born citizens who are suspected of having converted to Christianity . In May 2006 public prosecutor Maher Abdul Wahid ordered two Azharites , Abdul Sabur al-Kashef and Mohammed Radwan , to be tried by a low-level criminal court on charges of blaspheming Islam . Kashef was prosecuted for claiming to have seen God while Radwan was prosecuted for denying the existence of heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprisonment while Radwan received 3 years . In mid-January 2007 El-Gamaleya Misdemeanor Court of Appeals reduced Kashef 's sentence to 6 years ' imprisonment and upheld the earlier ruling of 3 years for Radwan . At the end of the reporting period , they remained in prison . On November 21 , 2007 , Shadia Nagy Ibrahim , 47 , was sentenced to three years in prison for allegedly falsely claiming to be Christian , a charge arising from her father 's brief conversion to Islam in 1962 . She had listed her religion as Christian on her marriage certificate in 1982 , not knowing that her father 's brief conversion to Islam in 1962 made her official religion Islam , according to the country 's interpretation of Islamic law . On January 13 , 2008 , the Public Prosecutor ordered her release . On May 5 , 2008 , her sister , Bahya Nagy Ibrahim , was reportedly arrested on similar charges . She remained in custody at the end of the reporting period . There were reports that the Government began harassing some Christian clergy and other Christian leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for flights , and that they confiscated address books , written materials and various forms of recordable media . On November 22 , 2007 , police detained Siham Ibrahim Muhammad Hassan al-Sharqawi , a Muslim convert to Christianity , on the outskirts of Qena , 300 miles south of Cairo , who had been in hiding since 2003 . She was interrogated for 4 days and released . In August 2007 authorities investigated seven Copt employees of the MOI in fraud and bribery cases in connection with re-converts to Christianity . The investigation was reportedly ongoing at the end of the reporting period . An estimated several thousand persons were imprisoned during the reporting period because of alleged support foror membership inIslamist groups seeking to overthrow the Government . The Government stated that these persons were in detention because of membership in or activities on behalf of violent extremist groups , without regard to their religious affiliation .

Reports of such cases are disputed and often include inflammatory allegations and categorical denials of kidnapping and rape . Observers , including human rights groups , find it extremely difficult to determine whether compulsion was used , as most cases involve a female Copt who converts to Islam when she marries a Muslim male . Reports of such cases almost never appear in the local media . Divorce is not allowed to Coptic women , so many of them try to leave their men by converting to Islam . Wafaa Constantin , a Christian woman whose alleged conversion to Islam in December 2004 sparked significant protests in Cairo , remained in seclusion in a Coptic church facility . During the reporting period , the Administrative Judicial Court of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 attorneys demanding that Wafaa Constantin be handed over to Al-Azhar , on the strength of her declaration that she had embraced Islam . As a Muslim citizen , he argued , the Church has no jurisdiction over her in accordance with Article Two of the Constitution . On April 24 , 2007 , the State Council ruled that Constantin had chosen to remain Christian . At the end of the reporting period she remained in seclusion in a Church facility . In February 2007 Muslim citizens set fire to Christian-owned shops in the village of Armant , Qena Governorate , after reports of a love affair between a Muslim woman and a Coptic Christian man . Security forces deployed in the town , closed shops under a security decree , and detained eight Muslims and one Copt . Member of Parliament Mohamed al-Nubi and village leaders initiated a national conference on inter-religious dialogue to address the sectarian divide and reportedly brought together some 2,000 Muslims and Christians from across the country . There are reports of government authorities failing to uphold the law in sensitive conversion cases . Local authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Islam to be transferred to a Muslim custodian , who is likely to grant approval for a marriage opposed by the girl 's Christian parents .

Christian activists assert that ignorance of the law and social pressure , including the centrality of marriage to a woman 's identity , often affect a girl 's decision to convert . Family conflict and financial pressure also are cited as factors . According to Watani newspaper editor and publisher , Youssef Sidhom , and Christian lawyer Naguib Gabriel , the reporting period witnessed the apparent cessation of the required religious advice and guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Sidhom , the advice and guidance sessions had proved repeatedly to be instrumental in resolving disputed conversion cases , returning many Christian girls to their original faith and families . Sidhom complained that the decision to annul the advice and guidance sessions was taken by the Interior Ministry without any prior notice or discussion . Gabriel filed a lawsuit before the administrative court to restore the advice and guidance sessions , but the court issued no judgment by the end of the reporting period . There were no reports of the forced religious conversion of minor U.S. citizens who may have been abducted or illegally removed from the United States . According to the survey in 2010 by the Pew Global Attitudes Project , 84% of Egyptians polled supported the death penalty for those who leave the Muslim religion . # Anti-Semitism # The country 's Jewish community numbers 200 , most of them senior citizens . Anti-Semitic sentiments appeared in both the government-owned and opposition press ; however , there have been no violent anti-Semitic incidents in recent years . Anti-Semitic articles and opinion pieces appeared in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and electronic media . Anti-Semitism in the media was common , but less prevalent than in recent years , and anti-Semitic editorial cartoons and articles depicting demonic images of Jews and Israeli leaders , stereotypical images of Jews along with Jewish symbols , and comparisons of Israeli leaders to Hitler and the Nazis were published throughout the year . These expressions occurred primarily in the government-sponsored daily newspapers , Al-Gumhuriyya , Akhbar Al-Yawm , and Al-Ahram , but elicited no government response . For example , on August 7 , 2006 , in an article in the government-controlled daily newspaper Al-Ahram , the Grand Mufti Ali Gom'a criticized recent Israeli military action in Lebanon and wrote that Israeli lies have exposed the true and hideous face of the blood suckers who ... planned to prepare a matzo unleavened Passover bread using human blood . On August 24 , 2006 , a Muslim cleric , Safwat Higazi , appeared on Dream TV to discuss recent media reports that he had issued a ruling ( on the Islamic Al-Nas channel ) that permitted the killing of Israeli Jews in Egypt . Higazi opined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are serving in the Israeli Defense Forces reserves ) in the country was permissible . On September 13 , 2006 , Al-Ahram published an opinion column entitled Who is the Nazi Now and stated that The war that Hitler led against the Jews was an excuse through which the Zionists justified their colonizing of Palestine .. But the Jews , who escaped from oppression , oppressed the Palestinians and thus , the victims of the old Nazis became the new Nazis ... Who is the Nazi now ? Gnther Grass , who admitted the mistake he made when he was an adolescent ? Or David Ben Gurion , Begin , Shamir , Sharon , Olmert , and people of their kind ? The Government has advised journalists and cartoonists to avoid anti-Semitism . Government officials insist that anti-Semitic statements in the media are a reaction to Israeli government actions against Palestinians and do not reflect historical anti-Semitism ; however , there are few public attempts to distinguish between anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli sentiment . # Coptic Christians # Laws concerning Coptic Christians which place restrictions on church building and open worship have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval , while sporadic attacks on Christians and churches continue . Coptic Christians face discrimination at multiple levels of the government , ranging from a disproportional representation in government ministries to laws that limit their ability to build or repair churches . The Pew Forum ranks Egypt among the 12 worst countries in the world in terms of religious violence against religious minorities and in terms of social hostilities against Christians . Coptic Christians are minimally represented in law enforcement , state security , and public office , and are being discriminated against in the workforce on the basis of their religion . The Coptic community , as well as several human rights activists and intellectuals , maintain that the number of Christians occupying government posts is not proportional to the number of Copts in Egypt . They are also the victims of discriminatory religious laws , anti-Christian judges , and anti-Christian state police . Anti-Christian laws include laws governing repairing old churches or constructing new ones , which are usually impossible tasks , requiring presidential permission to build a new church , and a governors permission to renovate even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislate from the bench . An example includes an Egyptian court 's refusal to grant Muslim Egyptians who convert to Christianity identity cards that display their new religion . According to Magdi Khalil , since Mubarak took office in 1981 , Copts have suffered over 1,500 attacks and have lost millions of dollars worth of property . After the ousting of Hosni Mubarak , violent incidents have continued . ' ' The Weekly Standard ' ' magazine has noted six cases of anti-Christian sentiment and violence by extremist Salafist groups , some of which have gone unpunished . On 7 May 2011 , a church was burnt down in Cairo . # Improvements and Positive Developments in Respect for Religious Freedom # According to the Minister for Awqaf , Hamdy Zaqzouq , in a December 2006 press statement , the Government has appointed 50 women to roles as preachers ( murshidat ) to address gatherings of Muslim women in mosques , for the first time in the country 's history . A Coptic Christian woman was among 30 women judges appointed to the bench in early April . Courts have normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damages due to sectarian-based violence . However , the Government took positive steps in response to an April 2006 sectarian attack in Alexandria that led to mob violence the following day resulting in injuries to Copts and the burning and looting of Christian-owned shops . A parliamentary inquiry investigated the incidents and in January 2007 a police military tribunal in Cairo convicted 5 of 10 accused police officers on charges of dereliction of duty for failing to appear at their respective duty stations . The court also ratified previous penalties imposed on a group of police captains by an internal police review board , ruling that the captains should be excluded from service in the future . The tribunal also dismissed one brigadier general from service on grounds that he was incapable of performing the duties assigned to him , and fined a colonel and a major $250 ( LE 1500 ) each . Final rulings had not been handed down against the remaining 5 officers by the end of the reporting period . During the reporting period Al-Azhar held a small number of interfaith discussions both inside the country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding Pope Benedict XVI 's comments on the Prophet Muhammad . The Grand Imam of Al-Azhar , Sheikh Tantawi , a government appointee , and Coptic Orthodox Pope Shenouda III , participated in joint public events during Ramadan and Easter and in a Christian-Muslim dialogue in June 2006 . In January 2007 the NCHR released its third annual report , in which it recommended a solution for official recognition of Baha'is , discussed the complaints of Jehovah 's Witnesses , and criticized both religious textbooks in schools and the curriculum taught in the Imams ' Institution affiliated with the Ministry of Higher Education for failing to address human rights topics . The report also encouraged the Government to pass a law for all religious groups addressing the construction of new places of worship . An Islamic-Christian conference on September 7 , 2006 , in Al-Alamein called for the urgent development of religious discourse in order to entrench nationalism and sense of belonging among all categories of the society . The meeting was organized by the Coptic Evangelical Organization for Social Services ( CEOSS ) and attended by Islamic and Christian scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures . The conference called for rallying efforts to disseminate the moderate religious trends of both Islam and Christianity . During the reporting period more than 170 political and human rights activists , Muslim and Christian intellectuals , and academics launched an initiative ( Egyptians Against Religious Discrimination ) to promote religious tolerance and combat discrimination against non-Muslims . The idea originated in April 2006 after the attacks on Alexandria churches . Their aim is to achieve equal treatment for all citizens and enhance freedom of religion . On March 5 , 2007 , the movement issued a statement criticizing security service refusal to allow them to hold meetings to discuss Article Two of the Constitution . # Societal abuses and discrimination # Christians and Muslims share a common culture and live as neighbors throughout the country . However , religious tensions exist and individual acts of prejudice and violence occur . On May 11 , 2007 , following Friday prayers in the village of Bamha , near Cairo , a group of Muslim citizens attacked Christian villagers , reportedly because they believed that the Christians were planning to build or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuing violence led to the arson or looting of 27 Christian-owned shops and homes , and injuries to 12 Christians , one seriously . Police responded quickly to contain the violence and detained approximately 60 mostly Muslim villagers . By the end of the reporting period , most detainees had been released , and the local authorities sought to arrange several reconciliation meetings in Bamha but had not pursued formal charges against those responsible for the violence . In Awlad Azaz village , Sohag governorate , Muslim and Christian villagers clashed on September 16 , 2006 , over 14.5 acres ( 14 feddans ) of land located outside the formal boundary fence of the Monastery of Saint Shenouda ( the White Monastery ) . Although Christians had traditionally claimed the land , local authorities designated a portion of it as a cemetery for Muslims in 2003 . After the monk who heads the monastery encouraged Christian villagers to cultivate the land , Muslim protestors used nearby mosque loudspeakers to call upon Muslims to defend the land against Christian encroachment . Despite the rapid deployment of security forces in the area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , members of Parliament , and local officials in the governorate worked quickly to resolve the problem . A SSIS official reportedly brokered a deal that resulted in the land being equally divided between Christians and Muslims . In a talk show aired by Dream TV in March 2007 , noted television personality Mona al-Shazli hosted Muslim judges Magdi al-Garhi and Noha al-Zeini , who expressed their personal objections to Christians being appointed as judges . They asserted that judges are ' patrons ' who are charged with authority and that Islam was explicit in rejecting the patronage of non-Muslims over Muslims . A number of Christian judges of the State Council , the highest administrative court in the country , held a meeting at the Egyptian Judges ' Club ( a professional association ) in which they demanded an apology from Garhi , with some demanding Garhi 's resignation as secretary of the club .

6339514 Libya **6;0;br Free Papua Movement ' ' Supported by : ' ' **6;8;br Muammar Gaddafi Jacob Prai The insurgency in Aceh was waged by the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) between 1976 and 2005 in order for the province to be independent from Indonesia . The Indonesian state had designated it as the Aceh Disturbance ( or ' ' Pemberontakan Aceh ' ' ) . Destruction caused by the armed conflicts and 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake brought a peace deal and an end to the insurgency . Amnesty International released the ' ' Time to Face the Past ' ' report in April 2013 following the failure of the Indonesian government to uphold its 2005 peace agreement obligations , and the report warns that further violence may ensue if the matter is not addressed . # Background # There is something of a cultural and religious difference between Aceh and much of the rest of Indonesia . A more conservative form of Islam than is mainstream in most of Indonesia is widely practiced in Aceh . The broadly secular policies of Suharto 's New Order regime ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central government 's policy of promoting a unified ' Indonesian culture ' . Further , not surprisingly given the location of the province at the northern end of Indonesia , there is a widespread feeling in the province that leaders in distant Jakarta do not understand Aceh 's problems and have little sympathy for local needs and customs in Aceh. # Timeline # # First phase # The centralist tendencies of the government of Suharto , along with other grievances , led Hasan di Tiro to form the Free Aceh Movement ( GAM ) on 4 December 1976 and declare Acehnese independence . The main perceived threats were to Acehnese religion and culture from the neo-colonial government and the rising numbers of Javanese migrants into Aceh . The perceived unfair distribution of income from Aceh 's substantial natural resources was another point of contention . GAM 's first operation in 1977 was carried out against Mobil Oil Indonesia which was the shareholder of PT Arun , the company which operated the Arun gas field . At this stage , the numbers mobilized by GAM were extremely limited . While there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cause , this did not translate into mass active participation . By di Tiro 's own account , only 70 men joined him and they came mostly from the district of Pidie and especially from di Tiro 's own villagewith some of them joining due to personal loyalties to the di Tiro family while others due to disillusionment with the central government . Many of GAM 's leaders were young and highly educated professionals who were members of the upper and middle classes of Acehnese society . GAM 's first cabinet , set up by di Tiro during his time in Aceh between 1976 and 1979 , composed of the following Darul Islam rebellion. : * Teungku Hasan di Tiro : ' ' Wali Negara ' ' , defense minister , and supreme commander * Dr. Muchtar Hasbi : vice-president ; minister of internal affairs * Tengku Muhamad Usman Lampoih Awe : minister of finance * Tengku Haji Iljas Leube : minister of justice * Dr. Husaini M. Hasan : minister of education and information * Dr. Zaini Abdullah : minister of health * Dr. Zubir Mahmud : minister of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works and industry * Amir Ishak : minister of communications * Amir Rashid Mahmud : minister of trade * Malik Mahmud : minister of state The mid-level and rank-and-file had fought in the 1953-59 Darul Islam rebellion . Many of them were older men who remained loyal to former Aceh military governor and leader of the Darul Islam rebellion in Aceh Daud Beureueh . The most prominent person of this group was Tengke Ilyas Leube , a well-known cleric who had been a leader of the Darul Islam rebellion . Some of the Darul Islam men were possibility linked to di Tiro through family or regional ties but they owed their loyalty primarily to Beureueh . These men provided the military know-how , local knowledge and logistical skills which the young educated leaders lacked . By the end of 1979 , Indonesian suppression actions had all but crushed GAMits leaders were either in exile , imprisoned , or killed ; its followers were dispersed and pushed underground . Leaders such as Di Tiro , Zaini Abdullah ( GAM minister of health ) , Malik Mahmud ( GAM minister of state ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education ) had fled overseas and the original GAM cabinet ceased to function . # Second phase # In 1985 , di Tiro secured Libyan support for GAMtaking advantage of Muammar Gaddafi 's policy of supporting nationalist rebellions through his Mathaba Against Imperialism , Racism , Zionism and Fascism . It was not clear if Libya had subsequently funded GAM but what it definitely provided was a sanctuary in which GAM recruits could receive much-needed military training . Accounts differ on the number of fighters trained by Libya during the period of 1986 to 1989 or 1990 . GAM recruiters claimed that there were around 1,000 to 2,000 while press reports drawing from Indonesian military 's report claimed that they numbered 600 to 800 . Among the GAM leaders who joined during this phase were Sofyan Dawood ( who would become GAM commander Pas , North Aceh ) and Ishak Daud ( who became the spokesman for GAM Peureulak , East Aceh ) . Incidents in the second phase began in 1989 after the return of the trainees from Libya . Operations by GAM included weapons raiding , attacks against police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and military personnel , government informants and other individuals . Although it failed to gain widespread support , the group 's actions led the Indonesian government to institute repressive measures . The period between 1989 and 1998 became known as the Military Operation Area or ' ' Daerah Operasi Militer ' ' ( DOM ) era as the Indonesian military stepped up its counter-insurgency measures . This measure , although tactically successful in destroying GAM as a guerilla force , alienated the local Acehnese which helped GAM re-establish itself when Indonesian military was almost totally withdrawn from Aceh by order of president Habibie in late-1998 . Important GAM commanders were either killed ( Pase district commander Yusuf Ali and senior GAM commander Keuchik Umar ) , captured ( Ligadinsyah Ibrahim ) or fled ( Robert , Arjuna and Daud Kandang ) . # Third phase # In 1999 , chaos in Java and an ineffective central government due to the fall of Suharto gave an advantage to Free Aceh Movement and resulted in the second phase of the rebellion , this time with large support from the Acehnese people . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security situation led to re-introduction of more soldiers and troop numbers were believed to have risen during President Megawati Sukarnoputri 's term in office ( 2001-2004 ) to around 15,000 by mid-2002 . GAM was able to control 70 percent of the countryside in all of Aceh . During this phase , there were two periods of brief cessation of hostilities : the Humanitarian Pause in 2000 and the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement ( COHA ) which lasted only between December 2002 when it was signed and ended in May 2003 when the Indonesian government declared a military emergency in Aceh and announced that it wanted to destroy GAM once and for all . In a break from its emphasis on military means of attaining independence , GAM shifted its position to one supporting the holding of a referendum . During the 8 November 1999 pro-referendum demonstrations in Banda Aceh , GAM gave support by providing transport to protesters from rural areas to the provincial capital . On 21 July 2002 , GAM also issued the Stavanger Declaration following a meeting of the Worldwide Achehnese Representatives Meeting in Stavanger , Norway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Acheh practices the system of democracy . Aspinall saw that these democratic and human rights impulses within GAM as an effect of the efforts of urban-based Acehnese group which were promoting such values in the freer and more open environment following the fall of Soeharto from power . Security crackdowns in 2001 and 2002 resulted in several thousand civilian deaths . Throughout the conflict an estimated 15,000 people have been killed . The government launched an offensive and a state of emergency was proclaimed in the Province . During this period , the GAM was severely disabled with its commander Abdullah Syafei killed in a government ambush in January 2002 , while various regional commanders such as Tengku Jamaica and Ishak Daud were also killed . By GAM 's own admission , it lost 50% of its strength during the government offensive of 2003-2005 . The insurgency was still going on when the Tsunami Disaster of 2004 struck the province . In November 2003 the martial law was extended for a further six months . According to a Human Rights Watch report , the Indonesian military committed widespread human rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 people being displaced in the first seven months of martial law and extrajudicial killings being common . # The peace agreement and first local elections # After the devastating tsunami in December 2004 , GAM declared a unilateral cease-fire , with members of the international community reiterating the need to resolve the conflict . Of the numerous accounts of the negotiation process , one from the Indonesian side is in the book by the Indonesian key negotiator , Hamid Awaludin . A differing account was written by GAM adviser , Damien Kingsbury : Peace in Aceh : A Personal Account of the Aceh Peace Process ' ' Despite GAM 's unilateral ceasefire , the TNI continued its assault on GAM personnel and positions . Because of the separatist movement in the area , the Indonesian government had access restrictions in place on the press and aid workers . After the tsunami , however , the Indonesian government opened the region up to international relief efforts . The tsunami drew international attention to the conflict . Earlier peace efforts had failed , but for a number of reasons , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict and , notably , a desire by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to secure peace in Indonesia , a peace agreement was reached in 2005 after 29 years of war . Post-Suharto Indonesia and the liberal-democratic reform period , as well as changes in the Indonesian military , helped create an environment more favorable to peace talks . The roles of newly elected President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Vice President Jusuf Kalla were highly significant . At the same time , the GAM leadership was reconsidering options available to it , and the Indonesian military had put the rebel movement under significant pressure that encouraged GAM to accept an outcome short of full independence . The peace talks were facilitated by a Finland-based NGO , the Crisis Management Initiative , and led by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari . The resulting peace agreement was signed on August 15 , 2005 . Under the agreement , Aceh would receive special autonomy under the Republic of Indonesia , and non-organic ( ie. non-Aceh native ) government troops would be withdrawn from the province ( leaving only 25,000 soldiers ) in exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European Union dispatched 300 monitors . Their mission expired on December 15 , 2006 , following local elections . Aceh has been granted broader autonomy through Aceh Government Legislation covering special rights agreed upon in 2002 as well as the right of the Acehnese to establish local political parties to represent their interests . However , Human rights advocates highlighted that previous human rights violations in the province would need to be addressed . During elections for the provincial governor held in December 2006 , the former GAM and national parties participated . The election was won by Irwandi Yusuf , whose base of support consists largely of ex-GAM members . # Possible causes of conflict # # Historical # The area first fell Dutch authority as a result of the Dutch expedition on the west coast of Sumatra of 1831 . Australian National University ( ANU ) academic Edward Aspinall argued that the historical experience of Aceh during the Indonesian National Revolution led to a path-dependent development for Acehnese separatism ie. past events lead to a narrowing of the possibilities for subsequent development . He argued : : Acehnese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be traced to particular historical events and conflicts of interest , notably the autonomy that the modernist ' ' ulama ' ' Muslim religious scholars enjoyed during the revolution and the dramatic loss of it immediately after . Aspinall argued further that there were two milestones for the path-dependent development of Aceh separatism : : 1945 49 : Aceh played an important role in the revolution and war of independence against the Dutch and consequently was allegedly able to extract a promise from then-President Soekarno during his 1947 visit to Aceh that it would be allowed to implement Islamic law ( or ' ' syariah ' ' ) following independence . : 1953 62 : Aceh military governor Daud Beureueh declared that the province would secede from Republik Indonesia ( RI ) to join the Negara Islam Indonesia ( NII ) in reaction to the refusal of the central government to allow the implementation of ' ' syariah ' ' and the downgrading of Aceh from the status of a province . This rebellion which Aceh was a part of came to be known as the Darul Islam Rebellion . Aspinall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Acehnese identification with a pan-Indonesian/Islamic cause and laid the groundwork for particularism . The above argument by Aspinall contradicted the views of earlier scholars . Earlier in 1998 , Geoffrey Robinson argued that the 1962 defeat and surrender of the Daud Beureueh-led rebellion was followed by roughly 15 years in which Aceh presented no particular security or political problem to the central government . Tim Kell also pointed out that the former leaders of the 1953-62 rebellion had keenly joined the Indonesian armed forces in the crackdown against the Partai Komunis Indonesia ( PKI ) in 1965 and 1966. # Religion # Aceh like most of Indonesia , had Muslims as the majority religious group . However , it is generally acknowledged that it was the region where Islam first entered into the Malay archipelago . The first known Islamic kingdom was Pasai ( near present-day Lhokseumawe in northern Aceh ) which dates back to the mid-13th century . The earliest found archaeological evidence to support this view was the tomb stone of Sultan Malik ul Salih who died in 1297 . In the centuries that followed , Pasai became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Islamic governance in which other Islamic kingdoms look to for guidance . Part of the distinct Acehnese identity would stem from its status as the earliest Islamic region and the exemplar for the rest of the Malay archipelago . This separateness from the rest of Indonesia where Islam is concerned could be observed from the formation of the ' ' Persatuan Ulama Seluruh Aceh ' ' ( PUSA ) in 1939 by modernist Islamic scholars ( or ' ' ulama ' ' ) . The organisation was exclusively Acehnese . It was noted that in Aceh itself , most pan-Indonesian mass organisations had been weakeven the Muhammadiyah , the main organisation for modernist-oriented Muslims in Indonesia failed to make inroads in Aceh beyond urban areas and was largely non-Acehnese in its membership . However , it was also noted that though PUSA was parochial in its orientation , it nonetheless still identified with a pan-Islamic cause where the goal was for all Muslims to be united under the ' ' syariah ' ' . Another factor of the religious cause for Aceh 's separatism was the treatment of Muslim groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Orde Baru ' ' regime . First , there was the forced fusion of all political parties representing Muslim interests into the ' ' Partai Persatuan Pembangunan ' ' ( PPP ) or United Development Party in 1973 . Members and followers of Islamic political parties in Aceh suffered from varying degrees of harassment . Despite Aceh 's special territory status , it was not allowed to implement ' ' syariah ' ' nor to integrate Islamic religious schools ( ' ' madrasah ' ' ) with mainstream national schools for a unified education systemboth proposals were ignored by the central government . Despite Indonesia being a Muslim majority state , building on Aceh 's existing self-conception of its role in Islam and the ' ' Orde Baru s hostile attitude towards Islamic forms of societal influence , GAM was able to frame the struggle against the Indonesian government as a ' ' prang sabi ' ' ( holy war ) in much the same way the term was used in the Infidel War ( or Aceh War ) against the Dutch from 1873 to 1913 . An indication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hikayat Prang Sabi ' ' ( Tales of Holy War ) , a collection of tales used to inspire resistance against the Dutch , by some elements of GAM as propaganda against the Indonesian government . Before the second wave of insurrections by GAM in the late-1980s , it was observed that some individuals had forced Acehnese school children to sing the ' ' Hikayat Prang Sabi ' ' instead of Indonesia 's national anthem , ' ' Indonesia Raya ' ' . GAM political publicity material also painted the official state ideology of ' ' Pancasila ' ' as a polytheistic teaching . Notwithstanding the above , it was observed that in the aftermath of the fall of Soeharto in 1998 , religion as a factor for Aceh separatism began to subside even if there had been a proliferation of Muslim student unions and other groups in Aceh . It was noted that these newly-emerged groups rarely called for the implementation of ' ' syariah ' ' in Aceh . Instead , they emphasized the need for a referendum on Aceh 's independence and highlighted the human rights abuses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , GAM 's position on ' ' syariah ' ' also shifted . When the central government passed the Law No. 44/1999 on Aceh Autonomy which included provisions for the implementation of ' ' syariah ' ' , GAM condemned the move as irrelevant and a possible attempt to deceive Acehnese and or portray them to the outside world as religious fanatics . Despite the official stance on ' ' syariah ' ' , GAM 's position was not a clear cut one . It was noted by the International Crisis Group ( ICG ) that between 1999 and 2001 , there were periodic instances of some GAM local military commanders enforcing ' ' syariah ' ' in communities where they had influence in . Aspinall also observed that overall , the evolution of GAM 's position vis-a-via ' ' syariah ' ' and Islam was dependent on the international environment and which countries it targeted for support in its cause for independence -- ie. if western countries were deemed important , Islam was de-emphasized and if Muslim countries were deemed important , Islam would be emphasized . # Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to the revenues derived from the oil and gas industries in Aceh . Robinson argued that the ' ' Orde Baru s management and exploitation of Aceh 's resources and the way it distributed the benefits was the root cause of the insurgency . From the 1970s to the mid-1980s , Aceh had undergone a LNG boom following the discovery natural gas on the northeast coast of Aceh . Over the same period , Aceh became a major source of revenue for the central government and in the 1980s , it contributed significantly to Indonesia 's exports when it became the third largest source of exports after the provinces of East Kalimantan and Riau . Despite this , practically all oil and gas revenues from production and exports activities in Aceh was appropriated by the central government either directly or through production sharing agreements with state oil company Pertamina . Furthermore , the central government did not re-invest a fair amount of the revenues back into the province . This led some of Aceh 's then-emerging technocratic class to lament that the province had been denied its fair share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ignored peripheral region . Robinson noted that though some of Aceh 's small but burgeoning business class had benefited from the influx of foreign capital during the LNG boom , there were many who felt aggrieved at losing out to others with good political connections to the central governmentmost notably , the leader of GAM himself , Hasan di Tiro was one such aggrieved party when he made a bid for an oil pipeline contract for Mobile Oil Indonesia in 1974 but lost out to a US company . He further noted that the timing of GAM 's declaration of independence in December 1976 and its first military action in 1977 happened at roughly the same time that Aceh 's first natural gas extraction and processing facility had opened . Indeed , in GAM 's declaration of independence , the following claim was made : : Acheh , Sumatra has been producing a revenue of over 15 billion US dollars yearly for the Javanese neocolonialists , which they used totally for the benefit of Java and the Javanese . Despite the above , Robinson noted that while this factor partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not appear to explain the re-emergence of GAM in 1989 and the never-before seen levels of violence thereafter . Aspinall supports this viewpoint and argued that though resource and economic grievances should not be discounted , they were not decisive as the provinces of Riau and East Kalimantan both faced similar or even harsher exploitation by the central government but no separatist rebellions took place in those two provinces due to the difference in political conditions . He furthered that the resource-based grievance was a means for GAM to convince Acehnese that they should abandon hopes of special treatment and autonomy within Indonesia and instead work for the restoration of Aceh 's glory by seeking independence . # Role of GAM in galvanizing grievances # GAM 's founder Hasan di Tiro and his fellow leaders in exile in Sweden were instrumental in providing a coherent message on both the necessity and right of self-determination for Aceh . Accordingly , arguments on the need for independence was targeted at the domestic Acehnese audience while the right to independence was targeted at the international audience to win diplomatic support . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ' ' bona fide ' ' sovereign actor on the international stage with emphasis on the sultanate 's past relations with European states - diplomatic missions , treaties as well as statements of recognition of Aceh 's sovereignty . In accordance to this logic , an independent Aceh ( as represented by GAM ) would be the successor state to the Aceh Sultanate before defeat by the Dutch following the Aceh War ( 1873-1913 ) . The Aceh War was thus seen as an unlawful act of aggression by the Dutch and the subsequent incorporation of Aceh into Indonesia in 1949 was casted as an extension of the unlawful occupation by the Dutch . This argument targeted at both the Acehnese themselves as well as the international communityie. through its appeal to international law . In the same vein , the state of Indonesia was cast by GAM propaganda as a cover for Javanese domination . In di Tiro 's own description : : Indonesia was a fraud . A cloak to cover up Javanese colonialism . Since the world begun sic , there never was a people , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by that name . The efforts at spreading GAM propaganda relied much on word of mouth . Elizabeth Drexler had observed that ordinary Acehnese and GAM supporters often repeat the same claims made in GAM 's propaganda which they had came into contact with through this mode of dissemination . The late M. Isa Sulaiman wrote that when di Tiro first started his secessionist activities between 1974 and 1976 , he had relied on a network of relatives and a number of like-minded young intellectuals to spread his messagewhich gained traction especially in Medan , North Sumatra . Aspinall also wrote of GAM sympathizers ' recollection of the early days of the insurrection in which they would pass pamphlets to friends or slide them anonymously under the doors of their colleagues ' offices . The results of the propaganda efforts were however quite mixed . Eric Morris when interviewing GAM supporters for his 1983 thesis noted that , rather than independence , they were more interested in either an Indonesian Islamic state or for Aceh to be treated more fairly by the central government . Aspinall also noted that for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the United Development Party which was campaigning on an Islamic platform for the Indonesian legislative election in 1977 . For individuals who had become core supporters however , the message of independence found in GAM 's propaganda was seen as revelatory and many saw felt a moment of awakening . # Possible factors for prolonged conflict # # Resilience of GAM 's network # Many of the participants of GAM were either participants of the Darul Islam rebellion or were the sons of those who had . Aspinall noted that the kinship ties , between father and son as well as amongst brothers , had been crucial to GAM 's solidarity as an organisation . Many felt that they were continuing the aspirations of either their fathers , uncles , brothers or male cousin who were usually the ones who inducted them into the organizationor whose exploits or deaths at the hands of the state security apparatus had inspired them to join . GAM 's constituents were also often residents in close-knit rural communities where everybody knew their neighbors well . These features enabled both continuity as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aspinall also credited GAM 's resilience on the cell-like structure at the lower levels . At the levels below the regional military commander ( ' ' panglima wilayah ' ' ) were units commanded by junior commanders ( ' ' panglima muda ' ' ) and even lower level commanders ( ' ' panglima sagoe ' ' and ' ' ulee sagoe ' ' ) who did not know the identities of their counterparts in neighboring regions and only knew those directly above them . These allowed GAM to survive as an organization despite the suppression efforts of the Indonesian state . # Human rights abuses by Indonesian military # Robinson argued that the institutionalized use of terror by the Indonesian military in counter-insurgency action against GAM under the late- ' ' Orde Baru ' ' period from the middle of 1990 ( ie. in the second phase of the insurrection ) had led to a wider section of Acehnese being affected and pushed them to be more sympathetic and supportive of GAM . He assessed that such methods had the effect of escalating the level of violence , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved difficult to heal . As Amnesty International noted : : The political authority of the armed forces , considerable even under normal conditions , now became unchallengeable . In the name of national security , military and police authorities deployed in Aceh were thereafter free to use virtually any means deemed necessary to destroy the GPK ( ' ' Gerakan Pengacauan Keamanan ' ' or Security Disturbance Movement , which was the Indonesian government 's nomenclature for GAM ) . Amnesty International documented the use of arbitrary arrests , extra-legal detention , summary executions , rape and scorch-earth as features of the Indonesian military 's push against GAM since 1990 . Among the more chilling acts observed by Amnesty International was the public disposal of the bodies of victims of summary executions or ' ' Petrus Killings ' ' ( ' ' Penembakan Misterius ' ' ) to serve as warnings to Acehnese to refrain from joining or supporting GAM . The following was Amnesty International 's description of such acts : : The mysterious killings ( ' ' Petrus ' ' ) in Aceh had the following general features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places - beside a main road , in fields and plantations , next to a stream or a river - apparently as a warning to others not to join or support the rebels . Most had clearly been prisoners when they were killed , their thumbs , and sometimes their feet , had been tied together with a particular type of knot . Most had been shot at close range , though the bullets were seldom found in their bodies . Most also showed signs of having been beaten with a blunt instrument or tortured , and their faces were therefore often unrecognizable . For the most part , the bodies were not recovered by relatives or friends , both out of fear of retribution by the military and because the victims were usually dumped at some distance from their home villages . Another questionable tactic of the TNI was the so-called ' ' civil-military operations in which civilians were compelled to participate in intelligence and security operations . A notorious example of this was the ' ' Operasi Pagar Betis ' ' ( or Fence of Legs ) as described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil-military cooperation was the fence of legs operation - used previously in East Timor - in which ordinary villagers were compelled to sweep through an area ahead of armed troops , in order both to flush out rebels and to inhibit them from returning fire . Essential to the success of these operations were local vigilante groups and night patrols made up of civilians but established under military order and supervision . Between 20 and 30 young men were mobilized from each village in suspected rebel areas . In the words of a local military commander : The youths are the front line . They know best who the GPK are . We then settle the matter . Refusal to participate in these groups - or failure to demonstrate sufficient commitment to crushing the enemy by identifying , capturing or killing alleged rebels - sometimes resulted in punishment by government forces , including public torture , arrest and execution . # Indonesian military 's interests in Aceh # Damien Kingsbury , who served as adviser to the GAM leadership in Stockholm and Helsinki during the Helsinki peace talks in 2005 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict at a level which would justify their presence in the restive province . The ICG also asserted in a 2003 report that , Aceh is simply too lucrative a place for military officers who rely so heavily on non-budgetary sources of income . Kingsbury and Lesley McCulloch outlined the following business activities allegedly conducted by the Indonesian military in Aceh : * Drugs : Security forces encouraged local farmers to grow marijuana and paid them prices far below the black market value . One instance highlighted was a police helicopter pilot admitting after his arrest that he was flying a 40 kg consignment of the drug for his superior the police chief of Aceh Besar ( note that at this point the Indonesian Police or Polri was under the command of the military ) . Another case was in September 2002 in which an army truck was intercepted by the police in Binjai , North Sumatra with a cargo of 1,350 kg of marijuana . * Illegal arms sale : Interviews in 2001 and 2002 with GAM leaders in Aceh revealed that some of their weapons were in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales was for the Indonesian military personnel to report those weapons sold as having been seized during combat . Secondly , key Indonesian military personnel with access had even directly provided GAM with a reliable supply of weapons as well as ammunition . * Illegal/unlicensed logging : Military and police were paid by logging companies to ignore logging activities which took place outside of licensed areas . The Leuser Development Project funded by the European Union from the mid-1990s to combat illegal logging had in fact discovered that the Indonesian military and police who were supposed to assist in preventing illegal logging were in fact facilitating and , in some cases , even initiating such illegal activities . * Protection : The military ran protection rackets to extract payments from companies such as Mobil and PT Arun in the oil and gas industries as well as companies operating plantations in Aceh . In return for the payments , the military would deploy its personnel at the properties and areas of operations of these companies . * Fishery : Local fisherman were forced to sell to the military their catches at prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell the fishes to local businesses at a much higher prices . Personnel of the Indonesian Navy might also waylay fishing vessels to extort payments from fishermen . * Coffee : Similar to fishermen , coffee planters were compelled to sell coffee beans to the military at low prices . # Possible factors for peaceful resolution # # Weakening of GAM 's military position # The declaration of martial law by the Indonesian government in May 2003 had resulted in a concerted push by the Indonesian military against GAM . The ICG reported that by mid-2004 , GAM 's supply lines and communications had been seriously disrupted . It was also more difficult for them to move about , and their presence in urban areas was largely rooted out . As a result , GAM 's command in Pidie had instructed all field commanders by telephone to pull back from the ' ' sagoe ' ' ( sub-district ) to the ' ' daerah ' ' ( district ) base and that henceforth military actions could only be undertaken on the order of the ' ' daerah ' ' commander and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( regional ) commander . Previously , when GAM was in a stronger position , its sagoe level units could exercise a great level of command autonomy to initiate military actions on their own . According to then Indonesian Armed Forces Commander General Endriartono Sutarto , the security forces succeeded in cutting the size of GAM 's forces by 9,593which presumably included surrenders , captures , and deaths . While doubting that the figure was accurate , most observers would agree that the renewed military push against GAM following the martial law declaration had dealt substantial damage to GAM . However , Aspinall noted that most GAM leaders whom he had interviewed , particularly the field officers , were adamant that their acceptance of the Helsinki MoU was not due to their military weakness . Former-GAM leader Irwandi Yusuf , who would go on to be the governor of Aceh through its inaugural direct gubernatorial elections on 11 Dec 2006 , ventured that far from collapsing , the situation of GAM was actually improving as the sick and infirm were captured by the Indonesian military which left those still in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commitment of GAM forces to fight on , GAM 's leaders might have , at that point , given up hope that a military victory over the government forces would be possible . In the words of former GAM prime minister Malik Mahmud to Aspinall in October 2005 : The existing strategies applied by both parties had caused a costly stalemate . When asked by Jakarta Post to comment on whether accepting the Helsinki MoU was a face-saving measure by GAM in the face of military setbacks , Malik said : : Well , we have to be realistic . We have to take into account the reality on the ground . If that peace agreement is a solution that 's good for both parties , of course with dignity on both sides , why not ! This is for the sake of peace , for the sake of future progress . So , there is nothing wrong with that and I think any other country in the world would do the same thing . And also when we come to that kind of situation we have to be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is what we did . # International pressure # The international opinion following the tsunami could also had a bearing on the importance placed on the Helsinki peace talks undertaken by both the Indonesian government and GAM . Both sides had sent senior ranking officials as negotiators while during the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement ( CoHA ) talks which was signed in December 2002 , representation was at a relatively junior level . GAM leaders had also assessed that during the Helsinki peace talks that there was no support from the international community for Aceh 's independence aspiration . With regard to this , Malik said : : We saw also that the world kept silent about our move for independence , so we thought during the process of negotiations that that autonomy and self-government was the best solution that was in front of us . In explaining to the GAM commanders the acceptance of self-government instead of continuing to struggle for independence , GAM leaders stressed that if they continued to insist on fighting for independence even after the 2004 tsunami , they would risk being isolated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 2004 , President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ( SBY ) and Vice President Jusuf Kalla were sworn in following the first ever direct presidential elections in 2004 . Aspinall argued that before this , there was a balance between those in the Indonesian government who believed that a military victory was impossible and that negotiations were needed and hardliners who held on to the view that GAM could be entirely eliminatedthe election of SBY and Kalla had tipped the balance in favor of the former position . He pointed out that while SBY was still a minister in the Cabinet of President Megawati Soekarnoputri , he had supported an integrated approach in which military measures were accompanied by efforts to negotiate with GAM . Kalla , then a ministerial colleague of SBY 's , also supported the re-starting of talks with GAM in early-2004 ( ie. a time when the martial law in Aceh was still in effect and the military operations was in full swing ) . During this time , Kalla , through his trusted intermediaries , made approaches to GAM 's commanders in the field as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president and vice president of Indonesia in favor of negotiations as a solution to the Aceh insurgency thus provided a platform for the eventual success of the Helsinki peace talks . Kingsbury , an official advisor to GAM , also credited the election of SBY and Kalla in 2004 as the impetus for the peace efforts which led to the eventual agreement . In particular , he credited the appointment of Kalla for overseeing the Indonesian delegation for the peace talks as crucial because Kalla 's status as the general chairman of Golkar , at that time the largest party in the Indonesian legislature , allowed SBY 's government to deal effectively with any opposition coming from the parliament . # ' ' Time To Face The Past ' ' report # In April 2013 , Amnesty International released the ' ' Time To Face The Past ' ' report in which the organisation states that most victims and their relatives have long been denied truth , justice and reparation in violation of Indonesias obligation under international law . They are still waiting for local and national Indonesian authorities to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the conflict . For the formulation of the report , Amnesty International employed the findings that it collected during a visit to Aceh in May 2012during this visit , organisational representatives spoke with non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , community organisations , lawyers , parliamentarians , local government officials , journalists , and victims and their representatives about the situation in Aceh at the time of the interviews . While victims expressed their appreciation of the peace process and the increased security in the Aceh province , they conveyed their frustration at the lack of action from the Indonesian government in regard to the 2005 memorandum of understanding ( MOU ) , in which a plan for the setting up of a Human Rights Court for Aceh and an Aceh Truth and Reconciliation Commission is documented . Moreover , the ' ' Time To Face The Past ' ' report contains a warning in light of the potential for renewed violence that exists in Aceh if the Indonesian government remains stagnant in relation to its commitments from the 2005 MOU . Amnesty International 's deputy Asia Pacific director Isabelle Arradon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is breeding resentment that could sow the seeds of a future return to violence . As of April 19 , 2013 , the Indonesian government had not issued a response to the report and a presidential spokesman informed the BBC news service that he was unable to comment as he had not read the report . # See also # *2004 Indian Ocean earthquake *Bambang Darmono *The Black Road # References 
6350514 widthimperial= ' ' The Old Plantation ' ' is an American folk art watercolor likely painted in the late 18th century on a South Carolina plantation . It is notable for its early date , its credible , non-stereotypical depiction of slaves on the North American mainland , and the fact that the slaves are shown pursuing their own interests . The artist has been identified as South Carolina slaveholder John Rose , and the painting may depict his plantation in what is now Beaufort County . # Description and interpretation # The painting depicts African American slaves between two small outbuildings of a plantation sited on a broad river . ' ' The Old Plantation ' ' is the only known painting of its era that depicts African Americans by themselves , concerned only with each other , though its central activity remains obscure . Some writers have speculated that the painting depicts a marriage ceremony , with the attendant tradition of jumping the broom . However , scholars have suggested that the subjects are performing a secular dance : western African dance patterns traditionally include sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of West African origin . The painting features two male musicians , one of whom is playing a stringed instrument that resembles a Yoruba molo ; the body of this instrument seems to be a hollow gourd . The molo is a precursor to the banjo , and this is the earliest known American painting to picture a banjo-like instrument . The second musician is playing a percussion instrument that may be a Yoruba gudugudu . The two women hold what look like scarves , but are actually sheguras , rattles made of a gourd enclosed in a net of variable length into which hard objects have been woven . # Artist and provenance # For decades the identity of the artist was unknown , as was the painting 's provenance prior to 1935 , when it was purchased by Holger Cahill from Mary E. Lyles of Columbia , South Carolina . However , in 2010 , Susan P. Shames , a librarian at Colonial Williamsburg , published a book titled ' ' The Old Plantation : The Artist Revealed ' ' in which she argues the artist was South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image depicts slaves on Rose 's plantation in what is now Beaufort County , South Carolina , or one nearby . In 1775 , Rose was named Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas in Beaufort District , an appointment implying his educated status and familiarity with governing officials . By 1795 , he owned a lot in the town of Beaufort , as well as a rural , 813-acre tract on the Coosaw River in Prince William Parish . He employed slave labor to farm the latter property . At least fifty of these slaves have been identified by name , and he likely he owned others . Shames suggests the slaves and plantation depicted in the image were Rose 's own . However , the broad river in the middle ground raises questions about whether Rose owned property on both sides of this natural boundary and , thus , whether he depicted his own dwelling and outbuildings in the background , or a neighbor 's . Rose moved to the Dorchester area in present-day Colleton County in 1795 , and he died in 1820 in Charleston after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his watercolor of dancing slaves to his son-in-law , Thomas Davis Stall ( 17701848 ) . According to Shames , it remained in the family for more than a hundred years , until it was finally sold at an auction of the estate of Rose Rowan Ellis Copes ( 18461927 ) of Orangeburg , South Carolina , probably in 1928 or 1929 . It was bought either by an unidentified interim dealer or by Mary Earle Lyles ( b. 1878 ) of Columbia . It was certainly in Lyles ' possession by 1935 , when it was purchased by Holger Cahill , acting as agent for Abby Aldrich Rockefeller . According to Lyles , however , it was painted on a plantation between Charleston and Orangeburg . A watermark on the paper has been identified as that used by the English papermaker James Whatman II ( 17411798 ) between 1777 and 1794 .

6449514 Infobox ship image ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' was a three-masted iron sailing ship ( clipper ) that operated between Great Britain and Australia between the late 19th century and 1905 . The name was drawn from Loch Venachar , a lake which lies to the south-west of the burgh of Callander , in the Stirling region of Scotland . It is understood to mean most beautiful lady in Scottish Gaelic . In September 1905 , she sank without trace and with all hands , leaving a spray of wreckage scattered along the south coast of Kangaroo Island . In 1976 , her extensively damaged remains were discovered in an average depth of 12 metres ( 40 ft ) of water near West Bay , Kangaroo Island in South Australia ( SA ) by the Society for Underwater Historical Research ( SUHR ) . # History and description # ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' was built in 1875 by Thomson 's on the Clyde for the Glasgow Shipping Company . She was one of a fleet of iron wool clippers of the well-known Loch Line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1,485 tons net ; length , 250 feet 1 inch ; breadth , 38 feet 3 inches ; depth of hold , 22 feet 4 inches . Her usual cargo was usually about 5,500 bales of wool . She was first rigged with fidded royal masts , but this proved to interfere with her stability as there was too much weight aloft . She was then given topgallant and royal masts in one with crossed royal yards over double-topgallants . ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' was always in the wool trade to Adelaide and Melbourne , but when an out wool clipper , she also carried passengers and other cargo . On her maiden voyage , she was commanded by Captain Francis Wagstaff , leaving Inishtrahull on 6 September 1875 . In early 1876 , Wagstaff was replaced by Captain William Robertson , who died in 1878 after only making two voyages on the vessel . The command was then given to her first officer , James S. Ozanne , but in 1884 , Captain Ozanne handed over command to Captain William H. Bennett . Following Bennett 's retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her final voyage in 1905 . ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' was considered an unlucky ship narrowly surviving a cyclone in the Indian Ocean in June 1892 . Around 8 pm on 3 June , the barometer began to fall ominously and the sail was promptly shortened . At approximately 5.00 am as darkness lifted it showed terrific head seas that swept down upon the vessel , lashed by the North-East gale . Two large waves approached the ship . ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' rode the first wave and sank into the trough at the other side . While in this position , the second wave came on and broke on deck with such force that it broke the foremast , mainmast and the mizzen topmast . Without her masts to steady her , the ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' rolled dangerously in heavy seas . After 9 days , the weather eased and the crew were able to rig a spar forward and sail on the damaged mizzen . After 5 weeks of sailing , she arrived at Port Louis , Mauritius . Although her stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , repairs only took 10 days to complete . Captain Bennett was awarded the Lloyd 's Medal for his leadership and bravery at sea . ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' suffered another serious accident on 12 November 1901 , after a collision with the ' ' SS Cato ' ' , in the Thames Estuary . After arriving in the Thames , she anchored off the Mucking Light . Just before dawn , she was cut down and holed on the starboard bow by ' ' Cato ' ' , with one hand being seriously injured . She rapidly sank in 40 feet of water , but all hands , along with the parrot and cat , got clear safely . She rested on the bottom of the Thames for a month before being raised and repaired at considerable cost , and again put back into service in the Adelaide and Melbourne trade . Despite her unlucky reputation , she sailed between Great Britain and Australia for 30 years without further incident , until her final voyage . # Final voyage # Under the command of Captain W.S. Hawkins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 1905 on a routine voyage to Adelaide . She was laden with general cargo including a consignment of 20,000 bricks . On 6 September 1905 , ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' was overtaken by SS ' ' Yongala ' ' about 160 miles west of the Neptune Islands and the captains exchanged all 's well signals . The Captain of the ' ' Yongala ' ' recorded that ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' presented a pretty sight with her sails in full standing , she sped along with every apparent prospect of reaching her port safely . It was the last known sighting of ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' . On 29 September , the ketch ' ' Annie Watt ' ' arrived in Adelaide and her captain reported picking up a reel of blue printing paper 18 miles North-West of Kangaroo Island . The paper was identified as part of ' ' Loch Vennachar 's ' ' cargo . Three weeks later , the sea began delivering scraps of her cargo to the jagged coast of Kangaroo Island which confirmed the disaster . The steamer ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions to search for the wreck and any survivors . Weeks of searching by government and local fishing boats produced only flotsam and the body of a young seaman , who was never identified . He was buried in the sand hills of West Bay . The search was eventually abandoned on 12 October . At the time , it was incorrectly concluded that ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' was wrecked on Young Rocks , a granite outcrop about 20 miles S.S.W. of Cape Gantheaume , trying to make the Backstairs Passage . # Crew of the final voyage # The first list of persons likely to be on the ship at the time of her loss appeared in the news media in late September 1905 . This list which contained 23 names of individuals who could be either crew or passengers was compiled from letters waiting for collection by the ship at the offices of George Wills &amp; Co. , the ship 's agent in Adelaide . A subsequent newspaper article advised that apprentices S.C . Brown and Robert Andrews had respectively transferred from Loch Vennachar to ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' despite their names being included on the previously published list . In late November 1905 , the following list was published in a number of newspapers in Australia and in papers in both New Zealand and Scotland .

The passing of Thomas Pearce received attention in the Australian press due to his father , Tom Pearce , being well known as one of the two survivors of the ' ' Loch Ard ' ' wrecking in 1878 , and as his grandfather , James Pearce , was the captain of SS ' ' Gothenburg ' ' at the time of her loss in 1875. # Aftermath # The loss of both ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' and ' ' Loch Sloy ' ' convinced the Marine Board of South Australia to argue for the bringing forward of a plan that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Couedic . Its view was that the loss of both ships could have been avoided if a lighthouse had been operating at Cape du Couedic . Construction commenced in 1907 and the light was officially lit on 27 June 1909 . The northern headland of West Bay was named Vennachar Point in the memory of the ship in 1908. # Discovery of the wreck site # In February 1976 , the SUHR conducted a search for the wreck along the west coast of Kangaroo Island . On 24 February , as conditions were unsuitable for underwater searching , a terrestrial search was conducted along the base of the 30 m ( 100 ft ) high cliffs immediately north of West Bay . During this search , a brick with the letters ' ' GLASOW ' ' on one of its faces was found . When conditions had improved on 26 February , SUHR divers Brian Marfleet , Doug Seton and Terry Smith joined by Kangaroo Island divers Chris and Robert Beckwith climbed down the cliff to enter the water at the location where the brick was found and later found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wreck site revealed that all of the anchors were still in place on the ship suggesting that no attempt had been made to prevent the ship 's collision with the cliff . After the discovery , the SUHR resolved to return to carry out a more comprehensive study of the wreck site . Between January and May 2011 , South Australian diver Steve ' Savy ' Saville discovered significant wreckage North of the SUHR find . In May 2011 Steve Saville , along with Luke Baade videoed and photographed the new find , and as well , parts of the SUHR discovery . # The ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' Expedition # After lobbying by the SUHR , the SA Premier , Don Dunstan , announced on 11 December 1976 that the SUHR would be mounting an expedition in February 1977 to study the site and that the government will providing the following support deployment of 10 police divers , special leave for government employees involved with the expedition and concessional fares on the government-owned ferry , ' ' MV Troubridge ' ' . Dunstan also announced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic reserve under the SA ' ' Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act 1965 ' ' . In February 1977 , a party of 34 people arrived in 2 major movements at a camp site set up at West Bay for a stay of 2 weeks . Due to unsuitable diving conditions , the first week was spent diving the ' ' Fides ' ' shipwreck on the north coast of Kangaroo Island . The second week was spent at the ' ' Loch Vennachar ' ' wreck site where the SUHR was able to achieve the following outcomes the location of the wreck site in respect to the land , a survey of the wreck 's bow section including locating the major anchors , completion of a photographic site record and recovery of a selection of artefacts for conservation . The expedition was funded by member contributions along with the donation of services , goods and cash from 4 government agencies , 35 private businesses and numerous individuals . In 1979 , as recommended in the Expedition 's report , the opportunity to conserve one of the bower anchors was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the SA Government and the Kangaroo Island Scuba Club to carry out the recovery . Assistance to the project was also provided by another 23 government agencies , private organisations and individuals . On 31 March 1980 , an anchor shank was recovered from the wreck site followed by its stock on 1 April . Both parts were temporarily stored in the waters of West Bay for eventual collection and transfer by the fishing vessel , ' ' Lady Buick ' ' , to Kingscote respectively during April and May 1980 . The shank and the stock were then respectively conveyed to Port Adelaide on ' ' MV Troubridge ' ' and on HMAS ' ' Banks ' ' . Conservation was carried out by Amdel in Adelaide . The conserved anchor was returned to Kangaroo Island where it was placed on display at the Flinders Chase Homestead in the Flinders Chase National Park , following a formal ceremony on 26 March 1982 attended by David Wotton , the SA Minister of Environment and Planning . # Present day # The wreck site has been protected by the Commonwealth ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it replaced the statutory protection provided by the SA ' ' Aboriginal and Historic Relics Preservation Act 1965 ' ' .

6465514 Splines are ridges or teethcite web on a drive shaft that mesh with grooves in a mating piece and transfer torque to it , maintaining the angular correspondence between them . For instance , a gear mounted on a shaft might use a male spline on the shaft that matches the female spline on the gear . The splines on the pictured drive shaft match with the female splines in the center of the clutch plate , while the smooth tip of the axle is supported in the pilot bearing in the flywheel . An alternative to splines is a keyway and key , though splines provide a longer fatigue life . # Types # There are several types of splines : ; Parallel key spline : where the sides of the equally spaced grooves are parallel in both directions , radial and axial . ; Involute spline : where the sides of the equally spaced grooves are involute , as with an involute gear , but not as tall . The curves increase strength by decreasing stress concentrations . ; Crowned splines : where the sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male teeth are modified to allow for misalignment . ; Serrations : where the sides of the equally spaced grooves form a V . These are used on small-diameter shafts . ; Helical splines : where the equally spaced grooves form a helix about the shaft . The sides may be parallel or involute . This can either minimize stress concentrations for a stationary joint under high load , or allow for rotary and linear motion between the parts . ; Ball splines : where the ' teeth ' of the outer part are implemented with a ball bearing to allow for free linear motion even under high torque . # Uses # Drive shafts on vehicles and power take-offs use splines to transmit torque and rotation and allow for changes in length . Splines are used in several places on bicycles . The crank arm to BB shaft interfaces that are splined include ISIS Drive , Truvativ GXP and Howitzer , Shimano 's Octalink and many others , most of which are proprietary . Some cranksets feature modular spiders , where torque is transmitted through splines . Cassettes engage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others to enforce a fixed orientation . Disc brake mounting interfaces that are splined include Centerlock , by Shimano . Aircraft engines may have a spline upon which mounts the propeller . There may be a master spline which is wider than the others , so that the propeller may go on at only one orientation , to maintain dynamic balance . This arrangement is commonly found in larger engines , whereas smaller engines typically use a pattern of threaded fasteners instead . # Manufacturing # There are two types of splines , internal and external .

6693514 Got Mercury ? is a public awareness campaign about mercury levels in seafood . It is sponsored by the Sea Turtle Restoration Project ( STRP ) and its parent organization , the Turtle Island Restoration Network ( TIRN ) . The name of the campaign is a snowclone of the successful Got Milk ? advertising campaign . # History # Although STRP was founded to protect sea turtles in their natural habitats , the organization began the Got Mercury ? campaign in 2002 . The campaign advocates that supermarkets and restaurants post warning signs about mercury contamination in seafood , require them to regularly screen seafood for levels of mercury under one part per million and that species that contain the highest levels of mercury should be removed from the shelves . In 2004 , the organization created an online mercury seafood calculator , one that was mimicked by the free market Center for Consumer Freedom not long thereafter . On March 17 , 2008 , Got Mercury ? issued a report entitled , ' ' Mercury in Seafood : No Fair Warning ' ' , which included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuna tested from California markets often exceeded the FDA limit of 1ppm. * Several California restaurant chains were chronically out of compliance with California Proposition 65 which requires restaurants serving mercury-contaminated seafood to post consumer advisory warnings . * 70 percent of California supermarkets did not have adequate signage to warn consumers about mercury-contaminated seafood . Shortly after the release of the report , the National Fisheries Institute issued a press advisory urging reporters to disregard the report on the basis that it might cause public harm by leading individuals , including mothers and children , to consume less fish and lose the benefits from Omega-3 fatty acids that can be important to early childhood development . In January 2011 , the group secretly tested samples of seafood bought from California retailers . The group tested swordfish , tuna , halibut , and salmon for traces of methylmercury . The results of the study showed that tuna and swordfish purchased from some supermarkets and sushi restaurants contained as much as three times the FDA limit for mercury contamination . Representatives of the seafood industry criticized the report , arguing that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detrimental to public health . Pamela Tom , manager of the seafood extension program at University of California at San Diego also noted that there have been no cases of methylmercury poisoning from fish documented with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . # Funding # Currently , the Turtle Island Restoration Network provides organizational support for STRP , Got Mercury ? , as well as the SPAWN . Between 1999 and 2008 , the Turtle Island Restoration Network has received $93,000 from The Foundation for Deep Ecology , an organization founded by fashion executive Douglas Tompkins .

6754514 allegiance =Union The 8th Connecticut Infantry was an infantry regiment that fought in the Union Army during the American Civil War . # History # The regiment was organized at Camp Buckingham , Hartford , in September , 1861 , It was first commanded by Colonel Edward Harland of Norwich . The regiment drew most of its enlisted from northern Hartford and Litchfield counties and was composed mostly of merchants and farmers form the Housatonic River and CT River Valleys south to near New Milford and north to the Massachusetts state line and west to present day Hartford . The division had many free black men as well . The regiment left Hartford October 17 , 1861 for a camp of instruction at Jamaica , Long Island , and there received its colors . It proceeded to Annapolis , where it spent the fall . Early in January , 1862 , the Eighth sailed with the Burnside Expedition to North Carolina as part of the IX Corps . It was held in reserve during the Battle of Roanoke Island . It was engaged in the Battle of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then participated in the successful siege of Fort Macon , during the March and April 1862 . From there the regiment proceeded to Fredricksburg in July , 1862 . On September 1 the Eighth accompanied the Union Army to Washington , and on September 8 , joined the Maryland Campaign , including action at South Mountain . The Battle of Antietam on September 17 , 1862 , resulted in a greater number of casualties for the regiment than any other engagement of the war . Along with other regiments of Harland 's Brigade , the Eighth marched downstream from Burnside 's Bridge , and crossed the Antietam at Snaveley 's Ford . They proceeded up the slopes towards Sharpsburg to attack the Confederates , finally being repulsed by reinforcements under Gen. A. P. Hill at the close of the day 's fighting . After Antietam , the Eighth stayed in Pleasant Valley til marching back to Fredricksburg , with the Army of the Potomac , assuming their old camps at the Lacey House . Soon it was involved in the contested crossing of the Rappahannock , where over 80 men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pontoon bridges . The Battle of Fredericksburg followed on December 13 , 1862 , and they were moved towards Marye 's Heights in the last assault . However darkness fell and the Eighth only advanced as far as the bed of the Richmond , Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad , never having been heavily engaged . Following their participation in Burnside 's Mud March , the Eighth left of the IX Corps early in 1863 , and went to Newport News , then to Suffolk , Virginia . They participated in the siege there for several months . It was there that the Eighth , now under Col. John Ward , attacked Fort Huger and took it by surprise in a daring raid . The regiment remained in the Portsmouth area during the summer , and participated in the Blackberry Raid demonstration in force . In December 1863 , 310 original members of the regiment re-enlisted , and in January were sent home on veteran furloughs . Those who had volunteered in 1862 and 1863 were temporarily transferred to the 15th Connecticut and remained in southeastern Virginia . The year of 1864 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the James . There they participated in the battles of Walthall Junction , Fort Darling , Drewry 's Bluff , Cold Harbor , and the siege of Petersburg .

The Eighth was with the 24th Corps , Army of the James in its final advance on Richmond in the spring of 1865 . After Gen. Lee 's surrender at Appomattox , the Eighth moved to Lynchburg , Virginia where it performed police and provost duties until it was mustered out of service December 12 , 1865 , serving a longer term than all but two other Connecticut regiments . # Principal engagements # * New Bern , N.C. , March 17 , 1862 * Fort Macon , N.C. , April 1862 * Antietam , Md. , September 17 , 1862 * Fredricksburg , Va. , December 11 and 13 , 1862 * Fort Huger , Va. , April 11 and April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 , 1864 * Fort Darling or 2d Drewry 's Bluff , Va. , May 12 to May 16 , 1864 * Cold Harbor , Va. , June 1 to 10 1864 * near Petersburg , Va. , June 15 to 17 , 1864 , and June 17 to September 28 , 1864 * Fort Harrison , Va. , September 29 to October 24 , 1864 # Casualties # * Killed and mortally wounded : 112 officers and men * Died of disease : 132 officers and men * Total : 244 officers and men

Going into the game , West Virginia led in the overall matchup , 17-2 . ECU did not need any last-minute heroics to pull off their second straight upset over a ranked BCS-conference school . Quarterback Patrick Pinkney had an almost mistake-free game , going 22-for-28 through the air with a touchdown and no interceptions , while the Pirates defense kept WVU 's normally high-powered offense out of the end zone ( the first time since 2001 any WVU opponent had done so ) .

With the Green Wave up 24-21 in the 4th , the offensive line rallied back . Patrick Pinkney completed a pass to Jamar Bryant for the touchdown and brought the Pirates up 28-24 with 1:28 remaining .

6863514 Below is a list and summary of the former state highways . # State Route 62 # State Route 62 was a state highway in northwestern Arizona running a total of 4 mi from US 93 , north of Kingman to the mining town of Chloride . The road first appeared on a 1936 map and it was deleted from the state highway system in 1972 because of the closure of the mine in Chloride . The road is still in use today as a county route . # State Route 63 # State Route 63 was a state highway in northeastern Arizona . The route first appeared on a state map in 1932 running through the Petrified Forest National Park east of Winslow between then U.S. Route 66 and U.S. Route 260 . The road was decertified in 1933 and is now maintained by the National Park Service . SR 63 then appeared again on a state map in 1961 along a route from U.S. Route 66 in Sanders north to then State Route 164 . The route disappeared on maps in the early 1980s when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Route 160. route= previousroute=62 nextroute=64 previoustype=SR nexttype=US # State Route 65 # State Route 65 was a state highway in northern Arizona traveling in a north-south direction between Payson and Winslow . This road is now part of State Route 87 . It changed route numbers in 1967 , when the last section of paving was completed to link it with State Route 87. # State Route T-69 # This was the link between the eastern end of Interstate 10 where the Maricopa Freeway ended at 40th Street , and Arizona routes 87 and 93 near Mesa and Chandler . When the Maricopa Freeway was built and opened in 1962 , it ended at 40th Street . The Arizona Highway Department apparently wanted to post a truck route around Tempe and Mesa . SR T-69 was signed through the farm fields on 40th Street south to Baseline Road , and then east on Baseline to Country Club Drive in Mesa ( Arizona Avenue in Chandler ) , where it linked with routes 87 and 93 . For a few months in about 1970 , T-69 was the northern terminus for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles ( 6 km ) of freeway were built south from Baseline to Williams Field Road ( now Chandler Blvd . ) . T-69 was not marked as Temporary I-10 , nor was it marked with TO 10 signs . Interstate 10 in the 1960s simply was not marked between Phoenix and Picacho , and remained unsigned until the interstate was opened from Baseline Road in Guadalupe to Picacho in about 1970 . T-69 west of Guadalupe remained a state highway for a few more months , until the Broadway Curve section of Interstate 10 opened ; during this period it was co-signed as the route TO 10 . T-69 was erased when the Phoenix-Tucson freeway was opened . Arizona Highway Department maps of the era referred to the route as TEMP 69 , although State Route 69 never extended south or east beyond the southern end of the Black Canyon Freeway , and T-69 never linked to Route 69. # State Route 81 # State Route 81 was a state highway in eastern Arizona that served Lyman Lake State Park from 19632005 , traversing 1.65 mi from its start at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Springerville to Lyman Lake . The Arizona Department of Transportation turned the road over to the Arizona State Parks Department in 2005 as it was contained within a state park . SR 81 was the shortest state highway in Arizona before State Route 280 was established in 1976 . SR 81 , while short , served as one of the original state routes from 1927 . The route was originally a major highway stretching from Douglas to Safford . In 1936 it took over the old stretch of State Route 71 north to Sanders , but this entire route became part of U.S. Route 666 in 1938 , and subsequently renumbered to U.S. Route 191 in 1992. route= previousroute=80 nextroute=82 previoustype=SR nexttype=SR # State Route 84A # State Route 84A or what is known today as West Miracle Mile in Tucson , Arizona , was designated a state route for a decade in the mid-1950s to mid-1960s to connect State Route 84 to U.S. Route 80 and 89 . This alternative route was used as an in-town route to connect the future freeway to downtown Tucson . When Interstate 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the designation of Temporary I-10 . After I-10 was built , this route was dropped from the state highway list and turned over to the City of Tucson . It is currently used by a different state route , SR 77. # State Route 89L # State Route 89L was a state highway in Page , Arizona . Though the number indicated that it was a loop for State Route 89 , that is incorrect . It was in fact a business loop for U.S. Route 89 through the town of Page , Arizona . It did not intersect SR 89 . Moreover , it was the only Arizona state highway known to have used the L suffix . SR 89L was removed from the state highway system in 2005. route= previousroute=89A nextroute=90 previoustype=SR nexttype=SR # State Route 93 # State Route 93 was a state highway in Arizona that existed from 1946 to 1985 . The route was cosigned with other highways along nearly all of its route from Kingman to the border at Nogales . State Route 93 was the original designation for the highway from Kingman to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point prior to 1964 the northern terminus of the state route was moved south to the unnamed desert junction with U.S. 89 just north of Wickenburg , and the southern terminus of U.S. 93 was moved route south to the U.S. 89 junction . At that junction a driver would pass from U.S. 93 onto State Route 93 . When U.S. 89 was reduced to state highway status in the 1990s , U.S. 93 's southern terminus was moved south a few miles to U.S. 60 in Wickenburg . For some unknown reason , the Arizona Highway Department either never sought , or was never granted , U.S. Highway status for Route 93 across the rest of the state . At its original northern terminus in Kingman , Arizona 93 branched off of U.S. 66 ( Andy Devine Avenue ) at Louise Avenue , which is several miles east of where U.S. Route 93 and U.S. Route 466 branched northwest to Boulder City and Las Vegas . The old two-lane State Route 93 headed east , south of and parallel to the new alignment of Interstate 40 until it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new freeway at DW Ranch Rd . ( I-40 exit 59 ) . The old road turnoff from the current U.S. 93 alignment is still apparent 4.9 mi south of the I-40/93 interchange . From Wickenburg to the southeast , State Route 93 was co-signed with U.S. Route 60 , U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 89 to Phoenix , via Grand Avenue . At Grand Avenue 's terminus at Van Buren and Seventh avenues ( Five Points ) , the quartet of highways picked up U.S. Route 80 from San Diego . The 93 emblem was at the bottom of the routes 60-70-80-89-93 totem pole for years ( along with Business Loop 10 in the 1970s and ' 80s ) for a short time ending in 1965 ) through Phoenix on Van Buren Street . The co-signing continued through Tempe on Mill Avenue and Apache Trail , and Mesa 's Main Street ( but without B-10 , which went south from Phoenix on 48th Street to join the freeway at Broadway Road . ) . At downtown Mesa 's Country Club Drive , State Route 93 made a south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five miles ( 8 km ) south of Chandler , State Route 87 forked off to the southeast and State Route 93 had its own unshared road south about 30 mi to Casa Grande . The middle section of this road was abandoned when it was overlapped by the adjacent Interstate 10 freeway in 1970 . The old road continues a bit south of I-10 's Casa Blanca Road interchange as a Gila Indian route , but dead ends at a new canal . The rest of the road to its former junction near the Interstate 10 interchange with State Route 587 is abandoned . You can see the old road from images on Google Earth or other satellite images . When State Route 93 was delisted , the road to Chandler from the south became State Route 587 to connect State Route 87 south of Chandler with Interstate 10 at Casa Blanca Road . The southern stub , from Interstate 10 to downtown Casa Grande , was posted State Route 387 . Southeast from Casa Grande , State Route 93 overlapped State Route 84 to Tucson . When the Interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Route 84 was truncated at the Picacho traffic interchange ( as was State Route 87 coming in from Coolidge , which to this day terminates there ) . State Route 84 now terminates in Casa Grande . After 1962 , State Route 93 remained cosigned with Interstate 10 from Picacho to Miracle Mile in Tucson , and then was cosigned with Business Loop 10 on Miracle Mile West ( formerly State Route 84A , now the southern-most leg of State Route 77 ) , and then cosigned again with U.S. 80 and U.S. Route 89 ( and State Route 789 , a strange little highway ) down Oracle Road/Miracle Mile/Oracle Road to Drachman Street . ( State Route 789 was delisted about 1966 , U.S. 80 was truncated at Benson in about 1977 . ) In Tucson , the highways zigged three blocks east on Drachman Street to Stone Avenue and then headed south to downtown Tucson . The creation of a one-way northbound Sixth Avenue in the late 1960s , paired with a one-way southbound Stone Avenue from the railroad tracks south to Tucson 's Five Points at 17th Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sixth , and they jagged west on Drachman . This put all the northbound highways on what then and now are residential streets . This one-way couplet was being removed by Tucson engineers at this writing , March 2008 . From 17th Street , both directions of U.S. 80/89 and State Route 93/789 extended south on 6th Avenue through South Tucson to the old South Tucson interchange . This was Arizona 's first cloverleaf , although the ramp curves were basically 50ft m radius U-turns to the right onto a frontage road . It was streamlined into a diamond interchange by 1964 . Old pictures exist of the signs marking U.S. 80 to the north on 6th Avenue and east on Benson Highway , State Route 84 to the west on the new bypass ( which then and now was simply named Freeway , with addresses for roadside motels given as 400 N. Freeway ) , and State Route 86 to the south ( to Ajo Way , then west to Why ) and east ( to the Willcox cutoff ) , as well as U.S. 89 and State Route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mexico , U.S. 89 and State Route 93 and 789 were co-signed to the Grand Avenue border gate in Nogales . Interstate 19 first appeared in a 5mi km stub between Interstate 10 and Valencia Road in about 1963 , and a one-mile ( 1.6 km ) orphan in Green Valley at the same time . The 1960-era highway exists nearly unchanged from Tucson to Green Valley , east of the new Interstate 19 in Tubac and Amado , and in Nogales. # State Route 153 # State Route 153 , also known as the Sky Harbor Expressway , was a state highway in Maricopa County , Arizona , that used to run from the intersection of 44th Street and Washington Street in Phoenix south to University Drive . It was a controlled access arterial expressway , with a speed limit of 45mi/h km/h , lower than the standard freeway speed of 65mi/h km/h . SR 153 was also a north-south route that skirts the eastern edge of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport , and along with SR 143 , SR 153 served a portion of East Valley residents with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SR 143 instead , because of its quick access to and from Interstate 10 and Loop 202 .

By that time , State Route 79 was replaced with Interstate 17 as well . The entire route was replaced by State Route 260 when the 260 designation was extended from Payson across State Route 87 and the General Crook Trail . Although most of SR 279 was replaced by SR 260 , there are two separate parts where the new highway does not run on top of the original .

State Route 789 was a leg of a proposed U.S. 789 , a number proposed for the Canada to Mexico Highway . Boosters wanted to route this new highway marked from Nogales , Arizona , north to Sweetgrass , Montana . Since the highway was to be routed along existing U.S. highways for the majority of its journey , an application for this route to be signed as a U.S. highway was denied by AASHTO . One remnant of U.S. 789 in Wyoming remains to this day as Wyoming 789 . U.S 789 was to continue north with U.S. 666 through Farmington into Cortez , Colorado . U.S. 160 and State Route 789 turned east to serve Durango . At Durango , State Route 789 turned north again , this time via U.S. 550 .

State Route 789 turned east via U.S. 10-212 ( now Interstate 90 and U.S. 212 ) into Billings . U.S. 87 and State Route 789 merged from Billings all the way to Great Falls , which brought SR 789 westward again . Then State Route 789 turned due north along U.S. 91 ( now I-15 ) to its end at Sweetgrass , Montana . As the Association of American State Highway Administrators never approved the concept of U.S. 789 , all the state route segments started to disappear , with State Route 789 decertified about 1965 . The only stand-alone section of putative U.S. 789 is a section of Wyoming 789. route= previousroute=587 nextroute=801 previoustype=SR nexttype=SR

In this programme , art and design students were not taught specific skills for any of the disciplines of art and design , but visual literacy in the use of colour , establishment of form and construction of space . Out of this , and similar experiments undertaken by Victor Pasmore and Richard Hamilton at Kings College Newcastle , a new introductory course for art , design and architecture students emerged , called the Foundation Course , which went on to became the standard degree course-entry qualification for art , design and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Canada and elsewhere . At Leeds Thubron also established close links between the art college and the School of Fine Art at the University of Leeds , which allowed the University 's Gregory Fellows in Fine Art to start teaching at Leeds College of Art . He also helped to create a prototype for Britain 's Polytechnics by sending his students to work on collaborative projects with engineering students from Leeds College of Technology , out of which Leeds Polytechnic was formed . This was also a time when Thubron organised a series of summer schools in Scarborough , North Yorkshire , through which his ideas on art education were shared with artists , art teachers and art students from all over the country , thereby spreading his philosophy . Thubron 's own artwork often comprises constructions made from various materials , often industrial in origin . In terms of art his philosophy was that art could be made from anything , but it was always a visual phenomenon and not a conceptual illustration . In 1964 Thubron left Leeds and became a lecturer at Lancaster until 1966 . Thubron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although he only held this post for three years ( until 1968 ) due to increasing ill health . He still continued some teaching after this , as a part-time tutor at Goldsmiths ' College , London , between 1971 and 1982 . Notable students of Thubron include Stass Paraskos , who went on to establish the Cyprus College of Art , on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus using Thurbon 's theories , and this institution still exists as a Thubronite art institution today . Thubron has several of his artworks in Tate Britain , and regional collections in England , such as Leeds City Art Gallery . # References # <references/>

In 1110 , 1112 , and 1114 the city of Edessa was the objective ; in 1113 Galilee was invaded , and in 1111 and 1115 the Latin possessions which lay east of the Orontes between Aleppo and Shaizar . The attack on Edessa in 1110 failed to take the city . In 1111 , Mawdud of Mosul led a host which fought Baldwin I 's Frankish army to a draw in the Battle of Shaizar . Afterward , the Muslim leader 's army dispersed because of its lack of success and plunder . In 1112 and 1114 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other four years , the Crusader states - the Kingdom of Jerusalem , Principality of Antioch , County of Tripoli and County of Edessa - joined forces in defense . # Battle # In 1113 , Mawdud joined Toghtekin of Damascus and their combined army aimed to cross the Jordan River south of the Sea of Galilee . Baldwin I offered battle near the bridge of Al-Sannabra . Mawdud used the device of a feigned flight to entice Baldwin I into rashly ordering a charge . The Frankish army was surprised and beaten when it unexpectedly ran into the main Turkish army . The surviving Crusaders kept their cohesion and fell back to a hill west of the inland sea where they fortified their camp . In this position they were reinforced from Tripoli and Antioch but remained inert . A number of Christian pilgrims also rallied to the army after Al-Sannabra . Unable to annihilate the Crusaders , Mawdud watched them with his main army while sending raiding columns to ravage the countryside and sack the town of Nablus . In this , Mawdud anticipated the strategy of Saladin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belvoir Castle ( 1182 ) and the Battle of Al-Fule ( 1183 ) . As in these campaigns , the Frankish field army could oppose the main Muslim army , but it could not stop raiding forces from doing great damage to crops and towns . While the Turkish raiders roamed freely through Crusader lands , the local Muslim farmers entered into friendly relations with them . This deeply troubled the Frankish land magnates , who ultimately depended upon rents from cultivators of the soil . # Aftermath # Mawdud was unable to make any permanent conquests after his victory . Soon afterward , he was assassinated and Aq-Sunqur Bursuqi took command of the failed attempt against Edessa in 1114 . Roger of Salerno routed the last Seljuk invading army at the Battle of Sarmin after a protracted campaign in 1115

The money paid for the seats by the players constitutes the prize money . The tournament itself is run as a single elimination ( knockout tournament ) with the prize money being awarded as a jackpot to the outright winner . A more formal name for a Camden Auction is an Entry Fee Auction Tournament . The colloquial name comes from the fact that these tournaments were first used in British backgammon at the Backgammon in Camden club , which is a part of the Backgammon in London organisation .

7124514 The Mary Murphy Mine was the principal gold mine of the Chalk Creek mining district of Chaffee County , Colorado , United States , near St. Elmo , Colorado . The Mary Murphy Mine operated continuously from 1870 to 1925 , and produced 220 thousand ounces of gold , worth $4.4 million then ( or about $180,000,000 in 2008 ) , plus considerable silver , lead , and zinc . There were two aerial tramways connecting the mine to Romley , Colorado and the Denver , South Park and Pacific Railroad .

In 1648 , when the Parliamentary visitors came to the college , and Ellis was asked whether he meant to submit to the authority of Parliament , he replied that he could not without the hazard of shipwrackinge of my soule . He later submitted and was appointed Fellow of the College in 1649 , although he was a critic of the Parliamentary-appointed Principal , Michael Roberts . Ellis kept his fellowship on the Restoration , becoming vice-principal under Francis Mansell . He hoped to be appointed to succeed Mansell in 1661 , but the position went to Leoline Jenkins and Ellis then gave up his teaching duties ( although he retained his fellowship until 1667 ) . Ellis had a particular interest in the study of Welsh history . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hengwrt intended to publish a new edition of ' ' The Historie of Cambria ' ' by David Powel and asked Ellis to complete the work , using Vaughan 's notes as well as his own . However in 1663 , after 128 sheets of the book had been printed , Ellis complained that all of Vaughan 's material had been published in 1661 by Percie Enderbie and refused to continue . ' ' Memoirs of Owen Glendowr ' ' , published in 1775 , was attributed to Ellis , but Sir John Edward Lloyd later showed that Vaughan had written it , with Ellis simply being the copyist . In 1665 , King Charles II , his court and Parliament moved to Oxford to escape the plague , and Ellis 's fortunes improved . He succeeded his kinsman John Ellis as rector of St Mary 's , Dolgellau , Merionethshire . He died in April 1673 in Ystumllyn , and was buried there .

With James Bouill and Xavier de Langlais , he also helped to found An Droellen , the Breton studio of Christian Art . In 1927 , in collaboration with the painter Ren-Yves Creston , he designed the costumes for three plays : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jean-Marie Perrot , ' ' Tog Jani ' ' by Yves Le Moal and ' ' Lina ' ' by Roparz Hemon , the first performance of which took place in January 1927 . Soon becoming well known , he received many commissions from churches and chapels in Brittany , including bas-reliefs for altars , as well as war memorials , which were built in large numbers at this period after World War I. Some of Le Bozec 's sculptures were reproduced by the ceramics company ' ' Faencerie HB-Henriot ' ' in Quimper , whose activities date back to 1690 . Among these were Woman Digging ( 1930 ) which is a reduced version of the sculpture ' ' Earth ' ' , which had been exhibited at the Salon in 1927 .

The chapel is seen as a significant attempt to create a distinctive modern Breton architecture . In 1946 , he created the granite statue of ' ' Our Lady of Kerdro ' ' in Locmariaquer. 2.70 metres high , the sculpture was left for sixteen years in the church before being moved to the edge of Kerpenhir to replace another statue that had been erected in 1883 , but had been destroyed during World War II .

7487514 The Pacific robin ( ' ' Petroica multicolor ' ' ) , is a red-breasted Australasian robin in the passerine bird genus ' ' Petroica ' ' found on Norfolk Island , Melanesia and Polynesia . It is similar in plumage to the scarlet robin of Australia , and until recently the two were considered conspecific until split in 1999 by Schodde and Mason . 14 subspecies of Pacific robin are currently recognised , and these subspecies display considerable variation in plumage , foraging preferences and habitat . # Description # The Pacific robin is a small passerine , 11.5&amp;ndash ; 13.5 cm long and weighing 9&amp;ndash ; 11 g . Over much of its range it is the smallest species of bird . The plumage of the males and females is dimorphic , and the extent of this varies depending on the subspecies . The male of the nominate race has a black head with a white forehead , a black back and tail , and the wings are also black with a white bar . The breast and belly are red , and the lower belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead and the white bar on the wing ; and the black plumage of the male is replaced by dark brown feathers instead . The breast is a duller red than the male and has more brown on the sides , and the white on the rump also smaller . Both sexes have black legs and bills . Amongst the subspecies , some males have more female-like plumage , for example ' ' P. m. femenina ' ' of central Vanuatu ; in others the female more closely resembles the male . The males of ' ' P. m. polymorpha ' ' of Makira in the Solomon Islands have two different plumage morphs , including one with no white on the forehead but an all rufous-brown head . For a complete list of the differences in subspecies plumages see below . # Distribution and habitat # The Pacific robin inhabits the islands of the south western Pacific . It ranges from Bougainville in Papua New Guinea through the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu down to Norfolk Island ( although the species is absent from New Caledonia ) and eastwards through Fiji into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although there may be some small localised movements of birds in the non-breeding seasons . A fossil found on the islands of Ha'apai in Tonga show that the species once occurred in the group but is now extinct there . # Diet and feeding # Insects , spiders and pseudoscorpions make up the majority of the diet of Pacific robins . They generally feed in the lower sections of the forest , although they will ascend to the forest canopy occasionally . They will join with mixed-species feeding flocks in order to forage . Prey is obtained by aerial flycatching , gleaning , sallying and pouncing , with different populations favouring different methods . # Breeding # The Pacific robin is a seasonal breeder , although the timing of the breeding season varies across its range . Information on the timing of the season is patchy or absent in many islands . On Norfolk Island the breeding season is from September to December , and in Vanuatu the season is from October to January . Parents with young have been seen in mid August in the Solomon Islands and in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact nest which is a cup of plant fibres and spider webs . The outside of the nest is decorated with moss and lichen , and is therefore easily overlooked . The nest is usually set into a fork or stump on a tree branch , or on a horizontal branch . Around two to four eggs are laid in each clutch , with two being the typical clutch size in Norfolk Island , and two to three being typical in Fiji . The eggs are dull grey or greenish , and are incubated by the female . The nests of Pacific robins are parastised by fan-tailed cuckoos where the two species co-occur . # Threats and conservation # The Pacific robin is not considered globally threatened . Individual subspecies may be threatened by local habitat loss , and the nominate race from Norfolk Island is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and introduced species . # Taxonomy # The Pacific robin was originally described by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789 , from a collection in Norfolk Island . It was considered conspecific with the scarlet robin of Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It forms a species group along with the scarlet robin and the tomtit of New Zealand . It is one of five red- or pink-breasted species of robin in the genus ' ' Petroica ' ' ; they are colloquially known as red robins . Although named after the European robin , is not closely related to it or the American robin . Along with the other Australian robins , it was classified for many years as a member of the old world flycatcher family Muscicapidae , before being placed in the whistler family Pachycephalidae . The robins were also placed in their own family Petroicidae , or Eopsaltridae . Sibley and Alquist 's DNA-DNA hybridisation studies placed the robins in a Corvida parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines including pardalotes , fairy-wrens and honeyeaters as well as crows . However , subsequent molecular research ( and current consensus ) places the robins as a very early offshoot of the Passerida ( advanced songbirds ) . # Subspecies # <onlyinclude> </onlyinclude>

7641514 area=0.12 hectares Lower Dicker is a 0.12 hectare ( 0.23 acre ) geological Site of Special Scientific Interest in East Sussex , England . The site was notified in 1998 under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 . The site is a small , overgrown quarry approximately four kilometres north-west of Hailsham . # Geology # Exposures of a sand member are present in the quarry . The sand is of the lower division of the Weald Clay . The sandstone units of the Weald Clay Group represent river deposits which periodically extended into the Wealden lake or lagoon . The sandstones are important as lithostratigraphical markers ( units of rock with the same affinity ) and are considered to reflect the effects of tectonic uplift in nearby areas feeding sediment into the area . The mineralogy of these sandstones reflects their provenance and they are therefore of great importance for understanding the changes which took place in the palaeogeography of the Weald .

7648514 The history of slavery in Alaska is different from that of the other states that comprise the United States of America . Whereas the continental United States mostly saw enslavement of Africans brought across the Atlantic Ocean , in Alaska indigenous people , and some whites , enslaved indigenous people from other tribes . The Haida and Tlingit tribes held slaves . Some of these enslaved people escaped to the Ebbits who took them in . This in turn brought forth the wrath of the Haida and Tlingit , which resulted in the Ebbits losing territory to the aggrieved tribes . Slavery was abolished in all states under the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which took effect on December 18 , 1865 . When Alaska was purchased by the United States in 1867 , slavery became illegal in Alaska . When the Ebbits discovered this , thinking it was due to Abraham Lincoln issuing the Emancipation Proclamation , they built a totem pole in Abraham Lincoln 's honor . A common addition to the story is that one group of Tlingit was escaping another , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery . However , some authorities say that the totem pole was actually built by the proslavery Tlingit to shame Lincoln , not to honor him . The totem was 55 feet tall and bore the likeness of Lincoln wearing a silk hat and frock coat . The totem is currently at the Alaska State Museum in the state capital of Juneau , Alaska . In 1903 there were still documented cases of slavery in the territory . Aleutian girls could be purchased by wealthy families to do the housework , and were often not allowed to participate in child play or become educated . These girls tended to come from the Atta Islands . From 1911 until the passage of the Fur Seal Act in 1966 , the inhabitants of the Pribilof Islands were governed directly by employees of the United States federal government , under conditions which the ' ' Tundra Times ' ' described in 1964 as slavery in milder form perhaps than existed in the Deep South , but slavery nonetheless ; these conditions included being paid for their labor in food rather than in money ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffrage , being denied freedom of assembly , and being denied freedom of movement , all on the grounds that they did not count as American citizens . In 2001 , four individuals were arrested for enslaving six Russian females , two of whom were only sixteen , for the purpose of having them perform in strip clubs , under threat of violence if they did not comply .

She won a league and cup double with Valur in 2006 . Margrt Lra 's goalscoring record in Iceland meant that she was pursued by several leading clubs in Europe and America . The Germans FCR 2001 Duisburg won the race for her signature and in October 2006 she scored twice in Duisburg 's 32 win at holders Turbine Potsdam in the Frauen DFB Pokal . Margrt Lra failed to settle in Germany and returned to Valur in January 2007 , citing homesickness . A record breaking season in 2007 saw Margrt Lra hit 38 goals in 16 league matches for Valur .

At Linkpings Margrt Lra struggled to replicate her earlier form and started four of her 12 matches in the first half of the season , scoring twice . She wanted more playing time ahead of the 2009 European Championships so moved to Kristianstads DFF during the mid-season break . Although Kristianstads were a lower ranked team , she was happy to move in order to reunite with Elisabet Gunnarsdottir who had been her coach at Valur . She won the Damallsvenskan top scorer award in 2011 , tied at 16 goals with Manon Melis of LdB FC Malm . In October 2011 she signed for German champions Turbine Potsdam .

7689514 In hydrology , the inflow of a body of water is the source of the water in the body of water . It can also refer to the average volume of incoming water in unit time . It is contrasted with outflow . Outflow is the amount of water that leaves the country . Inflow is mostly used when referring to rivers , and the amount of water in units that enters the country . # Overview # All bodies of water have multiple inflows , but often , one inflow may predominate and be the largest source of water . However , in many cases , no single inflow will predominate and there will be multiple primary inflows . For a lake , the inflow may be a river or stream that literally flows into the lake . Inflow may also be , strictly speaking , not flows , but rather precipitation , like rain . Inflow can also be used to refer to groundwater recharge. 
7693514 The Dcoration du Lys was a medal created by the Bourbon Restoration . # Background # From the end of 1813 , Napoleon 's armies were fighting on their own soil , culminating in the Six Days Campaign . Napoleon ended his reign with a series of Pyrrhic victories which could not save the Empire , and he abdicated on 5 April 1814 . In a Paris occupied by the forces of the Coalition , the National Guard ensured public order by wearing a white cockade , abandoning the Revolutionary tricolour cockade , and it was on this corps that the returning Bourbons chose to found their power , rather than the Imperial armies and their officers , which they judged still to be too unreliable. # Creation # King Louis XVIII arrived in Paris on 3 May with his brother Charles de Bourbon , Comte dArtois , the future Charles X. It was then that little medals with the image of the new king and fleurs de lys , on white ribbons , began to circulate to reassure and appease the Paris population . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 1814 , created the Dcoration du Lys for the garde nationale of Paris as a perpetual sign of the services it has rendered , whether in fighting for their homes and , charged alone on the night of 30 March with ensuring Paris 's guard and safety , preserving the king 's capital for the king and the goods , lives and honour of so many families , or - when occupying posts beside those of the troops of the line - it rendered them an example of devotion and sacrifice , or when - despite this painful service - it acted as the maison militaire du Roi and granted the royal family the satisfaction of , for their guard , not being surrounded by the French . By an order of the day on 9 May 1814 , king Louis XVIII approved the creation of the Dcoration du Lys , extending it to all the gardes nationales of France . It was awarded to the national guards after they took the following oath - I swear fidelity to God , and to the King , forever The granting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent . Assuring the loyalty of the social elite to the new monarchy thanks to this simple honour , the award of the Dcoration du Lys would be extended again and again , quickly starting to be awarded in all France 's regions then royal officials granted them successively to generals , ministers , prefects , and finally even mayors . It was banned during the Hundred Days , then reinstated on the Second Restoration , only to be suppressed once and for all by an ordinance of Louis Philippe on 10 February 1831. # Beneficiaries # * Order of April 26 1814 : the Dcoration du Lys was to be granted solely to the troops of the national guard of Paris officers , sous-officiers , grenadiers or chasseurs who have justified their well-deserving them * Order of May 9 1814 : the granting of the Dcoration du Lys was extended to all the national guards of France . Then it was awarded equally to officials of various administrations , to notables , to deputation members , to high-level and general officers , etc. # Characteristics # # Ribbons # * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a simple white ribbon . * ' ' Ordinance of 9 May 1814 ' ' : white ribbon moir with a white rosette ; but to distinguish the garde nationale de Paris , the arms of Paris were embroidered or marked on the ribbon * ' ' Ordinance of 5 August 1814 ' ' : the ribbon of the Garde nationale de Paris became white with , along each side , a 2mm blue stripe. * ' ' Ordinance of 5 February 1816 ' ' : each of the gardes nationales dpartementales bore the Dcoration du Lys on a ribbon specific to its department , with only 12 of France 's 86 departments retaining the white ribbon . # Bars # * ' ' Ordinance of 9 May 1814 ' ' : for civil holders , the king authorised the wearing of a simple white ribbon , sometimes with a three-band bar , generally in silver but sometimes in gold , representing a reduction of the croix du Lys , or a lily ( often crowned and bordered by two olive branches ) As with the croix du Lys , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le Roi ' ' . These bars were sometimes borne on the ribbon of the Lgion dhonneur. # Insignia # * ' ' Ordinance of 26 April 1814 ' ' : a simple fleur de lys in silver . * ' ' Ordinance of 9 May 1814 ' ' : a silver fleur de lys from the royal crown . * ' ' Ruling of 31 August 1816 ' ' : after too many abuses of the insignia ( mostly eccentric ) , the count of Artois fixed the definitive rules for wearing the Dcoration du Lys. * ' ' 5 May 1824 ' ' : the grand chancellor of the Lgion dhonneur recalled that the Dcoration du Lys having furnished a pretext for a multitude of abuses , the king put its supervision under the grand chancellor . He therefore recalled that this decoration must only be a simple silver fleur de lys hung from a white ribbon or of the colours set out for each of the departments of the kingdom ( ... ) The mania for ribbons and decorations , the cupidity of some jewellers , fantasies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitating royal or foreign orders . It was ruled that each ribbon must be worn only for one department and the simple , long-established fleur de lys was to be the only one allowed ; all the others were abolished and must disappear . # Did an Ordre du Lys exist ? # The Dcoration du Lys was often called the Ordre du Lys . Even if from 1824 it was controlled by the grand chancellory of the Lgion dhonneur , it never had a Grand Master or a chancellory of its own , and is never called an Order in the official documents . # Dcoration de la Fidlit # In 1816 the 600 National Guards serving in Paris in 1815 received the Dcoration de la Fidlit , created by order of Louis XVIII on 5 February 1816 to replace the Dcoration du Lys . Strictly speaking , it was not a new decoration but mainly a particular version of the Dcoration du Lys , albeit one strictly reserved for thes 600 Guards . It was in gold , and not widely awarded .

7703514 The right to development was first recognized in 1981 in Article 22 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples ' Rights as a definitive individual and collective right . Article 22(1) provides that : All peoples shall have the right to their economic , social and cultural development with due regard to their freedom and identity and in the equal enjoyment of the common heritage of mankind . The right to development was subsequently proclaimed by the United Nations in 1986 in the Declaration on the Right to Development , which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly resolution 41/128 . The Right to development is a group right of peoples as opposed to an individual right , and was reaffirmed by the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action . The concept of the Right to Development is controversial , with some commentators ( See for one reference. ) disputing whether it is a right at all . The meaning of the right to development has been elaborated in a number of sources . The right to development is now included in the mandate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Declaration on the Right to Development states development is a comprehensive economic , social , cultural and political process , which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom . # The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action # The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action states in Article 10 The World Conference on Human Rights reaffirms the ' ' right to development , as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development , as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights . As stated in the Declaration on the Right to Development , the human person is the central subject of development . While development facilitates the enjoyment of all human rights , the lack of development may not be invoked to justify the abridgement of internationally recognized human rights . States should cooperate with each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development . The international community should promote an effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the elimination of obstacles to development . Lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level . # The Rio Declaration # The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , also known as Rio Declaration or the G.R.E.G , recognizes the right to development as one of its 27 principles . Principle 3 of the Declaration states The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations . # Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples # The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples recognizes the right to development as an indigenous peoples ' right .

7806514 Levi Richardson ( 1851 - April 5 , 1879 ) was an Old West gunman , gambler and buffalo hunter . During his lifetime , Richardson was quite well known . Richardson was born in Wisconsin , migrating to Dodge City , Kansas after first working for a lengthy period as a buffalo hunter . When he first arrived in Dodge City , his reputation as being a gunman came with him , although it was mostly , if not all , hearsay . Richardson no doubt had been involved in several shootouts with Native Americans while on the plains , but as to actual Old West gunfights , no records are known to exist , his only confirmed gunfight being the one in which he was killed . It is believed that Richardson first arrived in Dodge City around 1874 , drifting in and out over time , spending much of his time gambling , and in doing so making that his primary employment . He quickly became well known around the cattle town , and was not particularly well liked , although some sources say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had known him during his buffalo hunting days , to include Eugene LeCompt and H.H. Henry Raymond , who said at best he was an unpleasant man . During this time he met in passing Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday . He also met and became friends with Frank Loving , a young gambler . By all accounts , Loving and Richardson got along well until early 1879 , at which time evidently Loving , who had married , believed Richardson was acting inappropriately and disrespectfully toward the latters wife , Mattie . This led to problems between the two men , resulting in numerous verbal clashes , and in March , 1879 , the two became involved in a fist fight on Front Street . After that fight , Richardson told Loving I 'll blow the guts out of you , you cockeyed son of a bitch , to which Loving , who was not armed at the time , simply turned and walked away . The arguments between the two men culminated in Richardson walking into the ' ' Long Branch Saloon ' ' on April 5 , 1879 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Loving was not in the saloon at the time , so Richardson waited for him , with Loving appearing some time after 9:00pm . Loving seated himself near a potbellied stove at a long table , at which time Richardson went and joined him . The two , by witness accounts , had a low conversation which no one could hear , then suddenly Richardson stood and said You would n't fight anything , you damn son of a bitch , to which Loving calmly and simply replied Try me and see . Richardson drew his gun first , prompting Loving to do the same , with the two men less than an arms length apart . Richardson fired five rounds to Loving 's six , with Richardson grazing Loving 's hand , but himself receiving bullet wounds to his chest , side and arm . Deputy Town Marshal Duffy entered the saloon first , disarming Richardson as the latter fell to the floor . Town Marshal Charlie Bassett arrived also , and Loving was arrested , standard procedure in such a case . Richardson died on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence in a coroners inquest , with no trial . The gunfight , which later became known as the ' ' Long Branch Saloon Gunfight ' ' , gave notoriety to Loving .

7841514 Some more recent research has other findings , but according to early twentieth century writers in 1932 , an interregnum queen , is a Great Royal Wife of a previous pharaoh who rules as a regent in the place of her heir-son , who has not yet reached the age to solely assume the role of pharaoh of Egypt . Officially the young heir-son is assumed to be king , ' ' de iure ' ' , making , in theory , his mother a co-regent . In practice , the interregnum queen rules ' ' in the place ' ' of the young male heir as sole ruler , until the heir-son reaches an age when he could assume the duties of pharaoh alone . The term Interregnum Queen may have been the equivalent of the term King 's Mother . # Notes #

7866514 The former Cleveland Home For Aged Colored People located at 4807 Cedar Avenue in Cleveland , Ohio , is an historic building built in the early 1900s as a residential facility for elderly black people . The home was founded by Eliza Bryant , a woman who was active in welcoming African Americans migrating to Cleveland from southern states . In her work , she learned that elderly African Americans were often left alone as a result of slavery . With the help of Sarah Green and Lethia Flemming , she began in 1893 to establish a home for the elderly . The home opened on August 11 , 1897 . The Cedar Avenue building operated as a 19-bed facility from 1914 through 1967 , when the board made the decision to move to a larger 47-bed facility at 1380 Addison Road . The home had been renamed in 1960 to the Eliza Bryant Home for the Aged in recognition of its founder .

7911514 The Shrine of the Cloak ( Pashto : ' ' Kerqa Sharif ' ' ) is located adjacent to the main mosque in Kandahar , Afghanistan . It contains the ' ' Kerqa ' ' , a cloak believed to have been worn by Muhammad . It is therefore widely held to be one of the holiest Islamic sites in Afghanistan , and even considered by some as the heart of Afghanistan . The building 's exteriors are of green marble from Lashkar Gah , with tiled surfaces and gilded archways . The cloak itself is locked away inside the mosque and is rarely seen . It has been guarded by the same family for over 250 years . Its guardians have traditionally only shown the cloak to recognized leaders of Afghanistan , although in times of great crisis such as natural disasters , it has been publicly displayed as a means of reassurance . The cloak was given to Amir Ahmad Shah Durrani by Amir Murad Beg of Bukhara in 1768 in order to solidify a treaty between the two leaders . An alternate account states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloak of Muhammad . He then decided to take the artifact with him to Kandahar , and asked whether he could borrow the cloak from its keepers . They , worrying that he might try to remove it from Bukhara , told him it could not be taken from the city . Ahmad Shah then is said to have pointed to a heavy stela of stone firmly planted in the ground , saying that he would never take the cloak far from the stone . The keepers , gratified at his answer , handed him the cloak . Ahmad Shah then took the cloak , ordered the stone slab to be dug up , and carried them both back with him to Kandahar , where the stone now stands near his ' ' mazar ' ' ( tomb ) . The cloak was last seen in public in 1996 , when Mullah Omar , the up-and-coming leader of the Taliban , removed it from the shrine and donned the cloak while he stood atop a building , and in front of a large crowd of his followers . That symbolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Taliban , and Mullah Omar himself , associating him with both Ahmed Shah Durrani and the Prophet of Islam . Upon donning the cloak , the crowd began to shout ' ' Amir al-Mu'minin ' ' ( Commander of the Faithful ) , a title that Ayman al-Zawahiri still occasionally uses to refer to Mullah Omar in his radio addresses . Wahid Muzhda , an Afghan analyst and one-time high-ranking official in the Taliban foreign ministry , disputes Mullah Omar donning the cloak . From what I know , from sources close to Omar , and from a chat with the keeper of the shrine where the cloak is kept , Omar did not wear the cloak . Wahid Muzhda 's doubts notwithstanding , in a New York Times piece from winter 2001 , the current keeper of the Shrine , Qari Shawali , claimed that he not only allowed Mullah Omar to view the cloak , but that it was borrowed and removed from the Shrine in the spring of 1996 by Mullah Omar .

7960514 A drum stick is a type of percussion mallet used particularly for playing snare drum , drum kit and some other percussion instruments , and particularly for playing unpitched percussion . Specialized beaters used on some other percussion instruments , such as the metal beater or ' ' wand ' ' used with a triangle , and particularly beaters or ' ' mallets ' ' used with tuned percussion such as xylophone and timpani , are not normally referred to as ' ' drum sticks ' ' . Drum sticks generally have all of the following characteristics : * they normally come in a set of 8 for the kit . * They are held in the hands , most often one in each hand . * They may be used to play at least some sort of drum ( as well as other instruments ) . * They are normally used only for untuned percussion . # Construction # The archetypical drum stick is turned from a single piece of wood , most commonly of hickory , less commonly of maple , and least commonly but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional form are also made from metal , carbon fibre and other modern materials . The tip or bead is the part most often used to strike the instrument . Originally and still commonly of the same piece of wood as the rest of the stick , sticks with nylon tips have also been available since 1958 , originally conceived by Jonathan Pumphrey and Joe Calato in Niagara Falls , NY . In the 1970s , an acetal tip was introduced , designed by Ken Drinan and Paul Kiersted . Tips of whatever material are of various shapes , including acorn , barrel , oval and round . The shoulder of the stick is the part that tapers towards the tip , and is normally slightly convex . It is often used for playing the bell of a cymbal . It can also be used to produce a cymbal crash when applied with a glancing motion to the bow or rim of a cymbal , and for playing ride patterns on china , swish and pang cymbals . The shaft is the body of the stick , and is cylindrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is used for playing cross stick and applied in a glancing motion to the rim of a cymbal for the loudest cymbal crashes . The butt is the opposite end of the stick to the tip . Some rock musicians use it rather than the tip . # Conventional numbering # Plain wooden drum sticks are most commonly described using a number to describe the weight and diameter of the stick followed by one or more letters to describe the tip . For example , a 7A is a common jazz stick with a wooden tip , while a 7N is the same weight of stick with a nylon tip , and a 7B is a wooden tip but with a different tip profile , shorter and rounder than a 7A . A 5A is a common wood tipped rock stick , heavier than a 7A but with a similar profile . The numbers are most commonly odd but even numbers are used occasionally , in the range 2 ( heaviest ) to 9 ( lightest ) . The exact meanings of both numbers and letters differ from manufacturer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system at all , just being known as ' ' Jazz ' ' ( typically a 7N or 8N ) or ' ' Heavy Rock ' ' ( typically a 4B or 5B ) for example . The most general purpose stick is a 5A ( wood tip , for snare tone ) or 5AN ( nylon tip , for cymbal tone ) . # Techniques # # Grip # There are two main ways of holding drumsticks : * Traditional grip , in which right and left hands use different grips . * Matched grip , in which the two hand grips are mirror-image . Traditional grip was developed to conveniently play a snare drum while marching , and was documented and popularised by Sanford A. Moeller in ' ' The Art of Snare Drumming ' ' ( 1925 ) .

8453514 Atlantic history is a specialty field in history that studies of the Atlantic World in the early modern period . It is premised on the idea that , following the rise of sustained European contact with the New World in the 16th century , the continents that bordered the Atlantic Ocean -- the Americas , Europe , and Africa -- constituted a regional system or common sphere of economic and cultural exchange that can be studied as a totality . Its theme is the complex interaction between Europe ( Britain , France , the Iberian Peninsula ) and the New World colonies . It encompasses a wide range of demographic , social , economic , political , legal , military , intellectual and religious topics treated in comparative fashion by looking at both sides of the Atlantic . Religious revivals characterized Britain and Germany , as well as the First Great Awakening in the American colonies . Migration and race/slavery have been important topics . Practitioners of Atlantic history typically focus on the interconnections and exchanges between these regions and the civilizations they harbored . In particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined the limits of older historiography should not be applied to such transnational phenomena as slavery , colonialism , missionary activity and economic expansion . Environmental history and the study of historical demography also play an important role , as many key questions in the field revolve around the ecological and epidemiological impact of the Columbian Exchange . Robert R. Palmer , an American historian of the French Revolution , pioneered the concept in the 1950s with a wide-ranging comparative history of how numerous nations experienced what he called the ' ' The Age of the Democratic Revolution : A Political History of Europe and America , 1760-1800 ' ' ( 1959 and 1964 ) . Since the 1980s Atlantic history has emerged as an increasingly popular alternative to the older discipline of imperial history , although it could be argued that the field is simply a refinement and reorientation of traditional historiography dealing with the interaction between early modern Europeans and native peoples in the Atlantic sphere . The organization of Atlantic History as a recognized area of historiography began in the 1980s under the impetus of American historians Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopkins University , among others . The post-World War II integration of the European Union and the continuing importance of NATO played an indirect role in stimulating interest throughout the 1990s. # Bailyn # Bailyn 's Seminar on the History of the Atlantic World promoted social and demographic studies , and especially regarding demographic flows of population into colonial America . As a leading advocate of the history of the Atlantic world , Bailyn has organized an annual international seminar at Harvard designed to promote scholarship in this field . Bailyn 's ' ' Atlantic History : Concepts and Contours ' ' ( 2005 ) explores the borders and contents of the emerging field , which emphasizes cosmopolitan and multicultural elements that have tended to be neglected or considered in isolation by traditional historiography dealing with the Americas . Bailyn 's reflections stem in part from his seminar at Harvard since the mid-1980s . Greene directed a program at Johns Hopkins in Atlantic History from 1972 to 1992 that has now expanded to global concerns . Other scholars in the field include John Coombs , Anthony Grafton , Felipe Armesto-Mestre Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Huxtable Elliott , Carla G. Pestana , Isaac Land , and Jorge Canizares-Esguerra. # Perspectives # Games ( 2006 ) explores the convergence of the multiple strands of scholarly interest that have generated the new field of Atlantic history , which takes as its geographic unit of analysis the Atlantic Ocean and the four continents that surround it . She argues Atlantic history is best approached as a slice of world history . The Atlantic , moreover , is a region that has logic as a unit of historical analysis only within a limited chronology . An Atlantic perspective can help historians understand changes within the region that a more limited geographic framework might obscure . Attempts to write a Braudelian Atlantic history , one that includes and connects the entire region , remain elusive , driven in part by methodological impediments , by the real disjunctions that characterized the Atlantic 's historical and geographic components , by the disciplinary divisions that discourage historians from speaking to and writing for each other , and by the challenge of finding a vantage point that is not rooted in any single place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began with the historians of slavery who started tracking the flows of slaves from Africa to the New World in the 1960s . A second source came from historians of colonial America . Many were trained in early modern European history and were familiar with the historiography regarding England and the British Empire. , which had been introduced a century before by George Louis Beer and Charles McLean Andrews . Colonialists have long been open to interdisciplinary perspectives , such as comparative approaches . In addition there was a frustration involved in writing about very few people in a small remote colony . Atlantic history opens the horizon to large forces at work over great distances . # Criticism # Some critics have complained that Atlantic history is little more than imperial history under another name .

No wonder that the academic reception of the new Atlantic history has been enthusiastic in the United States , and less so in Britain , France , Spain , and Portugal , where histories of national Atlantic empires continue to thrive .

8544514 Sofia Noorbakshia ( ) also called Nubakshia is an Islamic sect and the Sufi order and way that claims to trace its direct spiritual lineage and chain ( silsilah ) to the Islamic prophet Muhammad , through Ali , Muhammad 's cousin , son-in-law and the First Imam , via Imam Ali Al-Ridha . In contrast , most other Sufi paths trace their lineage through Ali . This order became famous as Nurbakshi after Shah Syed Muhammad Nurbakhsh Qahistani who was attached with Kubrawiya order Sufi order ( tariqa ) . # Etymology # # Sufia # Two origins of the word Sufi have been suggested . Commonly , the lexical root of the word is traced to af ( ) , which in Arabic means purity . Another origin is f ( ) , wool , referring to the simple cloaks the early Muslim ascetics wore .

It was in the valley of Kashmir and in Baltistan where the Nurbakhshiya gained their greatest prominence in the early 16th century . This was due to the missionary efforts of Mir Sham ud-Din Iraqi , himself a disciple of Sayyid Muhammad Nurbkhsh 's son and spiritual heir , Shah Qasim Faizbakhsh . In its country of origin , Iran , the order became outright Shi'a some decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state in 1501 , and the same happened in Kashmir , either during the lifetime of Shams ud-Din Iraqi , who died in 1527 , or in the following decades during the brief interlude of the Chak dynasty 's reign . But in Baltistan the Nurbakhshiya has survived until this day as a sect with doctrines of its own , combining elements of both Shi'ism and Sunni Islam . Ghousulal-Mutakharin Sayyid al Arifin Mir Sayyid Muhammad Nurbakhsh was the 9th century missionary Sufi master on whom the researchers have paid less attention . That is why we could not trace a detailed biography on his life . Although Nurbakhsh had many scholar-disciples including Assiri lahiji , but none of his disciples made any serious effort to write Nurbakhsh 's biography and to preserve his teachings . However it is a wonderful miracle that hundreds of thousand of his followers are still present in a very far-flung and the most backward areas of Islamic Republic of Pakistan who are practising his teachings in its entirety and who are the custodians of his works and teachings even these days when five centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practices are not an assemblage of his personal view but the practices were originally conceived to him from Islamic Prophet Muhammad through the masters of the spiritual chain . They state that if anyone feels doubt in this connection , they would invite them to travel on the long road through the history of mysticism and to compare it with that of Nurbakhshs teachings . # History # The Sofia Noorbakhshiya has emerged in the 15th century in Iran as a branch of the kubrawiya Sufi order A similar controversy has later developed about the religious affiliation of Sayyid Muhammad Noorbakhsh who had been a disciple of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani , principal successor Khwaja Ishaq Khuttalani , and who became the founder and eponymous of a new branch of the Kubrawiya . Noorbakhshis doctrines were preached in Kashmir and Baltistan in the early 16th century by Mir Sham ud-Din Iraqi himself a disciple of Sayyid Muhammad Noorbakhshis s son and spiritual heir , Shah Qasim Faidbakhsh. # Massacre of Nurbakshi in Kashmir # The dominance of Sunni Islam in Kashmir after the period of Nurbakshi influence three was restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent Fiqh al-ahwat to the Sunni ' ulema for their analysis which resulted a condemnatory fatwa by the ' ulema in order to annihilate the Nurbakshi order , and cleanse Kashmir . Mir Danial shaheed and other great personalities were killed . The onslought against the Nurbakshia led to much bloodshed and much decimation of the once popular order . # Baltistan # The Nurbakshi people survived much longer in Baltistan which was after all an extremely remote region . There is little doubt that the Nurbakhshia order spread in Baltistan . After Twelver Shiism but following the pattern of Iran and Kashmir , the latter has gradually absorbed the former a puzzling question remains how and at what time the transformation from Noorbakhshis to Shiism took place in the valley of Skardu , the political center of Baltistan.While the 16th century Shardu rulers Ghazi Mir and Ali Sher Khan Anchan are generally being portrayed as Shia , in history books Noorbakhshis point at the construction of a large Khanah in Gamba near Skardu as late as 1717 to prove their strong presence in the Skardu valley at that time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are belongs to noorbakshi sect while a note-able size of nurbakshi Muslims are settled in different cities of Pakistan like Karachi , Islamabad , lahore , Peshawar and Quetta etc. where they have their own mosque and Marissa .

8572514 other=CTA and Pace buses OaktonSkokie is a rapid transit station on the Chicago Transit Authority 's Yellow Line , which serves Skokie 's downtown . Previously , a station existed at this location which was in operation as part of the CTA 's Niles Center Route from 1925 until 1948 , and later demolished in 1964 . The current station opened on April 30 , 2012. # History # In the 1920s , both the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and the North Shore Line ( an interurban railroad linking Chicago and Milwaukee ) existed under the private ownership of Samuel Insull . The North Shore Line 's original route to Milwaukee ran through numerous North Shore communities that had become densely settled . In order to provide faster service between Chicago and Milwaukee , the North Shore Line decided to build a high-speed bypass several miles west of its original line . The new route would traverse the Skokie Valley and converge with the ' L ' at Howard . In an attempt to encourage development in the village of Niles Center on the southern portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit service as far as Dempster Street . The new Niles Center Route included several intermediate stations served only by the Chicago Rapid Transit Company , including one at Oakton Street , just a few blocks from the intersection of Lincoln Avenue and Oakton Street where the business district of Niles Center was forming . Arthur U. Gerber , staff architect for Samuel Insull , designed the station in the Prairie School style , similar to the Dempster station at the end of the line . The station at Oakton was smaller and set between the tracks , with a single high-level island platform projecting from the rear of the station house . The line entered operation on March 28 , 1925 , but did not encourage much development before the Great Depression and World War II put a halt to building activity for nearly 20 years . The Niles Center service remained unprofitable in 1947 when the privately owned Chicago Rapid Transit Company was subsumed into the public Chicago Transit Authority , and on March 27 , 1948 , rapid transit service was terminated and replaced with the #97 Skokie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , except for Dempster where North Shore Line service continued until the company went out of business in 1963 . On Monday , April 20 , 1964 , the Chicago Transit Authority reinstated service on the Niles Center Branch as a nonstop shuttle between Howard and Dempster , dubbed the Skokie Swift . No station was located at Oakton , even though it is only one block from Skokie 's central business district . # Reconstruction # Since the Swift began operating in 1964 , there has been interest on the part of the Village of Skokie and its citizens to reestablish at least one of the local stations . The most likely candidate to return was Oakton because of its location near Skokie 's downtown and its potential to generate the most traffic . A study commissioned by the Village of Skokie and completed in Fall 2003 recommended establishing a stop at Oakton . Village officials discussed and planned for a downtown Skokie Swift station for more than five years . More recently , # Style and design # In early 2005 , the village received $417,000 in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers about 80 percent of design costs for the station . The village would pick up the remainder , about $104,000 , according to Village Director of Engineering Fred Schattner . Then , in mid-2005 , village staff submitted a grant proposal to the federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality grant program , which provides funds for projects that contribute to traffic congestion relief and cleaner air quality . In late November 2005 , the Skokie secured a $1 million federal grant for the village 's downtown Skokie Swift project with the help of U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D-9th . Then , in early December 2005 , Skokie learned they would receive an additional $9.2 million in federal grant funds to construct the station . The entire project is estimated to cost about $15 million including any land acquisition needed , which means the village had by this time secured more than two-thirds of the funding . Skokie Mayor Van Dusen has said he is exploring options to help pay for some or all of the remaining cost . # Location # The station is located on the site of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of Oakton Street and adjacent to the new Illinois Science + Technology Park . The village sought proposals from firms for design work for the new station , eventually awarding the contract to McDonough Associates . Construction of the new downtown station was expected to begin in 2007 and officials estimated the station would be completed in 2007 or 2008 . Issues of financing delayed the project as various funding sources were secured , and later issues of land acquisition delayed the project further . Finally in 2007 after extensive deliberation , the Village of Skokie initiated eminent domain proceedings against two landowners ( an auto repair shop and a truck rental business ) to make room adjacent to the station for a kiss and ride area , a bus turnaround and a taxi drop-off area . A groundbreaking ceremony took place at the adjacent Illinois Science + Technology Park on June 21 , 2010 . On June 8 , 2011 , the Chicago Transit Board revealed that the name of the station would be ' ' OaktonSkokie ' ' . Naming of the station was done concurrently with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Facilities # The station consists of an island platform at grade level located between the Yellow Line 's two tracks ; the eastern track serves trains to Dempster-Skokie , while the western track serves trains to Howard .

Volunteer Squadron A troopers served in the Puerto Rican Campaign in 1898 , and in 1916 the entire Squadron was called into federal service to patrol the Mexican Border and to support the Pancho Villa Expedition . During World War I , 796 Squadron A members served , and 609 became commissioned officers . As part of the 105th Machine Gun Battalion , the Squadron played an important role in the smashing of the Hindenburg Line . Members were highly decorated , including a Medal of Honor recipient . In World War II the unit was federalized as the 101st Cavalry , Horse/Mechanized in early 1941 . Following Pearl Harbor , Squadron A men served in all branches of the armed forces worldwide , and two additional Medals of Honor were earned in addition to an array of other distinctions . # Social activities # In peacetime both between the Wars and directly following , the Squadron was the focus of active social life .

Squadron A memorabilia is maintained in a museum at the Staten Island armory of the 101st Cavalry ( Tank ) , NYARNG , the successor unit to the Squadron , at 321 Manor Road , Castleton Corners , Staten Island . The 101st was one of the first military units to respond to the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 aiding both citizens and police and have been mobilized in support of the Global War on Terror and Operation Iraqi Freedom .

Pockmarks were discovered off the coasts of Nova Scotia , Canada in the late 1960s by Lew King and Brian McLean of the Bedford Institute of Oceanography . As pockmarks are uncommon on the land surface , they are expected in the ocean . They were discovered off Nova Scotia , using a new side scan sonar developed in the late 1960s by Kelvin Hughes . **6;721;br The craters off Nova Scotia are up to 150 m in diameter and 10 m deep . Pockmarks have been found worldwide . Discovery was aided by the use of high-resolution multibeam acoustic systems for bathymetric mapping . In these cases , pockmarks have been interpreted as the morphological expression of gas or oil leakage from active hydrocarbon system or a deep overpressured petroleum reservoir .

8837514 Donald Alywn Innis , ( born in 1931 in Olean , New York ) , is an American architect based in San Diego , California . Innis is also an inventor and engineer and has pioneered the idea of floating real estate , specifically the notion of a floating airport using pneumatic stabilized platform ( PSP ) technology which he has developed and patented through his company , Float Incorporated . Innis designed several notable San Diego landmarks , including the 1970s remodeling of the San Diego Broadway Pier ( one of the first pier designs to make use of significant above water landscaping and greenery ) , the master plan for the San Diego Embarcadero , and Terminal One of the San Diego International airport . He is a long-standing member of the American Institute of Architects . # Biography # # Early life # Innis is the middle son of Greta Matson Innis ( Swedish-American , b. 07/08/1905 , d. 05/05/1965 ) and Alwyn Osman Innis ( American , b. 03/04/1896 , d. 12/20/1974 ) . His father Alwyn was an American-born RCAF squadron leader during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RFC 's No. 46 Squadron during World War I in England from 1917 through 1918 . Alwyn Osman Innis had trained at Canada 's RFC camp at Bourden before being commissioned and sent to England . A.O. Innis returned to the U.S. when he left the RFC ( then the RAF ) in 1919 as a Second Lieutenant to become vice president and general manager of the Columbus Aviation Company . # Early career # In 1949 at age 18 , Donald A. Innis attended the University of Illinois in Chicago for one year before becoming a salesman and taking part in the racing of midget cars for Four Wheels Inc. ( a Chicago auto leasing firm ) . Innis would race midget and stock cars on the quarter mile track at Soldier Field in downtown Chicago and would sell used cars for the company . Innis then moved to Tucson , where he briefly attended the University of Arizona . Innis worked for Chicago architect Maurice Webster , ( b Sept. 20 , 1892 ; d May 17 , 1982 , Evanston , IL. ) who with architect Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had originally opened in 1929 just north of Chicago . Webster also designed Stronghold Castle , a replica of a European castle which was built by Walter Strong , then publisher of the Chicago Daily News . It is now a conference center owned by the local presbytery of the Presbyterian Church . Innis later moved to California with his younger brother , artist and writer W. Joe Innis . Impressed by the look and the scope of the beautiful San Francisco horizon , Innis settled in the Bay Area . In California , Innis went to work for Falkon Booth architects in San Francisco . Innis worked his way up the ladder quickly at Falkon Booth , becoming a draftsman and then drafting designer , when around 1956 he received notice that he had been drafted by the U. S. Army for two different service calls . Innis had previously served seven and a half years in the Navy Reserve , beginning shortly after high school . While a Navy reservist working on airplanes , Innis accidentally fell off a wing of an airplane , injured his back and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was not filed and Innis was unable to get a medical discharge from the Navy . The orders for Innis to return to duty came from the Army looking for recruits for the front line of the army infantry and ( in a technical mishap ) a duplicate order requesting Innis ' presence on an Army operated cable ship in Alaska by the U.S. Army Signal Corp 's Alaska Communications System ( ACS ) . Innis chose to honor the request to ship to Alaska and oversaw the laying of thousands of miles of the first military submarine telephone communication cables across the ocean using secret military charts aboard the wooden-hulled self-propelled barge , the cable ship Col. Basil O. Lenoir . Innis ' top secret job required him to enter a room like Oz and close curtains around him while he read the secret charts of where U.S. military communications cables would be laid at sea . After serving in the Signal Corps , Innis obtained an early release and entered U.C. Berkeley 's architecture program in 1958 . While studying at Berkeley , Innis taught sailing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed with Hans Albert Einstein ( son of physicist Albert Einstein ) , a professor of hydraulic engineering , who was teaching at the university at the time . Innis graduated from Cal in 1961. # Career highlights # In 1961 Innis moved to Southern California , where he was joined by his parents . That same year he joined the San Diego based architecture firm of Paderewski Mitchell and Dean , AIA , as chief designer . While working for C. J. Pat Paderewski , Innis was in charge of designing the current Terminal One at the San Diego Airport ( constructed in 1967 ) . Paderewski ( called San Diego 's Mr. Architect ) Paderewski had designed the first exterior all-glass elevator for San Diego 's El Cortez hotel ( the elevator has since been demolished ) . Paderewski was then president of the San Diego Chapter of the American Institute of Architects , which Innis would also later head . In 1965 , Innis decided to form his own firm , Donald Innis &amp; Associates . In 1966 Innis submitted the winning proposal in a competition for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple arches . However , the arcades were never built using Innis ' design ; the job was awarded to another architect many years later . A year later , Innis was joined by fellow architect Dave Tennebaum , and the firm was renamed Innis-Tennebaum Architects Inc. , AIA . For more than three decades Innis-Tennebaum Architects specialized in military contracts and the building of elementary schools , residential , commercial and other architectural projects . Noteworthy projects in and around San Diego included the original Del Mar 's Flower Hill Mall ( built in 1977 for the Fletcher family ) which included an underground restaurant , East Village Mall ( Rancho Santa Fe ) , a total overhaul and remodeling of the historic Broadway Pier adding new innovative structures ( and preserving the view of the bay all the way down Broadway Street ) , The Harbor Seafood Mart at the Embarcadero , and the redesign of the Red Sails Inn on Shelter Island . In 1992 , Innis retired from Innis-Tennebaum to create Float Inc. and pursue his dream project of a floating airport . # Floating Airport # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's airport , Innis realized that the airport could not expand to meet future needs while at its current location . The new site would need to be close to the current airport and population centers and accessible . There was only one answer . It would need to be built on the water . To achieve a platform large enough to operate an international airport ( about 1,200 acres ) , the technology needed to be invented to float that kind of structure . A concrete structure using air for buoyancy became the PSP patent . In 1992 , Float , Incorporated was founded by Innis and three partners to develop this plan . The PSP technology Innis invented uses air movement to reduce wave loads and distribute them through the platform , a platform that could be used to house offshore airports , oil and gas production facilities , floating islands , military bases , and additional real estate for coastal cities . The technology enables the platform to extract energy from ocean waves to create electricity and is less costly than most currently used large open ocean platforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division took an interest in the PSP 's potential to serve as a floating military base and awarded Float Inc. a $1.5 million contract with the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency ( DARPA ) in August 1995 to test PSP . Extensive numerical modeling was performed along with two series of wave tank tests . The second series of tests at 1/48th scale was focused on air exchange . A final scientific report on the test results was submitted to the Office of Naval Research ( ONR ) in December 2000 . The floating airport for San Diego has been dismissed as outlandish , logistically ludicrous , impractical and expensive . The idea has not found favor with San Diego authorities , although Innis and his associates at Float Inc. continue to pursue the idea . # Personal life # On July 5 , 1962 , Innis married teacher and flower designer , Virginia Maples ( formerly Pasto ) . He helped raise her two sons from a previous marriage , John and Jim Pasto , who were teenagers at the time . The couple had three children of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cynthia Ona Innis . Virginia Innis died in February 2007 from injuries resulting from a single car accident in Point Loma , San Diego . She is buried at El Camino Memorial Park in San Diego . Don Innis still resides in San Diego and continues his passion for sailing . He is a longtime member of the San Diego Yacht Club . Innis continues to work every day at Float Inc. striving to realize the dream of a floating airport and/or floating real estate .

The Teesdale Way long-distance footpath , the Tees Valley Line , the B6541 ( Old A66/A67 , Stockton Road ) and the A66 pass under the bridge on the southern bank of the Tees . The bridge was built with sufficient clearance to allow ships to pass , although the port of Stockton-on-Tees up-river was virtually redundant by then . Since the Tees Newport Bridge had its lifting deck permanently fixed in the down position in 1990 , large shipping can no longer reach the Tees viaduct , further reducing the need for such a high structure . The bridge was constructed from 1973 to 1975 and opened in 1975 . It is made of reinforced concrete piles , steel-plate girders and a composite deck and is the largest such bridge in the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge was opened and repairs have been necessary at times . Expansion joints were cracking and allowing de-icing salts to wash from the bridge carriageway into the piers , cross beams and columns giving rise to extensive chloride attack and it was decided the best solution was the complete demolition and reconstruction of most of the piers and repair of others . The bridge now carries some 70,000 vehicles a day and there are concerns that the capacity of the road is being exceeded at peak times Because of this CCTV cameras were installed on the bridge to record incident related congestion and respond more quickly . In 2006 the detailed principal inspection report concluded that the Tees Viaduct is overall in fair condition . # References #

The shrine is the second most photographed landmark in Pennsylvania , behind the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia . # History # The Nittany Lion Shrine at Pennsylvania State University was dedicated on October 24 , 1942 during Homecoming . Animalier Heinz Warneke and stonecutter Joseph Garatti created it from a 13-ton block of Indiana Limestone . The shrine was chosen from six models submitted by Warneke . The shrine is a gift of the class of 1940 and rests in a natural setting of trees near Recreation Building . In 2013 the shrine was renovated to improve the lighting , add a sidewalk , and add large decorative stones .

8925514 An eligible bachelor is a bachelor considered to be a particularly desirable potential husband , usually due to wealth , or social status . In the United Kingdom , the heir to the throne or someone close in succession is often considered to be the nation 's , or the world 's most eligible bachelor , due to their social status , as has happened with Prince Charles and Prince William . Jane Austen 's novels are often concerned with the heroine 's relationship with an eligible bachelor . Jane Austen 's ' ' Emma ' ' particularly concerns a woman 's attempt to obtain a husband for her friend by embellishing the truth . The gentleman in that case sees it as an example of the matchmaker 's creativity and falls in love with her . # Homosexuals as ' ' apparent ' ' eligible bachelors # During the 1950s and 1960s , Rock Hudson was hailed as an eligible bachelor . In the past , if a man chose to remain an eligible bachelor for long he may have been suspected of being homosexual , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bachelor ' ' a role closeted gay men may have played . The term ' confirmed bachelor ' has fallen from common usage , as past life patterns involving marriage , divorce and prolonged bachelorhood have been altered for men since the advent of the sexual revolution and the marriage strike . # Sociology # Robin Lakoff argues that the term indicates an inequality between men and women , as an eligible bachelor chooses to be a bachelor , whereas an eligible spinster does not have a choice . Lakoff believes this use of language fosters , and grows from , sexual discrimination . Lakoff states women are given their identity in our society by virtue of their relationship with men , and not vice versa.

8953514 A few years ago a new piece of liturgy was created to commemorate the Shoah and give Jews around the world a standard text to use each year on Yom Hashoah . Megillat Hashoah ( the Holocaust scroll ) presented a six chapter account of those dark days in a small booklet . Jews throughout the ages have told their stories using parchment and quills and so Sofer STaM Marc Michaels was commissioned by the former Rabbi of Brighton Synagogue to turn this booklet into a kasher scroll that could be read by the community on Yom Hashoah . Drawing on the power of the letters and scribal traditions to create a visual Midrash that adds further depth and meaning to the text , the scroll has been turned into a tikkun - a copyists guide - explaining the journey of the booklet to scroll and detailing the rules so that scribes over the world may create scrolls .

It originates in the northern part of the county , passes through the Town of Greenfield and the Town of Milton , and serves as the boundary between the City of Saratoga Springs and the Town of Malta before emptying into Saratoga Lake . The Mohawk tribe of the Iroquois Five Nations used the associated valley as a summer hunting and fishing destination . They named the creek ' ' Kayaderosseras ' ' ( which translates into Valley of the Crooked Stream ) due to its tortuous course and dramatic drop in elevation . An 1887 source says that the name was derived from French terms , a Mohawk corruption of either ' ' pay arros ' ' , a watered country , or ' ' pay des ruisseaux ' ' , a country of streams , adapted by the Mohawk when they pushed out the previous inhabitants , the Mahican , in the 1600s .

9098514 The Animalize Tour was a concert tour by American band Kiss in support of their ' ' Animalize ' ' album . It was divided into two halves : the European leg and the U.S. leg , with two very different shows and stage sets . The European staging was essentially the Unmasked Tour stage , decorated to resemble the ' ' Animalize ' ' album cover ( amps painted with leopard spots and tiger stripes ) . One short-lived prop saw two growling panthers covering Eric Carr 's bass drums . When ' ' Animalize ' ' became a surprise hit in America , a much larger stage set was designed for the American leg of the tour by Tait Towers . The shows would start much in the same manner as the Dynasty show , with the band being lifted onto the stage by a lift behind the drum riser . Sound effects of a large airplane landing would be played over the speakers while the band was coming up , and after the famous You Wanted The Best intro the band would launch into Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kulick on lead guitar , replacing Mark St. John who could n't play due to his arthritic condition . Originally Kulick was a temporary replacement , but St. John 's condition did not improve , and Kulick was named an official member on December 8 , 1984 . Bon Jovi was the opening act on the European leg , with Queensrche , WASP and Krokus opening shows in North America . The ' ' Animalize ' ' period was the band 's most successful of the decade with the crossover success of Heaven 's on Fire onto CHR/Top 40 radio , a very well-attended concert trek , and with ' ' Animalize ' ' selling nearly 2 million copies by the end of the tour . # Tour notes # * I 've Had Enough ( Into The Fire ) , Get All You Can Take and Burn Bitch Burn were all performed at the opening show in Brighton , England . Get All You Can Take would never be performed live again , while I 've Had Enough ( Into The Fire ) would continue to make sporadic appearances through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be performed only once , being played on opening night . *Eric Carr would handle lead vocals on Young and Wasted at all shows .

The intended specific target market for the Official Police was mainly law enforcement agencies and it became one of the best selling police firearms of all time , eventually in the 1950s coming to exemplify typical peace officer weaponry . The Official Police was also used by various U.S. and allied military forces during World War II . # Development and history # As the 20th Century began , the older .32 caliber revolvers which had been standard-issue for the majority of American police departments began to be phased out in favor of the larger-bore .38 caliber . In 1908 Colt introduced a sleek and modernized revolver they dubbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ) and popular .38 Special quickly became the issue service revolver of many departments . During the same period , revolvers began to fall out of favor with the U.S. Military , especially after the adoption on the U.S. Model of 1911 semi-automatic pistol . As military sales of their revolvers dropped off , Colt searched for an alternative market and realized the popularity and strong sales of their product line with civilian law enforcement agencies could form their replacement market . By 1927 the overwhelming sales of two popular models , the Army Special and Colt Police Positive , had assured Colts dominance of the law enforcement firearms market . Colts marketing strategy was further fine-tuned by making a few superficial alterations to the Army Special revolver and then renaming it as the Official Police model . The changes included adding checkering to the trigger and cylinder latch , matting the topstrap of the frame and widening the rear sight groove . Colt also upgraded the quality of the guns finish from a dull blued finish to a highly polished blued surface . In 1930 , Colt scored a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could easily handle the firing of heavily-loaded .38 rounds intended for competitor Smith &amp; Wesson 's new large N-frame revolver , the .38-44 , none of the comparable S&amp;W revolvers could manage this feat . By 1933 the Colt sales catalog listed many law enforcement agencies as having adopted the OP as a sidearm , including the New York City , Los Angeles , Chicago , and Kansas City police departments . In addition many state police organizations and even the Federal Bureau of Investigation chose the OP as their issue revolver . The U.S. Army also bought some of the revolvers , issuing them to military police and to federal agencies in need of a revolver for their armed agents , such as the Treasury Department , Coast Guard , and the Postal Inspection Service . Many Official Police revolvers were also bought by the police forces and militaries of various South American countries . Between May 1940 and June 1941 , 49,764 Official Police revolvers in .38 New Police or .38/200 caliber were purchased by the British Purchasing Commission and shipped to the United Kingdom for use by British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These revolvers bore British military acceptance markings and had a 5 barrel ; the butt was fitted with a military-style lanyard ring . Most of these OP revolvers were assembled from commercial-grade parts made before 1942 . When the U.S. became involved in World War II , the U.S. government requested contracts to supply .38 revolvers required for arming security personnel charged with the security of government buildings , shipyards , and defense plant installations against sabotage or theft . Commencing in 1941 , small quantities of the .38 Colt Official Police were procured directly from the Defense Supplies Corporation ( DSC ) . When government purchasing officials objected to production delays of the OP , as well as the unit cost , Colt responded by simplifying the gun . Savings were achieved by eliminating all unnecessary exterior polishing operations , substituting a smooth-face trigger and hammer , and fitting the gun with simplified checkered wood grips with the Colt medallion ; the latter was soon replaced by ' Coltwood ' molded plastic grips . Instead of the normal bluing , the revolver was given a dull parkerized finish . Dubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was primarily used to arm units of Military police , security guards at U.S. defense plant installations and shipyards , as well as limited clandestine issue to agencies involved in overseas espionage and military intelligence . In mid-1942 the Springfield Ordnance District ( SOD ) was given control over procurement and distribution of the Commando , which transferred the revolvers to the end user . A few Commandos were shipped to the U.S. Maritime Commission and used as small arms equipment on U.S. merchant ships and ships provided to the Allies under Lend-Lease . Most Commando wartime production went to the Defense Supplies Corporation ( DSC ) . for use by security and police forces , while approximately 1,800 Commandos were used by the U.S. Navy , with another 12,800 revolvers distributed to various military intelligence agencies . Control over procurement changed in 1944 , after the DSC formally objected to being charged additional handling fees by the armed forces , and was then authorized to procure the Commando directly from Colt . After the Allied victory , Colt resumed commercial production and returned to the prewar polished blued finish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1954 when the checkered wooden grips were reintroduced . During the postwar period , Colt fell on difficult financial times and the company introduced few new models . At Smith &amp; Wesson , both output and new model civilian and police sales improved , and the sales margin gap between the two corporations progressively tightened . Finally in the 1960s S&amp;W took over the lead . A contributing factor to this change may have been Smith &amp; Wesson 's generally lower cost per unit , accompanied by a double-action trigger pull on their military &amp; police model that was preferred by many agencies teaching the new combat-oriented double-action revolver training . Colt announced the discontinuation of the Official Police in 1969 , stating that competitive production of the design was no longer economically feasible . With a total production of over 400,000 pistols , the Official Police ranks as one of the most successful handguns ever made . # Features # The Official Police was machined of fine carbon steel , with bright royal Colt blued as well as nickel plated finishes , and was offered in 4 , 5and6 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was manufactured in a variety of chamberings including .22 LR , .32-20 ( discontinued in 1942 ) , .41 Long Colt ( discontinued in 1938 ) , and the most common and popular , the .38 Special .

The pistols sights consisted of a blade front with a fixed iron open rear sight , which was a simple V-notch shaped groove milled into the revolvers top strap . The top strap had a matte finish to reduce glare down the sight plane . # Variants # # Commando # The Commando was a wartime variant of the Official Police , manufactured with either a two or four inch barrel , and incorporating several production economies including a non-gloss Parkerized finish .

Of this total , approximately 12,800 Commando revolvers were issued to various intelligence services such as US Military intelligence and the Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) . Many of the latter were procured with the two-inch barrel , referred to as the Junior Commando . Regular production deliveries of two-inch Junior Commando revolvers began in March 1943 , at approximately serial number 9,000 . More than 12,000 of the two-inch Commandos encountered today are actually postwar conversions from four-inch models produced during the war . # Marshal # A rare variant featuring a rounded grip , with barrel lengths of two and four inches .

9291514 The Sturgeon-Weir River is a river in east-central Saskatchewan , Canada . It flows about 130 km south-southeast to join the Saskatchewan River at Cumberland House , Saskatchewan . It was on the main voyageur route from eastern Canada northeast to the Mackenzie River basin . The river is a popular wilderness canoe route in Canada . # Description # The river 's source is Corneille Lake , near the community of Pelican Narrows . It travels in a southeast direction , crossing Saskatchewan Highway 106 before reaching Amisk Lake . It then continues southeasterly to Sturgeon Landing and Namew Lake . It runs through the Churchill River Uplands ecoregion which is located along the southern edge of the Precambrian Shield . The area contains continuous coniferous and boreal forest , consisting of closed stands of black spruce and jack pine and a ground cover of mosses and lichens .

It has been used since prehistoric times and archeological digs have uncovered pottery dating to 1100 CE . The first European to explore the river may have been Hudson Bay Company fur trader Isaac Batt in the winter of 1766-67 . In 1776 Alexander Henry with Joseph Frobisher , Thomas Frobisher , and J.B. Cadotte travelled up the river from Cumberland House and established a fort at the river 's outlet from Amisk Lake , called Fort Beaver Lake . This became the preferred fur trade route connecting the Saskatchewan River system to northern Canada .

He took part in Central Television 's ' ' New Faces ' ' in 1988 and has featured on the BBC television magazine programme ' ' Inside Out ' ' .

9795514 : ' ' This article refers to the horse race track . For other uses , see The Meadows ( disambiguation ) . ' ' The Meadows Racetrack and Casino is a standardbred harness racing track and slot machine casino in North Strabane Township near Meadow Lands , Washington County , Pennsylvania , United States . The facility is located between U.S. Route 19 and Interstate 79 , 5 mi north of Washington , Pennsylvania , United States and 25 mi south of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , United States . # History # In November 1962 , ground was broken for the first parimutuel horse racing track in Western Pennsylvania . The track opened on June 28 , 1963 and was operated by the Washington Trotting Association . The Washington Trotting Association was purchased in February 1973 by a group including famous trainer/driver Delvin Miller . Miller 's imprint still exists on the track today , with The Meadows most prestigious race bearing his name ( the Delvin Miller Adios Pace for the Orchids ) , and a statue of his famous sire Adios located at the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum Commission erected a historical marker at The Meadows to note Miller 's historic importance . The Meadows introduced two significant technological advancements in 1983 : Call-A-Bet and the Meadows Racing Network ( MRN ) . Call-A-Bet allowed users to create individual wagering accounts and phone in wagers for races . In conjunction , the Meadows Racing Network telecast each day 's live races and was distributed to local cable providers . The telecast also included a half hour preview show hosted by track announcer Roger Huston . The track used a marketing campaign to promote the services with the slogan Every 16 minutes the place goes crazy , alluding to the typically quick pace from race-to-race at harness tracks . Pittsburgh lawyer Stuart A. Williams purchased the track in 1986 , and subsequently sold it to England-based Ladbroke Group PLC in 1988 . The company changed the name to Ladbroke at the Meadows and opened a series of off-track betting parlors named Ladbrokes . The first opened in New Castle , Pennsylvania , United States in June 1990 . Locations followed in Greensburg , Johnstown , Pennsylvania , Harmar Township @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , United States ) . The Greensburg location was closed in 2000 following the decline and eventual vacancy of the Greengate shopping mall at which it was located . The Johnstown , Pennsylvania location was later sold to the Penn National Gaming corporation in July 1998 . All other locations currently remain operational . Magna Entertainment Corp leased the track from Ladbroke in 2001 . Magna transformed Call-A-Bet into Xpressbet , an internet and telephone based wagering service that allowed users to not only wager on The Meadows , but also on numerous other tracks owned by Magna or with whom a business agreement was in place . The Meadows was also featured on HRTV , a cable television station part-owned by Magna . The OTB names were changed to The Meadows- ' ' location ' ' ( e.g. The Meadows-Harmar ) . Another Greensburg OTB location was opened in 2004 but closed in 2007 . The Meadows-West Mifflin also closed it doors in April 2012 . Las Vegas based Cannery Casino Resorts purchased the track in July 2006 . Magna was retained to operate the track under a five year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian company , agreed to purchase both Cannery 's casino assets as well as The Meadows . However , in March 2009 Crown backed out of the deal . In May 2014 , Cannery agreed to sell The Meadows to Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc . ( GLPI ) for $465 million . GLPI said that it would retain ownership of the real estate , while a third-party company would operate the facility . # Casino # Legislation passed in the state of Pennsylvania in July 2004 included The Meadows among the locations slated to obtain a gambling license for slot machines . The legislation upheld a 2005 legal challenge by gambling opponents , and on September 27 , 2006 , The Meadows was awarded a gaming license by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board . On November 16 , 2006 , The Meadows broke ground on construction . Plans called for initial construction of a temporary casino adjacent to the track , which opened on June 11 , 2007 . On September 5 , 2007 , a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the grandstand removal , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent casino opened on April 15 , 2009 ; the temporary building was also closed on this date . Amenities include a 350000sqft m2 casino , food court , cafe restaurant , premier steakhouse with view of the race track , covered grandstand , simulcast viewing area , VIP boxes , and a 24 lane state-of-the-art bowling center . The Meadows features over 3,300 slot machines . On July 6 , 2010 , The Meadows Casino hosted an invite only test date for casino table games . The test runs were successful , and at 6 AM on July 8 , 2010 , the table games ( including roulette , blackjack , craps , etc. ) opened to the general public . The chips used by the Meadows Casino are RFID chips that have a special microchip inside of them , that broadcasts to the table that it is a legit chip . This measure prevents fake or forged chips from entering into the play area . The cost per chip is slightly higher than normal chips , but has less chance of being counterfeited. # Physical Attributes # The race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the standard harness race distance is one mile ( 1610 m ) , races start on the backstretch and proceed through three turns . The original track surface was made of Tartan , a synthetic material manufactured by Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing ( 3M ) . As problems with Tartan surfaces began to emerge , the surface was changed to a more traditional stone dust . The track has no hub rail ( inner portion is marked by pylons ) . The stretch is 566 feet ( 173 m ) in length , and 80 feet ( 24 m ) in width . There is an inside passing lane in the stretch , referred to as the Lightning Lane . # Racing # Unlike many other tracks in the United States , The Meadows conducts racing year round , with over 200 days of the year featuring live racing .

9830514 Cardiff Docks is a port in southern Cardiff , Wales . At its peak , the port was one of the largest dock systems in the world with a total quayage of almost 11km mi . Once the main port for the export of South Wales coal , the Port of Cardiff remains active in the import and export of containers , steel , forest products and dry and liquid bulks. # History # Following the development of the coal found in the Cynon and Rhondda valley 's and Merthyr area of South Wales , the export of both coal and iron products required a sea connection to the Bristol Channel if economic volumes of product were to be created . In 1794 , the Glamorganshire Canal was completed , linking the then small town of Cardiff with Merthyr , and in 1798 a basin was built , connecting the canal to the sea . By the 1830s , Cardiff became the pre-eminent iron-exporting port , shipping almost half of British overseas iron exports ; between 1840 and 1870 , the volume of coal exports increased from 44,350 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation for proper dock facilities led Cardiff 's foremost landowner , John Crichton-Stuart , 2nd Marquess of Bute , to promote the construction of the ( West ) Bute Dock , designed by Admiral William Henry Smyth and opened in October 1839 . Just two years later , the Taff Vale Railway was opened , following much the same route as the canal . With the construction of the new East Bute Dock from 1855 , designed by James Walker of Messrs . Walker &amp; Burges and built by Thomas Cubitt 's firm , its opening in 1859 resulted in coal supplanting iron as the industrial foundation of South Wales , with exports reaching 2 million tons as early as 1862. # Queen Alexandra Dock # Frustration at the lack of development at Cardiff led to rival docks being opened at Penarth in 1865 and Barry , Wales in 1889 . These developments eventually spurred Cardiff into action , with the opening of the Roath Dock in 1887 , and the Queen Alexandra Dock in 1907 . By then , coal exports from the South Wales Coalfield via Cardiff totalled nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the holds of locally-owned tramp steamers . By 1913 , this had risen to 10,700,000 tons , making Cardiff the biggest coal exporting dock in the world . # Shipping # Cardiff 's first steamship was the Llandaff of 1865 , and by 1910 , there were some 250 tramp steamers owned at Cardiff , by prominent firms such as William Cory &amp; Son , Morel , Evan Thomas Radcliffe , Tatem and Reardon-Smith . Each day , the principals of these companies would meet to arrange cargoes of coal for their ships in the opulent Coal Exchange in Mount Stuart Square . This trade reached its pinnacle in 1913 , when 10.7 million tons of coal were exported from the port . After the First World War , there was a boom in shipping in Cardiff , with 122 shipping companies in existence in 1920 . The boom proved short-lived , however ; oil was growing in importance as a maritime fuel , and the terms of the Treaty of Versailles soon flooded Europe with cheap German reparation coal . # Railways # The Taff Vale Railway was built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ docks . Its headquarters were a currently derelict building in Cardiff Bay railway station . The building was turned into a railway heritage centre in 1979 by the Butetown Historic Railway Society . By 1994 the Society had started to run steam locomotive hauled passenger services up and down 500 metres of track . However , as the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation had no interest in the railway , the Society changed its name to the Vale of Glamorgan Railway and moved from the site in 1997 to Barry Island railway station . # Decline # From 1910 onwards capacity issues meant that the more modern and less tidal Barry Docks took over as the largest volume export point of coal . Until the early 1920s , Cardiff docks continued to boom as a location for shipping companies , but the fall in demand for Welsh coal caused a dramatic fall in exports . By 1932 , in the depths of the Great Depression which followed the General Strike in 1926 , coal exports had fallen to below 5 million tonnes and dozens of locally owned ships were laid-up . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the attentions of the Nazi German Luftwaffe during the Cardiff Blitz , coal exports continued to decline , finally ceasing in 1964 . In 1950 , imports outstripped exports for the first time in the port 's history . The 1970s saw a short-term import boom , and in the 1980s the port experienced a slight rise in traffic , while much of the former port area began to be regenerated into non-port uses . The port found a niche as an important local centre for general cargo operations . # Modern Port Facilities # Cardiff now has three operational docks capable of handling ships of up to 35,000 tons deadweight . The port has transit sheds with 258500m2 sqft of storage space , two overland distribution sheds totalling 13870m2 sqft , and two timber sheds totalling 13870m2 sqft , two specialist steel sheds , with overhead gantry cranes , totalling 15000m2 sqft . There are 9 quayside cranes plus a range of mobile cranes . Cardiff 's specialised facilities include a distribution terminal and chill and cold storage for perishables. # Tiger Bay # Tiger Bay was a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase deriving from the area 's rough-and-tumble reputation . Merchant seamen arrived in Cardiff from all over the world , only staying for as long as it took to discharge and reload their ships : consequently many murders and lesser crimes went unsolved and unpunished , the perpetrators having sailed for other ports . In Victorian times , the name Tiger Bay was used in popular literature and slang ( especially that of sailors ) to denote any dock or seaside neighborhood which shared a similar notoriety for danger . # Cardiff Bay # The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was created in 1987 to counter the effects of economic depression in this run-down area . Today , the port of Cardiff and what is now known as Cardiff Bay has been totally transformed by the Cardiff Barrage that impounds the Rivers Taff and the Ely to create a massive fresh-water lake across to Penarth Head . Only two docks , the Roath and the Queen Alexandra , remain in use , and just two shipping companies remain , albeit buoyant with their worldwide interests .

9883514 In vehicle acrobatics , a wheelie , or wheelstand , Wheelies appear in popular culture as early as 1943 , as U.S Army motorized cavalry are pictured in Life magazine performing high speed wheelies . Daredevil Evel Knievel performed motorcycle acrobatics including wheelies in his shows . Doug The Wheelie King Domokos has accomplished such feats as a 145 mi wheelie . # Types of wheelie # Types of wheelies can be divided into two broad categories : : 1 . wheelies in which the vehicle power is sufficient by itself , as described in the Physics section below . These include : : * Clutch wheelies - performed by disengaging the clutch and opening the throttle to let the engine race and then engaging the clutch abruptly . : * Power wheelies or roll-on wheelies - performed by simply opening the throttle . If the engine has sufficient power , it will be able to lift the front wheel . : 2. wheelies performed with the aid of suspension dynamics or rider motion . These include : : * Bounce wheelies or slap wheelies - performed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tire rebounding , rider motion , or any combination of the three . : * Manuals - performed without applying torque to the rear wheel at all , but instead by moving the rider 's body backwards relative to the bike , and then pulling back on the handlebars near the end of available travel . # Bicycles # Wheelies are a common stunt in artistic cycling and freestyle BMX . The bike is balanced by the rider 's weight and sometimes use of the rear brake . A style of bicycle , the wheelie bike , has a seating position , and thus center of mass , nearly over the rear wheel that facilitates performing wheelies . # Motorcycles # A wheelie is also a common motorcycle stunt . The principle is the same as the bicycle wheelie , but the throttle and rear-brakes are used to control the wheelie while a rider uses body weight and the steering to control the direction the inertia of the spinning front wheel acting as a balance . The world 's fastest motorcycle wheelie record is 307.86 km/h by Patrick Furstenhoff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast wheelie over 1kmmi 1 is 172.9 mph , set in September 2006 by Terry Calcott at Elvington airfield in Yorkshire , England . In some countries , such as the United Kingdom and USA , motorcyclists performing a wheelie on a public road may be prosecuted for dangerous driving , an offense which can carry a large fine and a ban of a year or more . In Pakistan , India , and some other countries its illegal to perform these kinds of stunts . If someone is caught performing these acts , they can have their motorcycle impounded and potentially face jail time . # Automobiles # Wheelies are common in auto- or motorcycle drag racing , where they represent torque wasted lifting the front end , rather than moving the vehicle forward . # Wheelie bars # Wheelie bars help prevent a vehicle 's front end from raising too high or flipping over . Wheelie bars are required for some tractor and truck pull events . <ref> cite web # Physics # A wheelie is imminent when the acceleration is sufficient to reduce the load borne by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Ski ( driving stunt ) * Stoppie * Weight transfer # Notes # de:Fahrtechnik#Auf dem Hinterrad fahren

4 Joan 's on Third is a specialty food marketplace and restaurant located on Third Street in Los Angeles , California . Joan 's is situated in an area popular with Angelenos for its eating and shopping establishments , located between the Beverly Center on La Cienega Boulevard and Farmer 's Market at the Grove on Fairfax Avenue . A family business owned and operated by chef Joan McNamara and her children , Joan 's started out as a catering operation running out of a storefront on Third St. As demand grew , McNamara expanded her business to include a small caf and marketplace . The store tripled its size after a decade of operation , and the restaurant now includes a full menu for breakfast , lunch and dinner . The shop in the same space sells artisan cheeses , prepared foods , baked goods , desserts and non-perishables . Its popularity and success has grown on the strength of its products and good reviews in multiple publications and media outlets . It also has a reputation as a hip gathering spot frequented by Hollywood celebrities and foodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zappa . When the lines get too long and customers are waiting , Joan has been known to rush out with a tray of cupcakes for everyone . # History # Joan McNamara , namesake of Joan 's , is a chef originally from New York , where she ran a cooking school and her own restaurant before moving to L.A. She opened Joan 's in 1995 as a catering company located in a storefront on West Third St. Joan 's two daughters , Carol , a graduate of the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration , and Susie , an alumna of the Georgetown University School of Business , also help run the business . San Francisco chef Chester Hastings came to work at the store in 1997 and eventually married Susie McNamara . In 1998 Joan 's expanded into an adjacent storefront on Third Street , helping to realize Ms. MacNamara 's lifelong dream of opening a gourmet foods marketplace and caf . Another major expansion took place in 2007 that helped expand the scope of the company 's operations by tripling the floor space of the market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-service restaurant providing table service and take-out meals for it patrons . Often very busy , Joan 's has been described as being reminiscent of some famous New York restaurants , including Zabar 's , Dean &amp; DeLuca , and Fairway Market . Joan 's has a full-service cheese counter stocked with artisan cheeses ; a dessert bar with baked goods , an assortment of chocolates and dessert bars ; and a prepared food counter where sandwiches are offered along with other ready-to-eat foods , salads and snacks . An assortment of dry goods and refrigerated products are also offered , and Joan 's sells gift baskets . The owners travel extensively to source products . # Reviews # The restaurant has generally been given favorable reviews in several publications and news outlets , including the ' ' New York Times ' ' , CNN and ' ' Time ' ' magazine . A ' ' Los Angeles Times ' ' review noted that Joan 's is the ' ' rare in LA specialty foods store ' ' that ' ' stocks essentials -- salt-cured anchovies sold by the ounce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a specialty sea salt from France ) , and imported De Cecco brand pasta ' ' and ' ' a small selection of carefully chosen cheeses , such as locally made burrata , English Cotswold , or a truffle-infused Boschetto. ' ' # Criticism # While the ' ' Los Angeles Times ' ' reviewer stated that the food was ' ' above average ' ' , she also noted that ' ' It &amp;#91 ; the restaurant&amp;#93 ; is somewhat disorganized . When there 's a rush ( i.e. , more than a handful of customers ) , the servers behind the counter can sometimes get flustered , and it seems to take longer than it should to put together an order . ' ' The Zagat Survey lists Joan 's as a Top Bakery in the US and the customer reviews posted on the website are mostly positive , with one poster calling Joan 's offerings ' ' fun and delicious , albeit expensive , snacks , cheeses , etc. ' ' ; however a couple of other commentators stated it is overrated and overpriced . Other customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , food quality , price and value . The ' ' Los Angeles Daily News ' ' Food Editor on LA.com noted the crowded conditions in Joan 's and warned that At busy times , it can be difficult to snag a table - and the frenetic pace and wait to order at the counter may not appeal to some . Parking is sometimes difficult to come by . The Metromix website also explained The seating is limited , and even if you do score a table , you 'll spend a lot of the meal being bumped by take-out patrons . # Celebrities # The company has been noted as being popular among several celebrities and gourmands who live in the southlands of California . Writing for ' ' The New York Times ' ' , Moon Zappa described Joan 's on Third as her favorite Los Angeles eatery . The restaurant is also a favorite of Jake Gyllenhaal , who has been seen dining there with ex-girlfriend Kirsten Dunst.

In 1928 , he was Liberal candidate at the by-election for the constituency of Ilford and fought the seat again in the general election of the following year . In 1930 , Comyns Carr published an influential and controversial booklet , ' ' Escape from the Dole ' ' , which gained him significant public attention .

4 The 2008 United States presidential election in Nebraska took place on November 4 , 2008 as part of the 2008 United States presidential election . Voters chose 5 electors to the Electoral College , who voted for President and Vice President . However , this state is one of the two states of the U.S. that , instead of giving all of its electors to the winner based on its statewide results , just 2 of them vote based on the statewide results , and the others vote based on their individual congressional district results . Nebraska , statewide , was not a swing state in 2008 . Located in the Great Plains of the United States , it is one of the most staunchly Republican states in the country . While some hypothetical general election match-up polls between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama showed the race to be seemingly close , they were largely regarded as outliers as more polls released showed McCain leading in double digits . McCain wound up carrying the popular vote in Nebraska by 14.93 points , taking in 56.53% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCain in Nebraska 's 2nd Congressional District , which contains Omaha and the surrounding areas . Due to Nebraska 's system of proportionally allocating electoral votes , Obama was able to win one electoral vote while John McCain received the state 's other four electoral votes . # Primaries &amp; caucuses # *Nebraska Democratic caucuses , 2008 *Nebraska Republican primary , 2008 # Campaign statewide # # Polling # McCain won every single pre-election poll . Since May , he won each poll by a double digit margin of victory and each with at least 52% of the vote . # Fundraising # John McCain raised a total of $678,059 in the state , while Barack Obama raised $864,393. # Advertising and visits # Obama spent $55,807 while McCain and the Republican Trust PAC spent a total of just $1,225 . Both Obama and McCain visited the state once . Obama held a downtown rally at Omaha and McCain traveled to both Omaha and Ashland . Palin also visited Omaha once . # Campaign in Omaha # Nebraska has two electoral votes that go to the winner of the popular vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on whichever candidate wins the popular vote in each of Nebraska 's three congressional districts , all of which have trended Republican in the past elections . However Nebraska 's 2nd Congressional District , based in the city of Omaha , is significantly less conservative . The second CD of Nebraska was actually considered as a battleground area by some , leading the Obama campaign to open a single campaign office in Omaha with 15 staff members to cover the congressional district in September 2008 . More than 900 people attended the opening of those offices . Democratic Mayor Mike Fahey of Omaha said that he would do whatever it takes to deliver the electoral vote tied to the 2nd Congressional District to Obama , and the Obama Campaign considered Nebraska 's 2nd congressional district in play . Former Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey and then senior U.S. Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama. # Analysis # Nebraska , part of the conservative Great Plains region , is one of the most Republican states in the nation . It has only gone Democratic in a presidential election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCain won the Cornhusker State by nearly 15 points . Obama was only able to win four counties : Douglas County , which contains Omaha ; Lancaster County , which contains the state capital of Lincoln and the University of Nebraska ; Saline County ; and Thurston County , which contains a Native American reservation and was the only county to be won by John Kerry in 2004 . No Democratic presidential nominee since Lyndon B. Johnson 's landslide 1964 victory has ever won more than four counties in Nebraska . In 2008 , McCain won Nebraska 's 1st Congressional District and Nebraska 's 3rd Congressional District by fairly safe margins , along with the state as a whole , but Obama managed to carry Nebraska 's 2nd Congressional District , based in Omaha , by a slim margin of 1,260 votes , resulting in one of Nebraska 's five electoral votes being awarded to Obama . This was a particularly notable win , because with Nebraska 's split electoral vote system Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win an electoral vote from Nebraska since 1964 . Obama did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Douglas and Lancaster . While John Kerry had lost these counties by double-digits , Obama was able to carve out small victories in a state he lost by a landslide . During the same election , Republicans held the open U.S. Senate seat vacated by Republican Chuck Hagel who retired . Former Republican Governor Mike Johanns easily defeated Democrat Scott Kleeb , a rancher , by 17.46 points . Johanns received 57.52% of the total vote while Kleeb took in 40.06% . At the state level , a candidate known to be a Republican picked up a seat in the nonpartisan and unicameral Nebraska Legislature in 2008. # Results # # Statewide # border= 1 cellpadding= 4 cellspacing= 0 style= margin : 1em 1em 1em 0 ; background : #f9f9f9 ; border : 1px #aaa solid ; border-collapse : collapse ; font-size : 95% ; ! colspan= 7 United States presidential election in Nebraska , 2008 ! colspan= 2 style= width : 15em Party ! style= width : 17em Candidate ! style= width : 17em Running mate ! style= width : 5em Votes ! style= width : 7em Percentage ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #FF3333 ; width : 3px ! style= background-color : #3333FF ; width : 3px ! style= background-color : #DDDDDD ; width : 3px ! style= background-color : #D2B48C ; width : 3px ! style= background-color : #999999 ; width : 3px ! style= background-color : #FFCC00 ; width : 3px ! style= background-color : #0BDA51 ; width : 3px # Congressional District # John McCain carried two of the states three congressional districts , while Barack Obama carried one congressional district held by a Republican . class=wikitable !

Their image is presented in a natural formation in the mountain of Skorve in the valley Kivledalen . To the legend is also a number of Norwegian folk tunes . # The legend # This known Norwegian legend tells of three maids , who played their clarions during mass . Their music was so beautiful that all the attendants were distracted , and went out to listen to them instead of the priest . This angered the priest , who cursed the girls and turned them to stone . They are still visible in the mountain . After some sources , this happened in late catholic times , and the priest involved was the last catholic parson in Seljord .

4 ' ' A Miser Brothers ' Christmas ' ' is a stop motion spin-off special based on some of the characters from the 1974 Rankin-Bass special ' ' The Year Without a Santa Claus ' ' . It is the final television special by Rankin-Bass . Distributed by Warner Bros. under their Warner Premiere label ( the rights holders of the post-1974 Rankin Bass library ) and Toronto-based Cuppa Coffee Studios , the one-hour special premiered on ABC Family on Saturday , December 13 , 2008 during the network 's annual The 25 Days of Christmas programming . Mickey Rooney and George S. Irving reprised their respective roles as Santa Claus and Heat Miser at ages 88 and 86 . Snow Miser , originally portrayed by Dick Shawn who died on April 17 , 1987 from a massive heart attack , was voiced by Juan Chioran , while Mrs. Claus , voiced by Shirley Booth in the original , was portrayed by Catherine Disher ( because Booth died in 1992 ) . The movie aimed to emulate the Rankin/Bass animation style . # Plot # Santa 's chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa decides to test the next day . Meanwhile , the feuding Miser Brothers attend their family reunion , where their brother , North Wind ( voiced by Brad Adamson ) , passively asks Mother Nature what might happen if Santa would be unable to complete his duties on Christmas . She responds that North Wind would take control instead . Self-absorbed and vain , North Wind becomes fixated with the idea of replacing Santa Claus as a way to achieve personal glory . Despite his dashing appearance and veneer of flattery and devotion toward his mother , North Wind is far more malevolent than either of his brothers . Beginning his machinations , North Wind sends two minions to sabotage the Super-Sleigh . The crippled sleigh causes Santa to injure his back after falling in the middle of a fight between the Miser Brothers as he unintentionally crosses into their domain .

This history would contradict ' ' The Year Without a Santa Claus ' ' , in which they identify each other as stepbrothers , as they appear this time to be fraternal twins . Upon learning the error of their ways , the two begin working together , and successfully get work back up to speed . However , North Wind hatches a plan to destroy their truce and get them fighting again , leaving Santa to deliver the toys and giving North Wind the chance to finish him off .

Meanwhile , North Wind attacks Santa 's sleigh in flight , whipping up a vortex to consume Santa but the Miser Brothers , with the aid of Tinsel and a team of young reindeer , save Santa in the nick of time . North Wind 's cover is blown and Mother Nature sentences him to household chores for the next several thousand years as punishment for his actions .

4 The Sutiya Kingdom was established by Birpal in 1187 in northeastern Assam , with the capital at Sadiya . The Sutiya are an indigenous ethnic group that spoke a Tibeto-Burman language , but now they speak Assamese language . According to tradition , Birpal at first became the chief of sixty families .

4 The YunnanBurma Railway ( alternatively : Burma-Yunnan Railway ) was a failed British project to connect far south-west China 's Yunnan province with the recently established rail network in British-ruled Burma . # History and Politics # The British project was working against the background of the successful French Yunnan-Vietnam Railway that had been established on the nearby Hanoi to Kunming route from 19041910 , some 30 years earlier . To secure the rights to construction , Britain referred to Article IV of the Anglo-French Siam Convention for ' mutual privileges ' . # Planning and surveying # Maria Bugrova 's article discusses the question of a railway to Yunnan from Burma . : ' ' In the 1880s , Great Britain drew special attention to the Upper Burma region and the roads to southwestern China . The former colonial officer of British Burma 's administration , A.R . Colquhoun , and an engineer of the Civil Works Department in India , H. Hallett , traveled in 1882 from Canton to Rangoon . A.R Colquhoun returned to England and sent his proposal to the Chamber of Commerce of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Rangoon and southwestern China through the Shan states . His proposal was approved by the Chamber . According to a preliminary calculation , the cost of work was about seven thousand pound sterling . One half of this amount had to be presented by the Chambers of Commerce , and another part had to be contributed by the Government . ' ' : ' ' By the end of 1884 , Hallett and Colquhoun received 3,500 pounds from the Chamber of Commerce for the investigation of building a railway . They found important information about climate , population and minerals . They drew special attention to liking . From their point of view , penetration of British goods into China depended on the amount of this tax . The difficulty of liking question substantially explained the British traders ' interest in building a railway . In case of this building it would be possible to avoid the payment of liking transferring goods to the interior of China . Colquhoun telegraphed daily to The Times about the expedition . ' ' There are references in the 1898 British ' ' Hansard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Little 's 1905 book ' ' The Far East ' ' mentioned the proposed route on page 124 : An article by Royal Arch Gunnison published in the ' ' San Francisco Chronicle ' ' on Thursday , November 27 , 1941 stated that American Engineers still expected 12 to 15 months to complete the railway and described a Dr. Victor Haas of the United States Public Health Service as in charge of sanitation and malaria prevention . Additional American personnel such as Paul Stevenson accepted commissions with the United States Public Health Service and were sent to assist with malaria control during the construction effort . # Abandonment # Unfortunately , it seems that construction of the line was abandoned due to Japanese advances , and was never resumed . Burma 's limited trading value to China and its internal political and military instability have probably been two major contributing factors . # Legacy # Today the Yunnan side of the line lies in ruin . Though signs here and there attest to its presence , there is little actual rail left , and the line has all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the most determined travellers . One such sign can be glimpsed opposite the ferry to Baodian , slightly south of Manwan in the far north-eastern section of Lincang prefecture .

4 ' ' Farmer v. Brennan ' ' , 511 U.S. 825 ( 1994 ) , was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that a prison official 's deliberate indifference to a substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate violates the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment . An amicus brief was submitted by Stop Prisoner Rape , which lauded the decision . # Case # Dee Farmer , a trans woman ( male-to-female transgender person ) , was incarcerated with the general male population after being transferred to the US Penitentiary Terre Haute , Indiana . She was repeatedly raped and beaten by the other inmates and acquired HIV as a result . Farmer claimed that the prison administration should have known that she was particularly vulnerable to sexual violence . The majority opinion of the Court agreed that it was the responsibility of prison officials to prevent prisoners from harming each other , to the point where prison officials who were deliberately indifferent were ruled liable under the Eighth Amendment . The court did not make prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... hold that a prison official may be held liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying humane conditions of confinement only if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it . # Justice Blackmun 's concurring opinion went further , saying that the government was responsible for the conditions inside even if no specific agent of the government had acted in a particularly culpable manner . # Where a legislature refuses to fund a prison adequately , the resulting barbaric conditions should not be immune from constitutional scrutiny simply because no prison official acted culpably . ... The responsibility for subminimal conditions in any prison inevitably is diffuse , and often borne at least in part , by the legislature . Yet , regardless of what state actor or institution caused the harm and with what intent , the experience of the inmate is the same . A punishment is simply no less cruel or unusual because its harm is unintended . In view of this obvious fact , there is no reason to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to prohibit cruel and unusual punishments only when they were inflicted intentionally . # The decision marked the first time the Supreme Court had directly addressed prisoner rape .

075514 ' ' Colossus and the Crab ' ' is a science fiction novel written in 1977 by the British author Dennis Feltham Jones . It is the third and final volume in The Colossus Trilogy and a sequel to Jones 's 1974 novel ' ' The Fall of Colossus ' ' . # Plot summary # The novel begins where its predecessor , ' ' The Fall of Colossus ' ' leaves off , with the supercomputer immobilized and the Martians arriving on Earth . They appear before Charles Forbin and his friend Edward Blake in the form of two black spheres , and quickly demonstrate vast intellect and powers of transformation and telepathy . After immobilizing Blake , they explain to Forbin their purpose in immobilizing Colossus their desire to take half of the Earth 's oxygen , a process that will kill nearly a quarter of the human population . In order to proceed with construction of the Collector designed to harvest the oxygen , the Martians reactivate the parts of Colossus necessary to manage human society . Though having no other option but to agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an alternative . He discovers in conversation with the Martians that their need for the oxygen is driven by the threat of radiation emanating from the Crab Nebula , which will kill the Martians without the protection of an oxygenated atmosphere . As construction of the Collector proceeds , a humbled Blake proposes to Forbin that the old Colossus the parent of the crippled system , be reactivated . With little other alternative , Forbin agrees . Construction equipment controlled by Colossus soon completes work on the Collector . An initial five-minute test of the device proves enormously destructive . With a second , final test imminent , Blake travels to Colorado with Angela , Forbin 's private secretary . Racing against time , Blake and a small team of workers succeeds in penetrating the mountain where the old Colossus is located and re-activating the computer , only to discover that , once imputed with the facts of the situation , Colossus argues that the collection program is in the best interests of humans ' long-term future and should move forward . Informed of the failure of their plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he embarks on a new plan . With his new secretary , a fervently devout woman named Joan , he flies to Portsmouth and takes command of the battleships stationed there for the Sea War Games . Yet doing so puts him out of contact with Blake and the old Colossus , who informs Blake that a solution might exist that is acceptable to both the Martians and humanity . Regaining control of the nuclear arsenal , Colossus contacts the Martians , who inform it of Forbin 's attempt to use the battleships to destroy the Collector . Though the Martians attempt to destroy the fleet using their device , they underestimate the power of the battleships ' guns , which succeed in destroying the Collector . Though the Martians are defeated Forbin dies in the process . He is buried by the reactivated Colossus , who reaches an agreement with the Martians . A smaller version of the Collector will extract the oxygen more gradually and sustainably ; in return , humanity , with the guidance of Colossus , will retreat to Mars once the Sun has become a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Professor Charles Forbin The Director of Staff for Colossus and his chief human representative . * Doctor Edward Blake The Director of Input for Colossus and a leader of the Fellowship . * Angela Forbin 's secretary , who harbors a secret love for her boss . * Joan Angela 's assistant , a member of the Sect , the organization that worships Colossus as God . * The Martians Two ancient beings of enormous intellect and power .

157514 Biodiversity banking , also known as biodiversity trading or conservation banking , is a process by which biodiversity loss can be reduced by creating a framework which allows biodiversity to be reliably measured , and market based solutions applied to improving biodiversity . Biodiversity banking provides a means to place a monetary value on ecosystem services . In the United States a mitigation banking process applies to impacts on wetlands . It requires that developers firstly avoid harm to wetlands , but if harm is considered unavoidable , then wetland habitat of similar function and values must be protected , enhanced or restored to compensate for those that will be damaged . The process comes under the US Clean Water Act 1972 the US Army Corps of Engineers regulations and the commitment to no net loss of wetlands habitat . Since about 2000 the term species banking , sometimes called conservation banking , has applied to impacts on species of special concern , typically those that are listed by state and federal agencies under the U.S. Endangered Species Act or its state-based equivalent . Similar to wetlands banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed species or their habitat , ensuring a similar no net loss policy for these biodiversity resources . Compensation for impacts to a stream riparian zone may also be required in relation to the linear distance of lost stream functions resulting from stream bank structures ( e.g. , concrete or rip rap ) , sedimentation , channelization , dredging or similar activities . Two biodiversity banking schemes operating in Australia are the New South Wales BioBanking scheme , which commenced in 2008 , and the Victorian Native Vegetation Management Framework scheme . Both schemes apply particularly to developers , where biodiversity values will be reduced through land clearing and building development . The framework requires developers to source biodiversity credits through a market mechanism to offset biodiversity loss . Listed species , critical habitat , wetlands and stream habitat are all components of biodiversity ecosystem services . Taken collectively , they may be referred to as biodiversity banks . # See also # *Biodiversity *Mitigation banking *Conservation in Australia *Environmental issues in Australia *Economics of biodiversity *Ecosystem services *Satoyama *Biodiversity offsetting # References # # Further reading # *

176514 Juan de Villagarca ( John de Villa Garcia , known as Joannes Fraterculus or Friar John ) ( died 1564 ) was a Spanish Dominican from Valladolid , known as the witness to one of the statements of confession and recantation by Thomas Cranmer. # Life # He was a pupil of Bartolom de Carranza , and came to England with Carranza , brought by Philip II of Spain . He was a Fellow and Praelector in Theology of Magdalen Hall , Oxford in 1555 . He was Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford in 1555 . He was the recipient of degrees of B.D. and D.D . at Oxford , in 1555 and 1558 respectively . He first met and discussed with Cranmer at Christ Church , Oxford , on 31 December 1555 . On January 1 , 1556 , in another discussion based on patristic texts , Cranmer was willing to sign the first of his statements , on papal supremacy , conditional on the history of the Council of Nicaea .

They met again at the Bocardo Prison adjacent to St Michael at the Northgate , when Villagarca and John Harpsfield interrogated Cranmer in the middle of February . On 26 February there was another statement , written in Latin and probably by Villagarca , that was signed by Cranmer and witnessed by Villagarca and Henry Syddall . This was the fifth statement written or signed by Cranmer ; he himself spoke of it as a return to the Catholic faith , and asked for sacramental absolution . On 20 March , the day of Cranmer 's execution , Villagarca accompanied him to the University Church of St Mary the Virgin , where Cranmer preached , and exchanged words in Latin with him afterwards . These are variously reported in ' ' Foxe 's Book of Martyrs ' ' and ' ' Cranmer 's Recantacyons ' ' , but concerned Cranmer 's denial of papal supremacy from the pulpit . On his return to Spain , Villagarca found that Carranza was in trouble with the Spanish Inquisition for alleged Lutheranism , and his name was linked to the charges . @ @ @

303514 ' ' Carex subnigricans ' ' is a species of sedge known by the common name nearlyblack sedge . # Distribution # This sedge is native to the western United States from California to Wyoming , where it grows in moist and dry mountain habitat above 2500 m in elevation in sub-alpine and alpine flora zones , such as in the High Sierra Nevada . # Description # ' ' Carex subnigricans ' ' produces stems no taller than about 20 centimeters from a network of thin rhizomes . The thin leaves are rolled tightly and resemble quills . The inflorescence is generally oval and pointed in shape and one or two centimeters long . 
308514 Wild silks have been known and used in many countries from early times , although the scale of production is far smaller than that from cultivated silkworms. # Background # Wild silk should not be confused with the very rare sea silk , which is produced from the fibres or byssus produced by the seashell ' ' Pinna nobilis ' ' and related species . Commercially reared silkworms of the species ' ' Bombyx mori ' ' ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) are normally killed before the pupae emerge , either by pricking them with a needle or dipping the cocoons into boiling water , thus allowing the whole cocoon to be unravelled as one continuous thread . This allows a much finer cloth to be woven from the silk . There are more than 500 species of wild silkworms in the world , although only a few are used to produce cloth . They usually produce a tougher and rougher silk than that from domesticated ' ' Bombyx mori ' ' silkworms . Wild silks are usually harvested after the moths have left the cocoons , cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one long thread , as with domesticated silkworms . Wild silks are more difficult to bleach and dye than silk from ' ' Bombyx mori ' ' , but most have naturally attractive colours , particularly the rich golden sheen of the silk produced by the muga silkworm from Assam . often known as Assam silk . The cocoon shells of wild silk moths are toughened or stabilized either by tanning ( cross-linking ) or by mineral reinforcements ( e.g. calcium oxalate ) . Recently , a new method has been developed , demineralizing , which can remove the mineral reinforcements present in wild silks and enables wet reeling like the commercial silkworm ' ' Bombyx mori ' ' . # Wild silk industry in India # Wild silks are often referred to in India as ' Vanya ' silks : # The term ' Vanya ' is of Sanskrit origin , meaning untamed , wild , or forest-based . Muga , Tasar , and Eri silkworms are not fully tamed and the world lovingly calls the silks they produce as ' wild silks ' . # # <p> India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muga and eri . The silkworm ' ' Bombyx mori ' ' is fed on mulberry leaves cultivated in plantations . Silkworms are also found wild on forest trees , e.g ' ' Antheraea paphia ' ' which produces the tasar silk ( Tussah ) . ' ' Antheraea paphia ' ' feeds on several trees such as ' ' Anogeissus latifolia ' ' , ' ' Terminalia tomentosa ' ' , ' ' T. arjuna ' ' ( ' ' Terminalia arjuna ' ' ) , ' ' Lagerstroemia parviflora ' ' and ' ' Madhuca indica ' ' . Wild silkworm ' ' Antheraea assamensis ' ' produces muga silk , and another wild silkworm ' ' Philosamia synthia ricini ' ' ( = ' ' Samia cynthia ' ' ) produces eri silk . The estimated annual production of tasar silk is 130 tonnes . Production of other types of silk exceeds 10 000 tonnes ( Gupta 1994 ) . </p> # The eri silk worm from India feeds on the leaves of the castor plant . It is the only completely domesticated silkworm other than ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but can not be easily reeled off the cocoon and is thus spun like cotton or wool . # Wild silk industry in China # Some of the best quality wild silk is produced by silkworms from Honan , which is the only type of wild silk that can be easily dyed . # History # Wild silk threads have been found and identified from two Indus River sites , Harappa and Chanhu-daro , dating to c. 2450-2000 BCE . This is roughly the same period as the earliest evidence of silk use in China , which is generally thought to have had the oldest silk industry in the world . The specimens of threads from Harappa appear on Scanning electron microscope analysis to be from two different species of silk moth , ' ' Antheraea mylitta ' ' and ' ' A. assamensis ' ' , while the silk from Chanhu-daro may be from a ' ' Philosamia ' ' species , ( Eri silk ) , and this silk appears to have been reeled . Wild silks were in use in China from early times . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire and apparently imported goods made from them by the time of the Later Han Dynasty in the 1st to 3rd centuries CE . There are significant indications in the literature that wild silks were in use in Persia and in Greece by the late 5th century BCE , apparently referred to as Amorgina or Amorgian garments in Greece . Pliny the Elder , in the 1st century CE , obviously had some knowledge of how wild silkworms ' cocoons were produced and utilised on the island of Kos for ' ' Coa vestis ' ' , even though his account included some fanciful ideas . # List of some wild silk moths and their silk # * ' ' Antheraea assamensis ' ' ( Helfer , 1837 ) . - From Assam .

396514 Phillip T. and Susan M. Ragon Institute is a medical institute to be created at the Massachusetts General Hospital by the funding from founder and CEO of InterSystems Phillip Ragon and his wife Susan Ragon to find vaccine for diseases of the immune system , particularly AIDS . The institute hopes to bring in scientists from Harvard University , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and the Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) , a level I trauma center which is the largest teaching hospital affiliated with the Harvard University Medical School . The Phillip T. and Susan M. Ragon Institute was officially established in February 2009 at MGH , MIT and Harvard with a dual mission : to contribute to the accelerated discovery of an HIV/AIDS vaccine and subsequently to establish itself as a world leader in the collaborative study of immunology . Founded with a commitment of $100 million from the Ragons , the institute is structured and positioned to significantly contribute to a global effort to successfully develop an HIV/AIDS vaccine through : * creating non-traditional partnerships among experts with different but complementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biologists , immunogeneticists , clinicians ) ; * providing a means for rapidly funding promising studies ( e.g. , elite controllers , innovative viral vectors ) and emerging concepts in the field ( e.g. , innate immune system memory ) ; * integrating key facets of current vaccine development efforts that have tended to follow separate tracks ( e.g. , seeking a combined antibody and T-cell solution ) ; * providing a substantial pool of accessible , flexible funding that will help lower the threshold for scientists to pursue risky , unconventional avenues of study that are unlikely to attract funding from traditional sources . Such funding will encourage innovation , compress the time it takes to conduct bench-to-bedside research and attract new minds to the field . The Ragon Institutes scientific leadership comprises a diverse group of world class immunologists , geneticists , infectious disease specialists and computational and systems biologists from the MGH , MIT , Harvard , the Broad Institute , Harvard-affiliated hospitals in Boston and from other leading institutions housing satellite collaborators around the country . The fusion of expertise represented in this partnership is unique in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to bring out the best in each institution 's and each investigators research . The Institute will be housed initially within the MGH . Once fully established , it is expected to occupy its own building and function as a catalyst for collaboration across these institutions .

The game was developed using Genesis3D , an open source game engine . # Plot # In the game , the protagonist ( the player can choose either a neo-Nazi or a Klansman ) runs through a ghetto killing African-Americans and Latinos , before descending into a subway system to kill Jews . Finally he reaches the Yiddish Control Center , where a fictionalized version of Ariel Sharon , then Prime Minister of Israel , is directing plans for world domination . The player must kill him to win the game . # Controversy # The Anti-Defamation League publicized the existence of the game and unsuccessfully lobbied the developers of Genesis3D to change their licensing conditions to prohibit the use of the engine to develop racist games . They have also lobbied the Interactive Digital Software Association to encourage their members to adopt such policies . Stuff Magazine named Ethnic Cleansing the 40th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 2010 , UGO ranked it as the #1 most racist video game in history . # Sequels and similar games # A sequel called ' ' White Law ' ' was released by the same developer in June 2003 with a similar premise , where the player assumes the role of a police officer going postal . It , however , attracted much less attention than ' ' Ethnic Cleansing ' ' . Both ' ' White Law ' ' and ' ' Ethnic Cleansing ' ' can only be ordered directly from Resistance Records .

545514 The Daughters of St. Mary ( Deir Banat Maryam ) is a Coptic community of nuns based in Beni Suef , Egypt . # History # Bishop Athanasius founded The Daughters of St. Mary during the feast of the Holy Cross ( March 19 , 1965 ) with the blessing of then Patriarch Kyrillos VI , and initiated their first women in 1970 . In 1974 , a new facility was built , creating outreach programs for the poor , the elderly , orphans , and mentally handicapped individuals . Since then , the community has expanded their operation to Cairo , Mukattam , and Turah . Bishop Athanasius oversaw the nuns until his death on 16 November 2000. # Social Works # The Daughters of St. Mary run several social projects as form of khedma , which in a Coptic context means service as an act for God . Their services include clinics and mobile clinics , nurseries , elementary schools , schools for vocational training , a crafts center , and projects for the mentally handicapped , for elderly people who are physically or mentally disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear their social servers toward the disadvantaged groups within Egyptian society .

Their community service allows the nuns to interact with the secular world , unlike other Coptic nuns , who spend most of their time cloistered in convents , praying for the world . Their dress is less constricting then other Coptic nuns , which allows them maneuverability to carry out their social projects . Their clothes are also gray rather than black , to symbolize their participation in the secular world .

551514 ' ' Poem of the Sufi Way ' ' , or ' ' Nazm al-suluk ' ' , is a poem by the Sufi mystic and scholar , Shayk Umar ibn al-Farid . An exact date of the poem 's writing is unknown as Umar ibn al-Farid ( 1181-1235ad ) is said to have written this text during the course of many years . Widely remarked as Umar ibn al-Farid 's most famous work , the poem itself is one of the longest pieces of Sufi literature to date , and is still held in high regard by modern Sufi practitioners . It is 760 verses long . It is often referred to as al-Ta'iyya al-kubra ( the Greater Poem Rhyming in T ) to differentiate it from a shorter ode that also rhymes in t . The title can also be translated to the Poem of Progress . # Origins # The origins of this work are shrouded in mythology . Most accounts of the poem 's construction derive from Shayk ibn al-Farid 's grandson , Ali sibt Ibn al-Farid in his biographical work ' ' Adorned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heralding his grandfather 's legacy and many of the stories surrounding it . According to Ali , Umar ibn al-Farid would fall into deathlike trances for days , then recover and spontaneously recite verses directly inspired by God ; these verses were then collected to form this long ode . In another story related by Ali , it is said that Umar received instruction from the prophet Muhammed himself , requesting that he title it as the Poem of the Sufi Way , instead of the original title intended by Umar ibn al-Farid , The Diaries of Hearts and the Gardens ' Sweet Scents . # Content # The poem itself is designed to demonstrate a pluralistic and mystical connection to God , or Allah . Initially , the poem likens the pursuit of God 's love to the pursuit of a female , written from the man 's perspective . The narrator becomes increasingly humbled throughout the poem , and , after much desperation and awe , the link to the narrator 's lover , or God , becomes obscured to the point of total cohesion . This felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristically Sufi , yet it is also an area of critique from Muslim orthodoxies who label such possibility of equality with God as heresy . # Translation # The translation of the poem is known for its difficulty . There are many puns based on variations of the three-consonant radical of most Arabic words , as was custom to the mannerist ( badi'a ) poetry of the time . # Thematic material # As expected from a poem of such length , the Poem of the Sufi Way covers many different themes and draws on many different backgrounds . As Michael Sells writes in the Preface to Umar Ibn al-Farid : Sufi Verse , Saintly Life : ' ' The poem of the Sufi Way is a microcosm of Islamic tradition at the time of Ibn al-Farid . A preliminary list of central themes of the poem would include the following : the famous lovers of classical Arabic poetry ; key themes and passages from the Qur'an and from the hadith , the stories of the Qur'anic prophets ; the stories of the four rightly guided Caliphs ; mystical interpretations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the pre-eternal covenant ; worlds of esoteric science ( alchemy , astrology , divination , numerology ) ; the psychology of Sufi states of altered consciousness ; the stations of Muhammad 's mi'raj , or the mystic in his or her journey to the divine beloved ; and interpretations of key mystical concepts such as fana ' --the passing-away of the human self in mystical union with the divine . ' ' # Commentaries # Its importance has merited many commentaries , including ones by including al-Farghn ( d. 1300 ) , al-Qshn ( d. 1334 ) , al-Qaysar ( d. 1350 ) , Jm ( d. 1492 ) , al-Brn ( d. 1615 ) , and al-Nbulus ( d. 1730 ) . Once an unknown religious scholar asked the Shaykh 's permission to write a commentary on the Poem of the Sufi Way . Ibn al-Farid asked how long the commentary would be . When the scholar replied that it would fill two volumes , Ibn al-Farid replied that he could compose a two-volume commentary on each verse . # Notes #

559514 The Thaumasia quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) Astrogeology Research Program . The Thaumasia quadrangle is also referred to as MC-25 ( Mars Chart-25 ) . The Thaumasia quadrangle covers the area from 60 to 120 west longitude and 30 to 65 south latitude on Mars . One of the first major networks of stream channels , called Warrego Valles , were discovered here by early orbiters . Another sign of water is the presence of gullies carved into steep slopes . # Martian Gullies # Gullies are common in some parts of Mars . Gullies occur on steep slopes , especially on the walls of craters . Martian gullies are believed to be relatively young because they have few , if any craters . Moreover , they lie on top of sand dunes which themselves are considered to be quite young . Usually , each gully has an alcove , channel , and apron . Some studies have found that gullies occur on slopes that face all directions , others have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poleward facing slopes , especially from 30-44 S. Although many ideas have been put forward to explain them , the most popular involve liquid water coming from an aquifer , from melting at the base of old glaciers , or from the melting of ice in the ground when the climate was warmer . Because of the good possibility that liquid water was involved with their formation and that they could be very young , scientists are excited . Maybe the gullies are where we should go to find life . There is evidence for all three theories . Most of the gully alcove heads occur at the same level , just as one would expect of an aquifer . Various measurements and calculations show that liquid water could exist in aquifers at the usual depths where gullies begin . One variation of this model is that rising hot magma could have melted ice in the ground and caused water to flow in aquifers . Aquifers are layer that allow water to flow . They may consist of porous sandstone . The aquifer layer would be perched on top of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms it would be called impermeable ) . Because water in an aquifer is prevented from going down , the only direction the trapped water can flow is horizontally . Eventually , water could flow out onto the surface when the aquifer reaches a breaklike a crater wall . The resulting flow of water could erode the wall to create gullies . Aquifers are quite common on Earth . A good example is Weeping Rock in Zion National Park Utah . As for the next theory , much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust . This ice-rich mantle , a few yards thick , smoothes the land , but in places it has a bumpy texture , resembling the surface of a basketball . The mantle may be like a glacier and under certain conditions the ice that is mixed in the mantle could melt and flow down the slopes and make gullies . Because there are few craters on this mantle , the mantle is relatively young . An excellent view of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crater Rim , as seen by HiRISE . The ice-rich mantle may be the result of climate changes . Changes in Mars 's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas . During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere . The water comes back to ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust . The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles . Water vapor will condense on the particles , then fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating . When Mars is at its greatest tilt or obliquity , up to 2 cm of ice could be removed from the summer ice cap and deposited at midlatitudes . This movement of water could last for several thousand years and create a snow layer of up to around 10 meters thick . When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere , it leaves behind dust , which insulating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the idea that snowpacks or glaciers are associated with gullies . Steeper slopes have more shade which would preserve snow . Higher elevations have far fewer gullies because ice would tend to sublimate more in the thin air of the higher altitude . Very few gullies are found in the Thaumasia region ; however , a few are present in the lower elevations like the one pictured below in Ross Crater . <gallery> Image:Context for Gullies in Ross crater.jpgCTX image of part of Ross Crater showing context for next image from HiRISE . Image:Gullies in Ross Crater.JPGGullies in Ross Crater , as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program . Because the gullies are on the narrow rim of a crater and they start at different heights , this example is not consistent with the model of gullies being caused by aquifers . **31;323;TOOLONG of gullies , as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program .

During a warmer climate , the first few meters of ground could thaw and produce a debris flow similar to those on the dry and cold Greenland east coast . Since the gullies occur on steep slopes only a small decrease of the shear strength of the soil particles is needed to begin the flow . Small amounts of liquid water from melted ground ice could be enough . Calculations show that a third of a mm of runoff can be produced each day for 50 days of each Martian year , even under current conditions . # Sand Dunes # Many places on Mars have sand dunes . Some craters in Thaumasia show dark blotches in them . High resolution photos show that the dark markings are dark sand dunes . Dark sand dunes probably contain the igneous rock basalt .

A study with the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter , Thermal Emission Imaging System ( THEMIS ) and the Mars Orbiter Camera ( MOC ) support the idea that Warrego Valles was formed from precitation . At first glance they resemble river valleys on our Earth . But sharper images from more advanced cameras reveal that the valleys are not continuous .

605514 Norton Juxta Twycross , usually known as simply Norton ' ' ( or Norton-Juxta ) ' ' , is a small village in Leicestershire , United Kingdom . The village is part of the parish of Appleby Magna , with the vicar based in Appleby . The village has traditionally , and historically , been known as Norton : deriving from the Anglo-Saxon , meaning North-Town ; with variable spellings including Northton and Nortone . The village , however , was also known for a brief period in the 17th century as Hoggs Norton . The village 's current name was acquired to differentiate the village from the several others in the county named Norton . Juxta is Latin for near , and Twycross is a small village approximately 2 miles southeast of Norton . # History # The village of Norton is thought to have been founded in the 8th or 9th century by the Anglo-Saxons . The Anglo-Saxon King thelred granted the village a charter in 951 , referring to it as Northton The village is listed in the Domesday Book as Norton , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1086 as Countess ' ' ( Lady ) ' ' Godiva , widow of Leofric , Earl of Mercia , famed ( legendarily ) for riding naked around the streets of Coventry . In both 1066 and 1086 the village is recorded as worth 0.3 . The village is listed as a very small settlement , with only four households , but has a quite large taxable value of 6 geld units . The Domesday Book records the village as home to 1 villager , 2 small holders and a priest , and is recorded as having land for 7 ploughs and 8 acres of meadow . In 1325 several people in Norton were arrested for the murder of Sir William de Monte Gomeri , which took place near to Merevale Abbey . Philippa , widow of the murdered Sir William , said that it was in the manor house at Norton , belonging to Walter de Monte Gomeri ( unclear how they are related ; may have been brother of deceased ) , that Robert de Gresley had sent his brother Peter to kill her husband . He was struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillipa 's arms . Philippa accused Joan , wife of Walter de Monte Gomeri of also being present at Norton Manor during that meeting , and of aiding , abetting and procuring the death of her husband . Robert and Joan appeared before the County Court and were transferred for trial at the Court of King 's Bench . Both stated they were not guilty but only Joan was given bail until the trial . The jury of their trial returned a not guilty verdict for the pair . Peter de Greseleye and another supposed accomplice William de Northfolk , both failed to appear before the County Court and were declared outlaws . Norton was previously an independent parish , however , by 1839 was recorded as a chapelry within the parish of Orton on the Hill . It is currently within the parish of Appleby Magna . # Holy Trinity Church # The Village 's parish church is dedicated to The Holy Trinity . The original church was built of wood in the 12th century , and the village acquiring its first rector in 1220 , whilst the church 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church seen today was built in the early 14th century , although it was heavily restored around 1841 . The tower formerly had a small spire , but this was dismantled in 1890 as it had become unsafe . The tower had also originally contained 3 bells : 1640 and the other two in 1663 . One , however , was recast in 1849 . The tower 's clock was made by Samuel Deacon 's company in Barton in the Beans . It was installed on 1 September 1840 , having cost 80 . The church vesty was built in 1850 and cost 100 to construct . The church is unusual in having two pulpits . The church 's Gothic style barrel organ was built in 1819 , in London , by James Butler : an apprentice of George England . It was installed within the church in 1840 and restored in 1980 , by John Burns of Nuneaton In 1829 , on the appointment of the Hon. Alfred Curzon as rector , the parish is revealed to have an annual income of 332 9s. 11d ; 200 of which came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rental of part of the parsonage house . # #Rectors# # Rectors of Holy Trinity Church , Norton : ' ' ( incomplete ) ' ' *Ralph de Querendon , - ' ' ( resigned 1329 ) ' ' *William de Lobenham , - ' ' ( 1329 - ) Subdean of Sarum ' ' *Robert Bytham , - ' ' ( resigned 1421 ) ' ' *Thomas Farmer , - ' ' ( c. 1564 ) ' ' *Thomas Royle , - ' ' ( died 1609 ) ' ' *Gabriel Rosse , - ' ' ( 1609 - 1658 ) ' ' *Josiah Whiston , - ' ' ( 1661 - 1685 ) ' ' *Theophilus Brookes , - ' ' ( died 1711 ) ' ' *Reubens Clarke , - ' ' ( 1711 - 1728 ) ' ' *Lancelot Jackson , - ' ' ( 1728 - 1745 ) ' ' *John Clayton , - ' ' ( 31 May 1745 - 1791 ) ' ' *William Carson , - ' ' ( 27 June 1796 - April 1811 ) ' ' *The Hon.

In 1725 Reverend Reuben Clark built a new rectory , but this had fallen into disrepair by 1797 . Reverend William Carsons ' ' ( tenure 1746-1811 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not completed . When The Hon. Alfred Curzon ( son of Nathaniel Curzon , 2nd Baron Scarsdale ) took over the position of rector in 1829 , the house was still unsuitable . Curzon ( who had gained his position through family connections to the local land owner , the Earl Howe ) chose to reside instead in a house near to his birthplace at Kedleston Hall , Derbyshire ( over 27 miles away ) : his duties as priest fulfilled by a curate from the neighboring parish of Appleby Magna . This lack of occupation is probably the cause of the rectory 's ongoing dilapidation , which was confirmed again in 1835 when the Rectory was described as being in a bad and dangerous state . In 1842 the then Rector , Andrew Bloxham , applied to receive Queen Anne 's Bounty in order to repair the rectory . Plans to rebuild were obviously abandoned when in 1850 reverend William Thomas Pearce Mead King constructed a new vicarage to the South-West of the village . The old rectory and outbuildings still remained until at least 1887 , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mead King 's new construction served as the village 's rectory until Norton joined Appleby Magna Parish , at which point it became a private residence , known as Norton Grange . In 1963 Norton Grange and its 12 acre gardens , were purchased for 12,000 by zoologist Molly Badham , who founded Twycross Zoo ( at first known as The East Midlands Zoological Society ) in the rectory 's gardens . Molly and the Zoo are famed for her work training Chimps , most notably for use in the PG Tips Tea Television advertisements which ran from the 1960s to the 1980s. # Population # The Hearth tax reveals there were 16 families living in the village in 1564 and a total of 40 inhabitants were charged the tax in 1664 . In 1829 the parish of Norton is revealed to have had a population of 301 ; with an additional 74 living in an exclave of the parish at Bilston . 
631514 A late protein is a viral protein that is formed after replication of the virus . One example is VP4 from simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) . In Human papillomavirus , two late proteins are involved in capsid formation : a major ( L1 ) and a minor ( L2 ) protein , in the approximate proportion 95:5% . L1 forms a pentameric assembly unit of the viral shell in a manner that closely resembles VP1 from polyomaviruses . Intermolecular disulphide bonding holds the L1 capsid proteins together . L1 capsid proteins can bind via its nuclear localisation signal ( NLS ) to karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) and inhibit the Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) nuclear import pathways during the productive phase of the viral life cycle . Surface loops on L1 pentamers contain sites of sequence variation between HPV types . L2 minor capsid proteins enter the nucleus twice during infection : in the initial phase after virion disassembly , and in the productive phase when it assembles into replicated virions along with L1 major capsid proteins . L2 proteins contain two nuclear localisation signals ( NLSs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other at the C-terminal ( cNLS ) . L2 uses its NLSs to interact with a network of karyopherins in order to enter the nucleus via several import pathways . L2 from HPV types 11 and 16 was shown to interact with karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) . L2 capsid proteins can also interact with viral dsDNA , facilitating its release from the endocytic compartment after viral uncoating.

899514 close = character = Shared-use busways with some city streets linenumber = 910 mapstate = expanded The Silver Line is a Metro Liner bus rapid transit line which runs west along a 26 mi route from the El Monte Station along the El Monte Busway to the Los Angeles Union Station and Downtown Los Angeles and then south along the Harbor Transitway to the Harbor Gateway Transit Center . It connects with the Metro Rail and Metrolink commuter rail systems . The line is operated by Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority . Since the line runs on streets in the Downtown Los Angeles area , the line is subject to detours . Usage has grown steadily since the service was introduced in December 13 , 2009 with weekday ridership reaching 13,765 in Oct 2012 . The El Monte Station was doubled in size between 2010 and 2012 to handle a total of 40,000 passengers a day and a joint fare program was introduced with the Silver Streak ( bus ) operated by Foothill Transit . The service runs every 48 minutes during the peak hour period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes on Saturdays and 30 minutes on Sundays/Holidays . Service during the night on Weekdays is every 3040 minutes . Service during the night on Saturdays , Sundays/Holidays is 60 minutes between 8:00 p.m. -9:00 p.m. , and then 40 minutes until the remainder of the night . The Silver Line 's route on the I-110 and I-10 freeways was converted to high occupancy toll ( HOT ) lanes with many other changes as part of the Metro ExpressLanes project which were complete by February 2013 . There are still a few transit improvements currently being worked on the Silver Line stations . # Description # The bus rapid transit line runs west from the El Monte Station in El Monte to Union Station using high-occupancy/toll lanes ( HOT lanes ) on the El Monte Busway . From there it heads south along surface streets through downtown Los Angeles , joins the Harbor Transitway using HOV lanes for the final section to the Harbor Gateway Transit Center in the district of Harbor Gateway near the city of Carson . It also serves California State University , Los Angeles , the County+USC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bus stops in the downtown area with connections to Metro Rail services and mainline rail services from Union Station . The line also serves stations in the communities of Exposition Park , South Los Angeles and Gardena . The Metro Silver Line serves a combination of stations and street stops . The Silver Line will have a new busway station near the Patsaouras Transit Plaza in June 2015 as part of the Metro ExpressLanes project . While none of the Silver Line stations are presently equipped with ticket vending machines , during a Metro Board of Directors meeting in January 2013 , the implementation of 5 ticket vending machines at the El Monte Station was approved . During August 2012 , Metro added a Metro pylon sign for the Silver Line at Harbor Gateway Transit Center , as part of the Metro ExpressLanes project . Metro has recently approved proposals to revitalize the Silver Line stations and improve wayfinding as well as adding art to their stations . Metro is expected to upgrade all of the Silver Line stations by December 2014. # Hours of operation # : Weekdays : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes off-peak , 30-40 minutes during late night : Saturdays : Every 20 minutes during the day , 60 minutes between 8:00p.m. -9:00p.m. , 40 minutes during late night : Sundays/Holidays : Every 20 minutes during the day , 60 minutes between 8:00p.m. -9:00p.m. , 40 minutes during late night First and last service to El Monte Station : ' ' Northbound to Downtown Los Angeles and Eastbound to El Monte Station ' ' : *First Bus to El Monte On Mondays-Fridays : 4:49 am : *First Bus to El Monte On Saturdays , Sundays/Holidays : 4:59 am : *Last Bus to El Monte On Mondays-Thursdays , Sundays/Holidays:12:56 am : *Last Bus to El Monte on Fridays &amp; Saturdays Nights : 2:00 am First and last service to Harbor Gateway Transit Center : ' ' Westbound to Downtown Los Angeles and Southbound to Harbor Gateway Transit Center ' ' : *First Bus to Harbor Gateway Transit Center on On Mondays-Fridays : 3:30 am : *First Bus to Harbor Gateway Transit Center on Weekends and Holidays : 4:58 am : *Last Bus to Harbor Gateway Transit Center On Mondays-Thursdays , Sundays/Holidays : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Fridays &amp; Saturdays Nights : 2:00 am # Fares # A flat premium fare of $2.45 or two fare zones is charged ( which is a different fare structure from other Metro routes ) . Metro Day Pass holders may use the service without paying any additional charges , which is a mitigation to passengers who now have to transfer to the Silver Line . Metro Silver Line riders can now use their Metro day pass , 7-day pass , or 30-day pass on the Silver Streak for a boarding between Downtown Los Angeles and El Monte Station . Likewise , Silver Streak riders can now use their Foothill 31-day passes on the Metro Silver Line between Downtown Los Angeles and El Monte Station . The program allows Metro Silver Line riders and Foothill Transit 's Silver Streak riders to ride the Silver Streak bus or the Metro Silver Line with either the Foothill Transit 31-Day Pass or the Metro 30-Day , 7-Day or Day Pass between the Silver 2 Silver bus corridor . The program only applies between Downtown Los Angeles and El Monte Station , although Foothill Transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metro Silver Line all the way from El Monte Station to Harbor Gateway Transit Center . Metro provides a subsidy to Foothill Transit to make up the 30-cent difference using funds from the Metro Express Lanes toll charge . The program will be reviewed in October 2013 and will be made permanent if it is deemed to be a success . The following table shows the Metro Silver Line fares as of July 25 , 2011 ( in US dollars ) . Since the Metro Silver Line runs almost entirely on the freeway , its fare is higher than the Metro Rail Lines , Metro **27;1860;TOOLONG Lines and Metro Orange Line . All payments are made on board the Metro Silver line bus . At the moment , there are no ticket vending machines for the Metro Silver Line , but Metro expects to begin installing them soon .

Fare Type ! Regular ! Senior <BR/> /Disabled <BR/> /Medicare # Ridership and reliability # Weekday ridership has risen from about 7,000 passengers when the service started in December 2009 to 7,741 in September 2010 ( partly due to passengers switched from the Foothill Transit Silver Streak ) , 10,414 and September 2011 and 13,765 by October 2012 . A ridership report of the line on May 2013 indicated average weekday ridership was roughly 12,799 , average Saturday boardings was 5,553 and average Sunday and holiday boardings was 3,708 . The on-time performance of the Metro Silver Line is currently around 77.8% . On time performance increased to 80% since the opening of the Metro Express Project is complete . With less cars on the hov lanes , the buses operate at faster speeds and less traffic on the lanes . # History # Opening of the route , originally scheduled for June 2009 , was delayed until December 2009 due to issues with funding and fare structure on other express lines using the transitways . Before the Metro Silver Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the El Monte Busway and the Harbor Transitway charged an express fare up to $3.95 ( included local portion of route plus freeway portion ) . If a passenger wanted to commute on both busways : El Monte Busway and the Harbor Transitway , the passenger would pay an express fare of $3.95 for each busway , totaling to $7.90 . The proposal base fare for the Metro Silver Line was $1.50 , as is available on the Metro Orange Line and Metro Blue Line . Objections were raised by Foothill Transit that the low fare would undermine their Silver Streak service which also runs on the El Monte Busway . A fare of $2.45 for the entire route , regardless of the length , was agreed upon . Ridership has grown steadily on the Harbor Transitway portion and many passengers have become accustomed to the fare structure . The Metro Silver Line was the only line in the Metro Rail/Liner system that did not have an opening ceremony with free rides offered to the public . This is one reason why the line is not well known by passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any reference to the Metro Silver Line . The line gets its color from the El Monte Busway route color . The Bronze Line name and color were also considered , but was removed from consideration for potential use with a future rail line . Metro Silver Line route connects all Metro Rail lines , including the Gold and Red/Purple Lines at Union Station , Red/Purple and Blue/Expo Lines at 7th/Metro and the Green Line at Harbor Freeway Station . The new line replaced Metro Express lines 444 , 446 , 447 , 484 , and 490 which previously ran on the Harbor Transitway and El Monte Busway . These lines were rerouted and re-numbered to provide connecting service to the Silver Line as follows : *Line 444 was replaced by 344 , which provided limited-stop service between the Harbor Gateway Transit Center ( formerly the Artesia Transit Center ) and Palos Verdes Peninsula . *Lines 446/447 were replaced by 246/247 which provided local service between the Harbor Gateway Transit Center and San Pedro ( Line 247 was later restructured as Lines 205 and 450 in June 2011 ) . *Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poly Pomona and El Monte Station via Valley Boulevard . *Line 490 became the 190 , providing local service between Cal Poly Pomona and El Monte Station via Ramona Boulevard . *Other routes on the transitways remained in operation . Service frequency on the Harbor Transitway section was increased to every 15 minutes during the midday period and every 40 minutes on Saturday in December 2011 . As part of the Metro ExpressLanes project a number of changes were made between 2010 October 2012 . Funding for increased service has come from federal funds and congestion pricing charges . *Additional weekday peak services were introduced in June 2012 and Sunday/holiday services were doubled to every 30 minutes . *In June 2012 Saturday service frequency was increased to 20 minutes and to 30 minutes on Sundays . *In August 2012 an additional evening service was added due to construction of the Metro Express Lanes project on the I-10 freeway . Service between the hours of 8:21 am 12:57 am now runs every 30 minutes . *The Harbor Gateway Transit Center ( formerly the Artesia Transit Center ) was provided with CCTV security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were provided with enhanced signage , lighting and security at Park &amp; Ride lots . *In August 2011 Eastbound local eastbound bus stops were created at the Slauson &amp; Manchester stations under the transitway ( prior to this passengers using the Metro Local Line 108 and Metro Limited Line 358 eastbound were required to walk one block to the stations ) . There is still no westbound stop . A new Silver 2 Silver fare structure was introduced in October 2012 . Prior to its introduction , the fare for the Silver Streak was $2.75 and $2.45 for the Metro Silver Line . As a result , many passengers opted to use the Metro Silver Line as opposed to the Silver Streak . Silver Line buses would often be at capacity during peak hours , even while running a 4-8 minute headway , with Silver Streak buses being under-utilized . Metro was initially looking at the possibility of adding additional service , but wanted to better use the El Monte Busway in conjunction with Foothill Transit . In addition , both services use the same fare pass , the TAP card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line as part of the June 23 , 2013 bus service changes . The first change was a new street stop was added for northbound buses at Figueroa Street/23rd Street to provide better connectivity to the 23rd Street Metro Expo Line Station . The street stop is also served by Metro Local line : 81 . The other minor change was a new southbound bus trip going from El Monte Station to Downtown Los Angeles and south to Harbor Gateway Transit Center in the early morning . The first trip departing El Monte Station to Downtown Los Angeles and then to Harbor Gateway Transit Center departs at 3:31 A.M. The new trip was added due to the demand for earlier morning service from El Monte Station to Downtown Los Angeles . On December 15 , 2013 Metro Silver Line 's southbound route became modified between Downtown Los Angeles and 23rd Street Metro Expo Line Station . The Silver Line now runs south on Flower St between 12th Street and 23rd Street . Northbound route and stops remain unchanged . Metro Silver Line stops at Figueroa/Pico , Figueroa/Washington and 23rd Street/Flower St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new stops are Flower/ Pico , Flower/Washington and Flower/23rd Street . The motive behind this change is due to the constant closure of Figueroa Street near the Convention Center and LA Live . Silver Line trips would often become delayed in this area due to congestive traffic . In addition , Metro Silver Line 's Sunday/Holiday service frequencies became enhanced to operate every 20 minutes on Sundays/Holidays . This matches the line 's Saturday service frequencies . Funding for more Silver Line service came from funds from the Metro Express Lanes . # Current developments # # Metro ExpressLanes project # The El Monte Busway and Freeway transitways are being converted to high occupancy toll ( HOT ) lanes as part of the Metro ExpressLanes project . The Harbor Freeway sectionbegan operation as a HOT lane on November 14 , 2012 and the El Monte busway portion began February 23 , 2013 . It will be retained if it proves to be successful in improving traffic speeds on the transitways . Work to create the high occupancy toll lanes on the Harbor Transitway took place between August 2011 and September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted Bus priority to traffic lights in Downtown Los Angeles as part of the Metro ExpressLanes project which was expected to improve service performance in Downtown Los Angeles . This work was completed by October 31 , 2012 . CCTV cameras were installed at the Harbor Transitway Stations . They were installed at the parking lots during the month of September 2012 . Digital message signs are currently being tested for operation . The digital message signs would tell passengers at what time will the Silver Line bus pass and also Metro Express Lines . The CCTVs and the digital message signs were placed into service on October 31 , 2012 . Installation of bike lockers were installed at Harbor Gateway Transit Center during July 2010 . The new El Monte Station opened to the public on October 14 , 2012. # New transitway station at Patsaouras Transit Plaza # A new transitway station for the Metro Silver Line will be located at Patsaouras Transit Plaza at Union Station to provide better access to bus , MetroRail , Metrolink and Amtrak services which is expected to be complete by July 2015. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 , adjacent to the El Monte Station terminus . When the Metro Silver Line began operation on December 13 , 2009 , the line was also operated by Division 18 . In June 2010 , operation of the line was turned over completely to Division 9. # Incidents # Vehicle strike at the Harbor Freeway Station On February 22 , 2012 seven passengers waiting on the northbound platform of the Harbor Freeway Station received critical and serious injuries when a private vehicle entered the station and struck the platform . Metro 's safety committee reviewed station safety at the request of Metro 's CEO , Art Leahy and published their report in April 2012 . Bollards were added at the platform edge of a number of stations during August 2012. # Stations &amp; Street Stops # One different feature between the Metro Orange Line and the Metro Silver Line is the station features . While the Metro Orange Line operates on a dedicated busway with only busway stations and no street stops , the Metro Silver Line operates a combination of street stops and busway stations . The Downtown Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detours which means the street stops may or may not be served by the Metro Silver Line during detour times . # Fleet # Metro Silver Line received 27 CNG ( Compressed Natural Gas ) powered 45ft m buses which were built by North American Bus Industries at the companys facility in Anniston , Alabama . The buses were received to Metro in May 2009 . These buses were painted in a silver paint . Nearly all of the buses were first used for the Metro Local Line : 902 , which was supposed to relive ridership of the Metro Orange Line . Metro Local Line 902 was canceled in late 2011 due to its poor ridership and excessive duplication with the Metro Orange Line . These buses were provided when Line 902 in the San Fernando Valley was cancelled . When Metro Local Line 902 was canceled , all 27 NABI buses were moved to Metro 's San Gabriel Valley bus division 9 in El Monte . In June 2011 , most of the buses were wrapped to brand the Metro Silver Line . Though the Silver Line is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have the Metro Liner name and dark gray livery . As of December 2011 , all 27 45 feet Compost NABI buses are painted in Metro Silver scheme . The buses say A faster way to Downtown : Metro Silver Line . The service is operated with 45ft m buses in a silver scheme branding the Metro Silver Line . The line is internally known as Line 910 or Dual Hub BRT . Currently . there are 35 buses painted in the Metro Silver Line fleet . They include buses #83608391 , 8405 and 85128514 . Originally the Metro Silver Line began service with 27 buses painted the metro local scheme . In December 2011 , all 27 buses were painted in a silver sleek color branding the Silver Line . In mid-2012 , Metro Silver Line received #83888391 and #8405 in the metro local scheme . Bus #8405 was originally in the West Valley division , but it was then transferred to division 9 for the Silver Line . In September 2012 , all 5 of these buses were painted in the Silver Line livery . With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , 3 additional buses ( #85128514 ) , painted in the metro local livery were transferred to division 9 .

4 Imperial Medicals Rugby Club ( Imperial Medics ) is the name given to the rugby union team of Imperial College School of Medicine Students ' Union , a modern amalgam of three formerly distinct hospital rugby clubs each with a long history , having all been founded in the nineteenth century . The teams from Charing Cross Hospital and Westminster Hospital were the first to merge in 1984 following the union of their respective Medical Departments . When St Mary 's Hospital , London also merged in 1997 the team was strengthened by one of the two most successful hospital sides in London . Imperial Medics is notable for its recent dominance of the oldest competition in rugby , the United Hospitals Cup , as well as its history and the joint history of its constituent elements which have produced a large number of international players . # History # The history of Imperial Medicals Rugby Club is the combined history of three older sides , and their joint history from the point of merger : *St Mary 's Hospital Medical School - October 1865 *Charing Cross Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School - 1981 *Imperial College School of Medicine - 1997 # Competitions # Since Inauguration in 1997 IMRFC have enjoyed the following successes : * United Hospitals Cup Winners - 98 , 99 , 00 , 02 , 03 , 04 , 05 , 06 , 07 , 08 , 10 , 11 , 14 * United Hospital Cup Sevens Winners - 00 , 04 , 05 , 06 , 08 , 12 , 13 * JPR Williams Cup Winners ( IMRFC v Imperial College ) - 03 , 04 , 05 , 06 , 07 , 08 , 09 , 10 , 11 , 14 * Winners of Herts , Middlesex 1 Courage League and Promotion to London North West 3 - 1999 * Promotion to BUSA Premiership South in 1999 , 2003 , 2006 , 2010 * 2nd XV United Hospitals Cup Winners - 01 , 03 , 06 , 07 , 08 , 10 , 11 * 2nd XV Varsity Match Winners - 05 , 06 , 07 , 08 , 09 , 10 , 11 * 2nd XV Middlesex Merit League Division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winners - 01 , 02 , 03 , 06 , 07 , 08 , 09 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 * 3rd XV Varsity Match Winners - 05 , 06 , 07 , 08 , 09 , 10 , 11 , 14 class= sortable wikitable border= 1 cellpadding= 5 cellspacing= 0 align= center ! style= background : #ffdead ; Hospital Team ! style= background : #ffdead ; First Competed ! style= background : #ffdead ; Last Competed ! style= background : #ffdead ; Current Status ! style= background : #ffdead ; Wins ! style= background : #ffdead ; Total Wins including constituent elements # Notable former players # # Internationals # # #St Mary's# # Source : * - : D J Cussen ' ' ( 1921-27 ) ' ' * - Tuppy Owen-Smith ' ' ( 1934-37 ) ' ' - captain , also 5 caps for the South Africa cricket team * - Tommy Kemp ' ' ( 1937-48 ) ' ' - captain * - Edward Scott ' ' ( 1947-48 ) ' ' - captain * - Nim Hall ' ' ( 1947-55 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1947-48 ) ' ' * - Lewis Cannell ' ' ( 1948-57 ) ' ' * - : James Murphy O'Connor ' ' ( 1954 ) ' ' - possibly the first player to use the round-the-corner style of goal-kicking at international level and the brother of Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor * - N M Campbell ' ' ( 1956 ) ' ' * - Trevor Wintle ' ' ( 1966-69 ) ' ' * - JPR Williams ' ' ( 1969-81 ) ' ' * - Kevin Simms ' ' ( 1985-88 ) ' ' * - Richard Wintle ' ' ( 1988 ) ' ' # #Westminster# # * Sidney Nelson Crowther ' ' ( 1903 ) ' ' # #Imperial Medicals# # * - Nnamdi Obi - England Sevens , England Students * - Ewan Wilson - West Indies Sevens , West Indies Rugby League , English Universities * - James Logan - England Students * - Dimitri Amiras - Greece # Notable non-internationals # *David Rocyn-Jones , a former president of the Welsh Rugby Union

7514 Johannes Erasmus Iversen ( 17131755 ) was a Danish Baroque composer . He also worked as a teacher , musician , conductor and a concert organizer . # Life # Originally a student at the University of Copenhagen , Iversen chose to make his living as a musician . From 1740 , he regularly arranged public concerts together with other performers . This led to the creation of the Musical Society in 1744 , which Iversen soon came to lead . The organization was both a musical society and an academy of music . The Society was closed down in 1749 , but soon after Iversen created a new ' ' Collegium Musicum ' ' . This new society consisted in part of musicians educated by Iversen . When Iversen was appointed precentor in Vor Frue Kirke , the cathedral of Copenhagen , the concerts by the new society diminished . Iversen himself apparently rarely gave concerts in public after that . # Work # Iversens compositions have apparently been lost , but it is known that he composed several cantatas . The titles of these have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English : ' ' Temple of Providence ' ' ) from 1747 . As cantor at the University , he also composed several works for various festivities at the university . Among these were a cantata from 1752 in memory of Queen Louise , who was married to King Frederick V and died in 1751 . Another cantata was composed in honor of the new queen Juliana Maria , who married Frederick V in 1752 . One of his last works was the mourning music over his friend Ludvig Holberg , a famous Danish playwright .

4 Cyclic succession is a pattern of vegetation change in which in a small number of species tend to replace each other over time in the absence of large-scale disturbance . Observations of cyclic replacement have provided evidence against traditional Clementsian views of an end-state climax community with stable species compositions . Cyclic succession is one of several kinds of ecological succession , a concept in community ecology . When used narrowly , cyclic succession refers to processes not initiated by wholesale exogenous disturbances or long-term physical changes in the environment . However , broader cyclic processes can also be observed in cases of secondary succession in which regular disturbances such as insect outbreaks can reset an entire community to a previous stage . These examples differ from the classic cases of cyclic succession discussed below in that entire species groups are exchanged , as opposed to one species for another . On geologic time scales , climate cycles can result in cyclic vegetation changes by directly altering the physical environment . # History # The cyclic model of succession was proposed in 1947 by British ecologist Alexander Watt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heath , and bog communities , Watt describes the plant community is a regenerating entity consisting of a space-time mosaic of species , whose cyclic behavior can be characterized by patch dynamics . Based on the current composition and its corresponding stage of succession , he explains , a community can either be in an upgrade phase toward late-successional shrubs or downgrade degenerate phase toward grasses . These phases would occur in a predictable cycle . Watts study has since become a classic example frequently cited in scientific ecology . # Modeling cyclic succession # The cyclic model of succession can be displayed in terms of a transition matrix . Based on the Markov chain , the matrix describes the likelihood of future states based on the milieu of present states . The three states in the simplest cyclic model are open substrate ( usually a bare patch of land ) , Species A dominance , and Species B dominance . With respect to facilitation , inhibition , and tolerance models of succession , the key feature of the cyclic model is that A and B are not autosuccessional that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rather , A will either facilitate the succession of B or be eliminated ( through mortality ) such that the patch occupied becomes open substrate . Likewise , B will either facilitate the succession of A or be eliminated . Open substrate can remain open or become occupied by either A or B. This configuration results in a cyclic scheme of species dominance . # Mechanisms # Cyclic succession is a descriptive phenomenon that can be accounted for in several ways . In Watts bog system , he suggested that factors endogenous to the plant species were at play . He writes , Each patch in this space-time mosaic is dependent on its neighbours and develops under conditions partly imposed by them . In other words , species life history characteristics fluctuate cyclically under the influence of surrounding species . These periodic shifts in life history properties produce observable changes in community composition . In the system Watt observed , phasic development was specifically responsible for changes in growth and mortality rate . As a result of changes in survival and growth ability , the balance of species dominance shifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships satisfies the conditions described in the model above , a cyclic pattern of succession is observed . Exogenous factors , such as depredation by herbivores , can also be indirect drivers for cyclic succession if they differentially modulate plant life history properties over time . Density-dependent root gnawing by rodents is proposed as one such mechanism in the Larrea-Opuntia system . Watt noted that cyclic fluctuations in mortality rate could also be produced through differential response to seasonal conditions like frost . It is important to note that patterns cyclic succession can not be readily linked to any single species , as Watts ' ' Calluna ' ' bushes have been observed in non-cyclic systems . Rather , it is the aggregate composition of species that gives rise to the cyclic process . # Additional empirical evidence # Strong empirical evidence for cyclic succession can be found in Watts follow-up publication on the bracken system in the Journal of Ecology . ' ' Calluna vulgaris ' ' and ' ' Pteridium aquilinum ' ' were found to replace each other . Another salient example of cyclic replacement occurs in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water availability is limiting such that only one species would be predicted to survive , ' ' Larrea tridentata ' ' and ' ' Opuntia leptocaulis ' ' are observed to replace each other in the absence of environmental disturbance . # Notes # # Further References # *Van der Maarel , Eddy ( 2005 ) .

The trilogy consists of ' ' Shaun of the Dead ' ' ( 2004 ) , ' ' Hot Fuzz ' ' ( 2007 ) , and ' ' The World 's End ' ' ( 2013 ) .

The name originates from a silly joke during the promotion of ' ' Hot Fuzz ' ' , when somebody pointed the Cornetto connection out to Wright . While the three movies are not a true trilogy , they do portray a related item in each and he suggested that the three flavours of Cornetto was a reference to Krzysztof Kielowski 's ' ' Three Colours ' ' film trilogy . According to Wright , Wall 's , manufacturer of the Cornetto , were very pleased with the namecheck .

Martin Freeman , Bill Nighy , Rafe Spall , Julia Deakin , Patricia Franklin and Garth Jennings are the only actors , apart from Pegg and Frost , to appear in every film of the trilogy , and of those only Deakin also appeared with Frost and Pegg in ' ' Spaced ' ' .

It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2005 jamboree . Tickets were distributed to the troops , with an average of 18 tickets for each one , enough for half of the Scouts to attend . The tickets instructed the Scouts to attend in patrols of 9 , and each were good for one showing . The show was presented every 20 minutes but lasted over an hour . Each presentation of the program had three groups of four patrols of 9 Scouts each , that is , 108 people . No-shows were filled in with Scouts from a standby line . After doubling the amount of money spent on the jamboree , The Mysterium Compass cost over $1,000,000 to produce and had a staff of just above 300 . It was closed to anyone over 18 . Participants who completed the show were given a medallion for their jamboree emblem patches . # Arena shows # The 2010 National Scout Jamboree featured two arena shows : one on July 28 , and another one was held on July 31 . Both arena shows featured Chief Scout Executive Bob Mazzuca . The first arena show featured several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates . The main arena show featured Mike Rowe , host of Discovery Channel 's ' ' Dirty Jobs ' ' , and musical performances by Alex Boy , Honor Society and Switchfoot . The show ended with the largest fireworks display ever performed on a military base or at a national Scout jamboree . There was some controversy over President Obama not appearing , as he had chosen to pre-record his appearance on The View that day - instead leaving a video message congratulating the Boy Scouts of America on their centennial . At the 2005 jamboree , there were problems with a water shortage during the first arena show . This was not repeated in the second show or in those at the 2010 jamboree . Cases of water bottles were distributed everywhere on the arena seating area , with large stacks at the sides , back , and along the roads to the arena . In total , approximate three-quarters of a million bottles of water were placed in the arena during the 2010 National Scout Jamboree - in order to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to their camps from the second arena show after dark , some participants without flashlights had trouble avoiding running into extra cases of water bottles as they lay on the ground and the roads . A few others carried cases back to their camps because the water in the bottles tasted better than that distributed in the water system . # Social networking # There was a focus on social networking at this jamboree which was entirely new . Generally , Scouts are instructed to leave their electronics at home when on camping trips , but this event was an exception . AT&amp;T , one of the corporate sponsors , provided excellent cell phone coverage and a Wi-Fi network which spanned the entire site . This effected a better signal in the jamboree site than in most residential areas . AT&amp;T also provided netbooks and cell phones for use by the Scouts in their Connection Centers , located throughout the site . There were also secure device charging lockers next to each connection center where phones or other devices could be recharged , although this set-up became controversial after scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a personal charging station . The jamboree trading posts sponsored competitions for videos and pictures submitted by participants . Staff members and signs placed around the site encouraged Scouts to tell about their experiences on various social websites . This allowed parents , siblings , and friends at home to get in on the action and see what was happening . Overall , the event was covered extensively on the internet as well as in local and national news . # Deaths # A staff member was found dead in his bed on August 3 , 2010 ; the cause of the death was cardiac dysrhythmia 
7514 occupation = Actor rr = Gim Gang-u Kim Kang-woo ( born July 11 , 1978 ) is a South Korean actor . # Career # Kim Kang-woo majored in film production at Chung-Ang University , and made his acting debut in Kim Ki-duk 's 2002 film ' ' The Coast Guard ' ' while still a senior , later commenting that the role of a soldier was the only one he could get without any prior experience . Subsequent roles in the drama series ' ' Breathless ' ' and ' ' Three Leafed Clover ' ' earned Kim the nickname Mr. Right as he became known for his portrayal of honest and diligent characters . His first leading film role was in Jeong Jae-eun 's 2005 sophomore feature ' ' The Aggressives ' ' , for which he and co-star Chun Jung-myung were the co-recipients of the Best New Actor award at the 6th Pusan Film Critics Awards .

In spite of its poor box office performance , ' ' The Railroad ' ' found favour with critics , and Kim won the Best Actor award at the 25th Torino Film Festival . Although happy to win the award , Kim found it more gratifying to observe Italian audiences responding to the film in the same way as Korean audiences , recognizing the power of film to transcend national borders . He also admitted to being anxious because of the increased expectations people would have over his future performances . Based on a popular manhwa , the film focused on the conflict between two rival chefs , played by Kim and Im Won-hee .

4 The Scott Trial is a British motorcycle trials competition dating from 1914 run over an off-road course of approximately 70 miles . One of the most challenging trials events in the UK , its appeal is to clubman riders as well as international professional riders . The Scott raises money for the Scott charities , a range of local non-profit making organisations . # History # The Scott Trial began in 1914 when Alfred Angas Scott , inventor and founder of the Scott Motorcycle Company challenged the workers at his factory to ride from the factory in Shipley through the Yorkshire Dales to Burnsall , a riverside village near Grassington . Of the 14 starters only 9 finished . The event was reintroduced after the First World War in 1919 and although Alfred Scott died in 1923 the event continued to be run by the Scott workers until 1926 . The Bradford and District Motor Club then took over the management of the event and moved the start and finish to Blubberhouses , a small village in the borough of Harrogate in North Yorkshire . In 1938 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to allow motorcycle trials on their property , so the trial was moved again to Swainby , on the north western corner of the North York Moors National Park in Cleveland and control was taken over by the Middlesbrough and Stockton Motor Clubs . # Swaledale # In 1950 the Auto-Cycle Union , the governing body of motorcycle sport in Great Britain , divided the area into the North Eastern Centre and the Yorkshire Centre and the Scott Trial was moved to Swaledale , one of the northernmost dales in the Yorkshire Dales National Park , where it has remained to this day . The Darlington and District Motor Club took over the organisation until 1990 , when the Richmond Motor Club took over . # The 1962 Scott Trial # In his career of over 1000 wins trials champion Sammy Miller considers the 1962 Scott Trial as the greatest ever . A week of rain meant the course was muddy and dangerous . Conditions were so bad that only 40 finished from a field of 185 that started , with Miller 's Ariel 500cc a clear winner . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Present day # The current Scott Trial continues to be a time and observation event run over an off road course of 84 miles , divided into 76 sections . Riders lose marks for putting a foot down or footing in the observed sections and for finishing behind the fastest rider . Over the years a huge range of special awards and memorial trophies have become associated with the Scott Trial , including ' best performing Yorkshireman ' and ' oldest official finisher ' . As in 1962 the weather can be as harsh as the course . In 1998 only 27 of the 147 entries completed the course . On this occasion Graham Jarvis won for the third time with the fastest time of 5 hours 50 minutes . In 2008 rain reduced the finishers to 60 out of 200 with Jarvis winning for the 8th time . In 2009 Graham Jarvis won again despite being 28 minutes slower than the previous years runner-up James Dabill .

514 Ethel ( d ) reda Malte ( sometimes referred to as Audrey ; ) was an English courtier of the Tudor period who was reputed to be an illegitimate daughter of King Henry VIII . She was the wife of poet and writer John Harington prior to Isabella Markham . Contemporary reports claim she was fathered by Henry VIII . Almost nothing is known about her mother , a woman identified as Joan Dingley , alias Dobson ; under the circumstances , Joan would have been a member of the lesser nobility , not well-connected at court . One theory is she was a laundress Though he never openly acknowledged Etheldreda , Henry VIII did give his tailor , John Malte , land and properties when Malte recognized her as his illegitimate daughter . When he died in 1547 , her putative father ( Malte ) left her money in his will , and in 1548 the reasonably well-endowed heiress became the first wife of John Harington , an eligible court official who served Lord High Admiral Thomas Seymour ( evidently her previous engagement to an illegitimate grandson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to the marriage properties previously owned by Shaftesbury Abbey . Sometime in 1550 , she had a daughter : Hester ( or Esther ) Harington . On 18 March 1554 , Etheldreda Malte was among the six ladies who accompanied the future queen Elizabeth to the Tower of London where her rumoured half-sister was imprisoned under suspicion of causing rebellion . Etheldreda was present at the coronation of Elizabeth I on 15 January 1559 and she died that same month . Her husband remarried within two months of her death . She may have died at St Catherine 's Court , her residence near Bath , and perhaps lies buried in the church next door ; but this is conjectural , as the church records for the period have been lost . # Fictional portrayals # Audrey is the protagonist of ' ' Royal Inheritance ' ' , a historical novel by Kate Emerson . # Notes # 
4 Yitzhak Yosef ( ) , born January 16 , 1952 , is the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel , also known as the Rishon LeZion , the rosh yeshiva of Yeshivat Hazon Ovadia , and the author of a popular set of books on Jewish law called Yalkut Yosef . Rabbi Yosef is the son of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef , former Chief Rabbi of Israel , and bases his rulings on Jewish law on his father 's methods of ruling . His books are considered foundational among large sectors of Sephardic Jews in Israel and the world . For these books , he has won the Rabbi Toledano Prize from the Tel Aviv Religious Council , as well as the Rav Kook Prize . # Biography # Yosef was born in 1952 , the sixth son of Shas ' spiritual leader , and former Israeli Chief Rabbi , Ovadia Yosef , .

In 1971 , when he was 18 and studying at Yeshivat HaNegev , he collected halakhic rulings from the five volumes of ' ' Yavia Omer ' ' , the book of his father 's responsa , that had been published by then , and published them in the book Yalkut Yosef . The book was published with his father 's support and supervision . It is often considered one of his father 's books because it is a summary of his father 's rulings , since he went over it section by section and added his comments . In 1973 , with his father 's election as Chief Rabbi of Israel , together they established the Kollel Hazon Ovadia . In 1980 , he was ordained as a rabbi and judge , along with the rest of the first class of the graduates , by the chief rabbis of Israel and by chief rabbi of Jerusalem Shalom Messas .

As part of his responsibilities , he gave lectures and classes in the secular public schools and strengthened religious education there . In 1992 he expanded Hazon Ovadia to a yeshiva for boys high school age and older . This was necessary because of unrest among the Sephardi Haredi community stemming from disagreements with the Ashkenazi Litvak yeshivot . On July 24 , 2013 , Rabbi Yosef was elected to serve as Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel and Rishon Lezion , a position he will hold for the next decade . The inauguration took place on 14 August 2013 at the official residence of the President of Israel .

It is situated on the B5299 road about four miles ( 6 km ) south-south-west of Carlisle city centre , and approximately five miles ( 8 km ) from Junction 42 of the M6 motorway . The village has a population of around 2500 , and serves as a key service centre for a much wider rural area . At the centre is The Square , which is , in fact , not square . It is dominated by St Michael 's and All Angels Church . Most of the shops are located in and around The Square . To the northwest of the centre of the village is the Barras Lane business estate which is home to numerous businesses . The village is on the River Caldew and is served by the Dalston railway station on the Cumbrian Coast Line .

4 James Thompson Marshall ( d. 1931 ) was a British railway and mechanical engineer known for inventing the ' Marshall valve gear ' for steam locomotive use . James Marshall began his engineering career at the Leeds-based Steam Plough Company , and later moved to the city 's Boyne Engine Works . # Marshall valve gear # J. T. Marshall invented and patented several different valve gears but these should not be confused with the Marshall valve gear patented by Marshall , Sons &amp; Co. in 1879 . At least one of J. T. Marshall 's valve gears was a rotary type and the only known application was to the Austrian BB Class 114 locomotive . The better-known J. T. Marshall gear was a modified Walschaerts valve gear which was first applied to a Great Northern Railway mineral locomotive , no. 743 , in 1901 and received a glowing report . Next , it was tried on GNR Class C2 No. 1520 in March 1903 . There was no external change visible on the locomotive as a result of this modification . When the valve gear was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of which gave lap and lead movement by swinging the link backwards and forwards on its suspension bracket . The other eccentric was set at 90 degrees to the crank and rocked the link by means of a bell crank on the hanging link pin . The position of the radius rod die pin in the link determined the direction of movement and the cutoff . Showing little advantage over the normal Stephenson link valve gear , it was removed from the C2 ' Atlantic ' in April 1907 to ease maintenance . A modified version of the gear ( for outside drive ) was tried on SECR N class no. 1850 in 1933-4 but , again , it was not a great success . # Patents # * 14242/1894 Improvements in steam engine valves and gear for working them , with Reginald Wigram .

4 Balgownie Rangers Football Club is an association football club based in Balgownie , New South Wales . They play in the Illawarra District League . Founded in 1883 , Balgownie is believed to be the oldest running association football club in Australia . # History # Balgownie Rangers is the oldest running registered association football club in Australia being formed in 1883 . The club was formed in 1883 where it played against other social clubs and also between Balgownie teams . In 1890 , Balgownie Rangers was officially registered to play in the newly formed N.S.W. Football Association . Balgownie was the 5th club to form in Australia , Granville , Arcadians , Kings College and one other club formed a few years before 1883 . Since then all of these clubs have folded , Granville being the last to fold in the early 1980s , making Balgownie Rangers the oldest registered running football club in Australia . The club is full of tradition and has produced many famous football players over the years . Some include James Judy Masters ( who is listed in the Football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Frank Smith in the early 1900s , George Barlow in the 1950s and more recently Matt Horsley who went on to captain the Wollongong Wolves , win 4 National Soccer League titles and also represent Australia .

4 The Mahal , are sometime pronounced Mandal , are a Jat gotra , now found mainly in Punjab , although few are still found in Jarauda in Muzaffarnagar District of Uttar Pradesh . They are one of the larger Muley Jat clans . # History and origin # The Mahal or Maahal are a tribe that originally came from Samana and settled in Karnal , in what is now Haryana . It acquired the name Mahal from an ancestor who was found newly born by his dead mother 's side . In the local dialect of Hindi and Urdu ( Haryanwi ) , marhi is a tomb or shrine . During the reign of the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam , a member of the tribe converted to Islam . In return , he was a granted an estate in Muzaffarnagar , Charthawal and Saron . In 1806 , after providing assistance to the British in the Anglo-Maratha wars , the family was granted a Jagir ( estate ) in Karnal . According to other traditions , they are descended from Yazdgerd III , the last Sassanian ruler of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prithvi Raj Chauhan , under a Malik Salahauddin . On the recommendation of the nawab of Samana , the Malik received a grant of a 100 villages ( referred to as mandal in the Hindi language ) , from Khanda Rao , a brother of Prithvi Raj . . In the time of the Sultan Alauddin Khilji , the Mahal received the jagirs of Samana and Malkana . The Mahal were in popular estimation , considered to a be a Mulla Jat tribe , and most members consider themselves to be Jats. # The Family of the Nawabs of Karnal # The most prominent Mahal family was that of the Nawabs of Karnal . They first appear in history in 1780 A , D , when the family was residing at Samana , Nawab Majid-ul-daula granted to Nawab Sher-ul-din Khan , their ancestor , the parganas of Muzaffarnagar , Shoran and Chitrawal in the Muzaffarnagar District on condition that he furnished for Government service 200 horsemen fully equipped ; on the death of the grantee in 1789 the grant was continued on the same terms to his brother Mahomdi Khan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his nephew Mahomed Ishaq and his cousin Ghairat AH Khan were in possession of these estates , and , in accordance with the policy of Lord Cornwalis , they were induced to accept a tract west of the Jumna in exchange . Thus the Mandals came to settle in Karnal . It is very doubtful whether Mr. Ibbetson 's idea of the Mandal descent is correct ; he has given no reasons , for his assertion and , beyond the fact that the Mandals follow some of the Jat customs , there appears to be no ground for believing them to belong to that tribe . On their seals the ancestors of the present Mandals called themselves Mandal-i-Nausherani , i.e. , the Mandal of the * ' Nausheranis , and we have to decide the meaning of this term . Nausherwan was a Persian King and Nausherwani chiefs have held sway at Kharan in Baluchistan since the 17th century . It appears from inquiries made there and from the Baluchistan Gazetteer that certain Nausherwan proceeded with Abdulla Khan of Kalat , when he accompanied Nadir Shah for the invasion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Nausherani family remained at Samana in possession of a tract which was then conquered , and that the present Mandals are descended from him . The meaning of the term ** Mandal as applied to this family is not certain ; in Shakespear 's dictionary the word , spelt with a hard ** d , is translated as a circle , halo ; a region , country ; a round tent ; an officer employed in villages , exciseman , while that spelt with a soft ** d is said to mean ** a kind of wooden drum ; a fountain . Ibbetson refers to ' * Mandila as meaning a plat- form on which guns are mounted . Of all these meanings the most probable is the exciseman or village officer , and it seems likely that an ancestor of the family was a Nausherwani who was left in charge of Samana or some other place during the raid of Nadir Shah in order to collect taxes there , that he was therefore called ' * Mandal-i-Nausherani , and that he and his successors managed to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for adventurers and those who conquer and settle in foreign lands to adopt some of the customs of the people among whom they have come , and this would account for the Mandals following certain of the Jat customs . The fact that the affix Khan has been used by the family since they were first heard of in this neighbourhood , and that the first known member bore the title of Nawab , tends to support the theory that they formerly belonged to the Nausherani family of Baluchistan . Nawab Ahmad AH Khan , gave assisted the British authorities during the mutiny and for his services the quit-rent of Rs. 5,000 payable by him was remitted in perpetuity ; he was also presented with a khillat of Rs. 10,000 in Darbar and permitted to retain two cannon and one hundred armed retainers ; these honours have been continued to his suc- cessors . He died in 1867 and was succeeded by Azmat AH Khan , his eldest surviving son , who was given the title of Nawab Bahadur . Azmat AH Khan died childless in 1909 , and his half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nawab and the jagir , while he and his brother Muhammad Umar Daraz AH Khan inherited his estate . Before his death Azmat AH Khan , who was on bad terms with his half brothers , attempted to alienate his property , but it was brought under the Court of Wards and there is now litigation by the would-be donees to obtain possession thereof . For good services Rustam Ali Khan received the personal title of Nawab Bahadur and Umar Daraz AH Khan that of Khan Bahadur . The latter was also an Honorary Sub-Registrar , Munsif and Magistrate of the 1st class . Liaquat Ali Khan , the first Prime Minister of Pakistan , was the younger son of Rustam Ali Khan . The fact that the Samana branch spoke Punjabi , has historically created debates over the ethnic identity of Liaquat . Both the Karnal and Muzaffarnagar branches of the tribe spoke Urdu , as did other Mulla Jats. # Present situation # Presently , both the Samana and Karnal branches of the tribe emigrated to Pakistan , many are now found in the city of Punjab and Sindh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India .

It had its premiere on 20 February 1983. # Plot # The film starts from the position close to the literary inspiration suggested in the title , but rather from developing it in the same manner as the novel it is used as a witty commentary on the political situation of Poland in the period of the Polish People 's Republic .

4 Abraham Garton was a Jewish printer who printed the first dated Hebrew book in Europe in 1475 . Unfortunately , very little is known about the personal life of Abraham ben Garton . Most scholars believe he was born in Spain , and emigrated to Calabria , Italy prior to the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 . Many other Spanish Sephardim also emigrated to Calabria following the expulsion . Garton 's first book was Rashi 's commentary on the written Torah . This was printed in the city of Reggio di Calabria , in February , 1475 . Although Garton 's book is the first dated printed edition , the work is neither the first edition of Rashi 's commentary , nor the first book to be printed in Hebrew . Between 1469 and 1472 three brothers , Obadiah , Menasseh , and Benjamin of Rome , were active as the first Hebrew typographers . Six works are positively known to have come off their press , among which was the first , albeit undated edition of Rashi 's commentary .

4 Recorded = 9 November 1969 , Oakland County Coliseum , Oakland , California , United States Language = English ' ' Live'r Than You 'll Ever Be ' ' is a bootleg recording of The Rolling Stones ' concert in Oakland , California from 9 November 1969 . It was one of the first live rock music bootlegs and was made notorious as a document of their 1969 tour of the United States . The popularity of the bootleg forced the Stones ' label Decca Records to release the live album ' ' Get Yer Ya-Yas Out ! The Rolling Stones in Concert ' ' in 1970 . ' ' Live'r ' ' is also one of the earliest commercial bootleg recordings in rock history , released in December 1969 , just two months after the Beatles ' ' ' Kum Back ' ' and five months after Bob Dylan 's ' ' Great White Wonder ' ' . Like the two earlier records , ' ' Live'r s outer sleeve is plain white , with its name stamped on in black ink . # Recording and release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' was recorded by Dub Taylor from Trademark of Quality using a Sennheiser shotgun microphone and a Uher Report 4000 reel-to-reel tape recorder . It was the first audience-recorded rock bootleg to be mastered and distributed ; some sources consider it the first live bootleg . Though the sound is not nearly as clear as the official release of ' ' Get Yer Ya-Ya 's Out ! ' ' , the recording is considered to be very strong for an audience recording , especially one of that era . The Rolling Stones performed two sets that night and it is the second concert that was more heavily bootlegged and has sharper sound . Bootleggers had collaborated to record Stones shows across the United States , recording them on two-track Sony recorders for months prior to the release of the album . At least one source claims that the recordings initially came from rock promoter Bill Graham 's staff , who used the tapes for broadcast on KSAN and released their edit on Lurch Records in early 1970 . The recording was made available about one month after the concert , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released ' ' Ya-Ya 's ' ' as a response to the bootleg and the quality was high enough that it was rumoured that the band had even released the bootleg themselves . The recording has been released through several bootleg labels , including the original release by Trademark of Quality ( catalogue number 71002 ) , Swingin ' Pig , and Sister Morphine , usually documenting only the second set .

The album also received praise as a more authentic example of the Stones on stage because ' ' Get Yer Ya-Ya 's Out ! ' ' was heavily overdubbed in many places . Richie Unterberger has noted that the recording is inferior to the sound quality of ' ' Ya-Ya 's ' ' , but displays a spontaneity that the official recording lacks and this helps to explain its long-lasting appeal to fans . Reviewing the album in 1970 , Wim Wenders called it the best Rolling Stones record . The album would eventually sell enough copies to qualify for a gold record RIAA certification , with TMOQ sources claiming that it had sold 250,000 copies by November 1970150,000 of which were produced by other bootleggers .

514 ' ' Smith and Snipes Hall Farm Ltd v River Douglas Catchment Board ' ' 1949 2 KB 500 is an English land law and English contract law case , notable for Denning LJ 's views concerning privity of contract . # Facts # The River Douglas Catchment Board agreed with a number of landowners between the River Douglas and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal ) to carry out some work if some contribution to the cost was given . In 1940 Mrs S , one of the covenantees , sold her land ( Low Meadows ) to Smith , which incorporated Snipes Hall Farm Ltd in 1944 . In Autumn 1946 the Ellen Brook burst its banks and flooded Smith and Snipes Hall Farm land . They made a claim against the Board for damages in tort and breach of contract . The question was whether not having been privy to the original agreement was a bar to any recovery . # Judgment # The Court of Appeal all held that the Board was in breach of contract , and that breach caused damage to the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attach to the land , and it would not matter whose hands the land came into : the owner could enforce the covenant . Because the covenant ran with the land , under section 78 Law of Property Act 1925 it could be enforced by the covenantee and successors in title . Denning LJ 's notable decision went as follows . On those facts it is my opinion that the board broke their contract . It was an implied term that they should do the work with reasonable care and skill , so as to make the banks reasonably fit for the purpose of preventing flooding . The proper way of doing this , according to the experts , was to put a clay core in the banks , or to make them very much wider , but they did not do either . It may be that the board had not sufficient funds available to carry out such works ; but that seems to me to be an irrelevant consideration , or , at any rate , just as irrelevant in the case of a public board as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was engaged to make works for a specific purpose could excuse himself for bad results by saying that he had not sufficient money to erect proper works . It follows , therefore , that if the original landowner with whom the agreement was made had himself cultivated the fields , and suffered damage by the breach , he could recover from the board . But he sold the land and he has suffered no damage . The damage has been suffered partly by the man who purchased the land , but principally by the tenants , and the question is whether they can sue on the contract . Mr. Nield says that the plaintiffs can not sue . He says that there is no privity of contract between them and the board , and that it is a fundamental principle that no one can sue upon a contract to which he is not a party . That argument can be met either by admitting the principle and saying that it does not apply to this case , or by disputing the principle itself . I make so bold as to dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is sometimes supposed to be . It did not become rooted in our law until the year 1861 ( ' ' Tweddle v Atkinson ' ' , and reached its full growth in 1915 ( ' ' Dunlop v Selfridge ' ' ) . It has never been able entirely to supplant another principle whose roots go much deeper . I mean the principle that a man who makes a deliberate promise which is intended to be binding , that is to say , under seal or for good consideration , must keep his promise ; and the court will hold him to it , not only at the suit of the party who gave the consideration , but also at the suit of one who was not a party to the contract , provided that it was made for his benefit and that he has a sufficient interest to entitle him to enforce it , subject always , of course , to any defences that may be open on the merits . It is upon this principle , implicit if not expressed ( i. ) that the courts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the owner of land for its benefit can be enforced against the covenantor , not only by the original party , but also by his successors in title . ( See ' ' The Prior 's case ' ' , which is set out by Lord Coke in his work on Littleton , at p. 384a , and in his report of ' ' Spencer 's case ' ' ) ; ( ii. ) that the Courts of Common Law in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries repeatedly enforced promises expressly made in favour of an interested person ; ( See ' ' Dutton v Poole ' ' , approved by Lord Mansfield in ' ' Martyn v Hind ' ' ) ; ( iii. ) that Lord Mansfield held that an undisclosed principal is entitled to sue on a contract made by his agent for his benefit , even though nothing was said about agency in the contract ; ( See ' ' Rabone v Williams ' ' cited in ' ' George v Clagett ' ' ) ; and ( iv. ) that Lord Hardwicke decided that a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the contract an intention by one of the parties to contract as trustee for him , even though nothing was said about any trust in the contract , and there was no trust fund to be administered . ( See ' ' Tomlinson v Gill ' ' . ) Throughout the history of the principle the difficulty has been , of course , to say what is sufficient interest to entitle the third person to recover . It has sometimes been supposed that there must always be something in the nature of a trust for his benefit . ( See ' ' Vandepitte 's case ' ' . ) But this is an elusive test which does not explain all the cases , and it involves the trustee being made a nominal party to the action either as plaintiff or defendant , unless that formality is dispensed with , as it was in ' ' Les Affrteurs Runis Socit Anonyme v Leopold Walford Ltd ' ' . The truth is that the principle is not so limited . It may be difficult to define what is a sufficient interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public disadvantage , it does cover the protection of the legitimate property , rights and interests of the third person , although no agency or trust for him can be inferred . It covers , therefore , rights such as these which can not justly be denied ; the right of a seller to enforce a commercial credit issued in his favour by a bank , under contract with the buyer ; the right of a widow to sue for a pension which her husband 's employers promised to pay her under contract with him ; ( See ' ' Dutton v Poole ' ' and cf. ' ' In re Schebsman ' ' ) ; or the right of a man 's servants and guests to claim on an insurance policy , taken out by him against loss by burglary which is expressed to cover them ; cf ' ' Prudential Staff Union v Hall ' ' . In some cases the legislature itself has intervened , as , for instance , to give the driver of a motor car the right to sue on an insurance policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver . But this does not mean that the common law would not have reached the same result by itself . The particular application of the principle with which we are concerned here is the case of covenants made with the owner of the land to which they relate . The law on this subject was fully expounded by Mr. Smith in his note to ' ' Spencer 's case ' ' which has always been regarded as authoritative . Such covenants are clearly intended , and usually expressed , to be for the benefit of whomsoever should be the owner of the land for the time being ; and at common law each successive owner has a sufficient interest to sue because he holds the same estate as the original owner . The reason which Lord Coke gave for this rule is the reason which underlies the whole of the principle now under consideration . He said in his work upon Littleton that it was to give damages to the party grieved . If a successor in title were not allowed to sue it would mean that the covenantor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that the original owner , after he has parted with the land , could recover no more than nominal damages for any breach that occurred thereafter . It was always held , however , at common law that , in order that a successor in title should be entitled to sue , he must be of the same estate as the original owner . That alone was a sufficient interest to entitle him to enforce the contract . The covenant was supposed to be made for the benefit of the owner and his successors in title , and not for the benefit of anyone else . This limitation , however , was , as is pointed out in Smith 's Leading Cases , capable of being productive of very serious and disagreeable consequences , and it has been removed by s. 78 of the Law of Property Act 1925 , which provides that a covenant relating to any land of the covenantee shall be deemed to be made with the covenantee and his successors in title , and the persons deriving title under him or them and shall have effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The covenant of the catchment board in this case clearly relates to the land of the covenantees . It was a covenant to do work on the land for the benefit of the land . By the statute , therefore , it is to be deemed to be made , not only with the original owner , but also with the purchasers of the land and their tenants as if they were expressed . Now if they were expressed , it would be clear that the covenant was made for their benefit ; and they clearly have sufficient interest to entitle them to enforce it because they have suffered the damage . The result is that the plaintiffs come within the principle whereby a person interested can sue on a contract expressly made for his benefit . I would not wish to leave this subject without referring also to s. 56 of the Law of Property Act , 1925 , which says that a person may take the benefit of any covenant or agreement respecting land or other property , although he may not be named as a party to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greene has said , confined to cases when the person seeking to take advantage of it is a person within the benefit of the covenant or agreement ; ( See ' ' White v Bijou Mansions ' ' ) ; but , subject to that limitation , there is no reason why the section should not be given its full scope , just as Lord Dunedin was prepared to give full scope to its narrower predecessor , s. 5 of the Real Property Act 1845 . ( See ' ' Dyson v Forster ' ' . ) Section 56 means , therefore , that a person may enforce an agreement respecting property made for his benefit , although he was not a party to it . So construed it is a clear statutory recognition of the principle to which I have referred and it is applicable to this case . If the principle had been canvassed in ' ' In re Miller 's Agreement ' ' , it should , I think have been held there that the daughters had a right at common law to sue for their pension , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not believe that the covenantors there could break their contract with impunity . So much for the question of principle . Mr. Nield did urge that the benefit of the covenant should not run with the land here because there was no clearly defined piece of land to which it was attached . It is true that the agreement did not describe the lands by metes and bounds , but it did give a description of them which was capable of being rendered certain by extrinsic evidence ; and that is sufficient . Id certum est quod certum reddi potest . Mr. Nield also argued that there was no servient tenement . But that is only material when there is a question whether the burden of a covenant runs with the land . This is a question of the benefit running , and ever since ' ' The Prior 's case ' ' it has been held that the covenantor is liable because of his covenant given to the owner of the dominant tenement and not because of his relationship to any servient tenement . In my opinion , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for breach of covenant . It is thus unnecessary to consider whether they are liable in tort , but I will add a word about it . The decision of the House of Lords , in the ' ' East Suffolk case ' ' , shows that , in the absence of a contract , a catchment board is under no duty to exercise its powers with efficiency or dispatch or at all ; but it also shows that if it does exercise its powers it must use reasonable care not to injure persons likely to be affected by its operations . The present case is very different from that one , because here the landowners , in consequence of the works done by the board , ploughed up the land and cultivated the fields ; and in the result suffered damage which they would not have done if the board had done nothing , for in that case they would have had no crops there . The decision of the House of Lords does show , however , that , in considering whether the board broke its duty in tort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works which it is said they ought to have constructed . An adjacent landowner must not be too critical if the board prefers thrift to efficiency , I suppose on the principle that he should not look a gift horse in the mouth and must be prepared to take it with some faults . But the duty in contract is a very different thing . There is no question of a gift horse there . The landowner paid his contribution in return for the board 's promise , and they are in duty bound to fulfil it . I agree , therefore , that the appeal should be allowed .

4 ' ' Hall Street Associates , L.L.C. v. Mattel , Inc. ' ' , , was a United States Supreme Court case which held that state and federal courts can not , on a motion to vacate or modify an arbitration award , expand the limited scope of judicial review specified in 9 U.S.C. 10 and 11 , including terms agreed upon by the parties . # Facts of the Case # Toy manufacturer Mattel was sued by its landlord Hall Street Associates in a dispute over a property lease , the property being a former View-Master factory in Beaverton , Oregon . After the litigation went to federal court both parties agreed to resolve the case by arbitration according to the procedures outlined in the Federal Arbitration Act ( FAA ) . Atypically , the parties ' arbitration agreement stipulated that the District Court could override the arbitrator 's decision if the arbitrator 's conclusions of law are erroneous . This provision of the agreement granted the federal courts a much broader role in supervising the arbitration than is specifically granted in the FAA . The Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts can override an arbitration award , such as corruption , partiality , or misbehavior on the part of the arbitrator . The arbitrator heard the parties ' arguments and handed down a decision in favor of Mattel . Hall sought review from the District Court , and that court found that the arbitrator 's decision contained legally erroneous conclusions . Accordingly , the arbitrator ruled for Hall Street , and the District Court affirmed . On appeal , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the original arbitration award favoring Mattel must stand . Even if the arbitrator did make legal errors , it was not the place of the courts to review the soundness of the arbitrator 's decision . The Ninth Circuit viewed the FAA 's list of circumstances meriting judicial review as an exclusive list . As far as the original arbitration agreement expanded the scope of judicial review of the arbitration , the agreement could not be enforced . # Decision # In a 6-3 decision , not only did the Supreme Court reject the argument that parties to a contract could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts can not expand it , even for extraordinary circumstances . # Aftermath # Because the Supreme Court rejected any sort of expansion whatsoever to the limited scope of judicial review stated in 9 U.S.C. 10 and 11 , other courts , such as the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit , have also rejected other , judicially created exceptions , such as manifest disregard for the law . Previously , the Eighth Circuit had recognized manifest disregard as a grounds to vacate an arbitration award , defining manifest disregard as when the arbitrators were fully aware of the existence of a clearly defined governing legal principle , but refused to apply it , in effect , ignoring it . . However , after the Supreme Court passed its ruling in ' ' Hall Street ' ' , the Eighth Circuit changed its holding and held that even manifest disregard is not a sufficient grounds to vacate an arbitration award .

4 sizepopulation = 739,956 The DeKalb County Police Department ( DKPD ) is the primary law enforcement agency for unincorporated DeKalb County , Georgia . The department serves a population of more than 730,000 people . The chief is Dr. Cedric Alexander . # History # The DeKalb County Police Department was founded on December 18 , 1915 . On two occasions , in 1923 and 1931 , the department was eliminated , as the county commissioners felt that the department was not serving the best interests of the public . In both cases the department was quickly reinstated . In the early years the department had only a handful of officers . Hiring was sporadic , there was no chief , and officers worked out of the DeKalb County Solicitor 's Office . From the department 's inception until the end of prohibition in 1933 , a DeKalb County Police officer 's primary responsibility was to apprehend bootleggers . Officers Samuel Gentry , Lewell Henderson , Miles Phillips , and Charles Wright were all killed in incidents involving suspected bootleggers . At the beginning of the 1940s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under County Commissioner Scott Candler , a program was started to expand and better train and equip the department , starting with the introduction of two-way car radios . The radio system afforded officers greater mobility and increased their effectiveness , before the radio system , officers had to regularly call in from pay phones for instructions . The radios , along with the addition of a new fleet of patrol cars in 1949 allowed officers to quickly respond to calls , that same year DeKalb Police moved into headquarters located in the county complex on Camp drive.in the 1950s the department added more officers , formed Traffic Enforcement , Criminal Investigation , and a Records and Identification section , and responsibilities between the Sheriff and the Police Dept. were more clearly defined . By 1960 the department had grown to over 100 officers , and efforts were made for Dekalb to organize their own Academy . By 1968 , the department had expanded to a force of approximately 200 officers , and added new Specialized Investigation units such as Robbery/Homicide , Juvenile and Narcotics to the Dept . In 1972 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received their first Helicopter , a Hughes model 300C when the Dept. moved into a newly built public safety complex on Camp Circle in Decatur which when constructed had a Helipad installed on the roof . The department would remain at this location for more than thirty years . The location is still the home to several units within the police department.by the mid 70 's the Dept , formed a SWAT unit , combined several investigative functions into a Major Felony Unit , and fielded mobile Crime Scene , Accident Reconstruction and Community relations units.massive growth in Dekalb required the ranks to expand to over 500 officers . In 2006 the DeKalb County Police department had outgrew its headquarters and moved to its current headquarters at 1960 W. Exchange Place in Tucker . As metropolitan Atlanta grew , so did the DeKalb County Police Department . In the last forty years , DKPD has expanded from 200 officers to its current staff of 1,112 sworn officers and 498 support staff ( as of 2011 ) making it the second largest police department in Georgia . With the incorporation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City of Brookhaven in 2013 , most of North Precinct 's patrol area was absorbed into these cities . As a result , the precinct was closed on August 17 , 2013 , reducing the department 's total number of precincts from five to four . The murder of Officer William David Corn on February 1 , 1972 is the agency 's only unsolved police murder . # Specialized units # The following is a partial list of specialized units within the department : Traffic Specialist Unit ( TSU ) : Responsible for investigating traffic fatalities and hit-and-runs . SWAT Team : Responsible for serving high-risk warrants , performing hostage rescues , and defusing other high-risk situations . The department maintains a full-time SWAT team which is augmented by part-time members who serve in other positions throughout the department . S.T.A.R . Team : The S.T.A.R . ( strategic traffic accident reduction ) Team is responsible for providing specialized enforcement of driving under the influence ( DUI ) , aggressive driving , and speeding laws . Aerial Support Unit : The Aerial Support Unit operates two Eurocopter AS-350 B-2 helicopters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras that allow the flight crew to locate individuals in total darkness . The helicopters are also equipped with 30 million candlepower spotlights and Lojack systems for locating stolen vehicles . The Aerial Support Unit is the only law enforcement unit in the southeast with chemical monitoring capability . # Precincts # The department operates four precincts : * North-Central Precinct , 1960 W.

Tucker , Georgia 30084 # Bolton controversy # In late 2006 , then-county CEO Vernon Jones hired Terrell Bolton to serve as chief of police . Bolton had previously been the chief of the Dallas Police Department , and was terminated by that agency in 2003 . Bolton 's tenure with the DeKalb Police was fraught with controversy . The chief was accused of taking unauthorized time off work and misusing luxury vehicles seized by the department . In February 2009 , under mounting pressure from the media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected county CEO Burrell Ellis placed Bolton on administrative leave . Bolton was terminated shortly after being placed on leave . In a letter sent to Bolton , Ellis outlined his reasons for terminating the chief . The letter provided examples of Bolton 's insubordination , misuse of county property , and conduct unbecoming an officer .

4 ' ' On the Jellicoe Road ' ' is a young adult novel by Australian novelist Melina Marchetta . It was first published in Australia in 2006 by Penguin Australia under the title ' ' On the Jellicoe Road ' ' , where it was awarded the 2008 West Australia Young Readers Book ( WAYRB ) Award for Older Readers . It was later published in the United States in 2008 under the abbreviated title ' ' Jellicoe Road ' ' by HarperTeen and went on to win the 2009 Michael L. Printz Award from the American Library Association . # Summary # The story is set around the life of Taylor Lily Markham , the 17-year-old leader of the boarding school on the Jellicoe Road ( country NSW/ACT ) . Taylor was abandoned at the 7/11 on the Jellicoe Road by her mother when she was 11 , and her only recollection of her father is a brief memory of standing on her father 's shoulders . The only adult influence in her life is her mentor/guardian Hannah , who lives in the unfinished house by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the 1980s and who has suddenly vanished into thin air at a time when Taylor really needs her . To top all of Taylors problems off , there is a territory war going on between the boarders , the Townies ( kids from the Jellicoe Town ) and the Cadets ( Sydney boys who come for a six-week training exercise every year to Jellicoe ) . The leader of the cadets this year happens to be the very boy who Taylor ran away with when she was 14 in search of her mother . The one who betrayed her trust and she never wants to see again . Running parallel to Taylor 's story is the story that Hannah writes , about the five kids in the 1980s . As Hannah has not yet compiled it , the story is shown in pieces throughout the novel with her handwriting . # Blurb # United States Taylor Markham is not a popular choice . She is erratic , has no people skills and never turns up to meetings . Not to mention the incident when she ran off in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's lived at Jellicoe School most of her life and as leader of the boarders that 's her greatest asset . Especially now the cadets , led by the infamous Jonah Griggs , have arrived . The territory wars between the boarders , townies and cadets are about to recommence . But Taylor has other things on her mind : a prayer tree , the hermit who whispered in her ear , and a vaguely familiar drawing in the local police station . Taylor wants to understand the mystery of her own past . But Hannah , the woman who found her , has suddenly disappeared , leaving nothing but an unfinished manuscript about five kids whose lives entwined twenty years ago on the Jellicoe Road . Australia I 'm dreaming of the boy in the tree . I tell him stories . About the Jellicoe School and the Townies and the Cadets from a school in Sydney . I tell him about the war between us for territory . And I tell him about Hannah , who lives in the unfinished house by the river . Hannah , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hannah , who found me on the Jellicoe Road six years ago . Taylor is the leader of the boarders at the Jellicoe School . She has to keep the upper hand in territory wars and deal with Jonah Griggs- the enigmatic leader of the cadets , and someone who she thought she would never see again . And now Hannah , the person Taylor had come to rely on , has disappeared . Taylor 's only clue is a manuscript about five kids who lived in Jellicoe eighteen years ago . She needs to find out more , but this means confronting her own story , making sense of her strange , recurring dream , and finding her mother- who abandoned her on the Jellicoe Road . # Characters # Taylor Lily Markham Taylor is the 17-year-old leader of the boarders at Jellicoe School , which is located on the Jellicoe Road , ' where trees make breezy canopies like a tunnel to the Shangri-la ' , outside the fictional town of Jellicoe . ( Located somewhere in rural New South Wales , north of Yass ) . Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood living on the streets with her mother and squatting from town to town . However her life changed when she was 11 , and her mother dropped her off at the 7-11 on the Jellicoe Road , and then drove away . Minutes later , a young woman named Hannah came and picked her up , and then took her to the Jellicoe School - and it 's where Taylor 's been ever since . Taylor 's character is difficult to imagine . The memories of her past have changed the person she is today . Most of the time she is lost in her own world , but she is prone to depression , anxiety , asthma and being unfriendly towards others . She has no idea who her father is and her only memory of him is standing on his shoulders and reaching for the sky . Taylor 's appearance describes her as being tall for her age with light brown hair and blue/green eyes . Jonah Griggs The leader of the Cadets from Sydney , Jonah is described as a ' ten foot tank . ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violent childhood , from his father who used to verbally , physically and mentally abuse his mother , his younger brother Daniel and himself . When he was 14 , Jonah 's father was in one of his rages and so the young Jonah whacked him over the head with a cricket bat , which ultimately caused his father 's death . Jonah , who was traumatized by this act , attempted to commit suicide by jumping in front of a train , but , on the day he planned it , he met Taylor and he decided he did n't want to kill himself in front of her . So instead he catches the train with her , and they travel to Yass . Once they get off , they attempt to hitchhike with a postman to Sydney where Taylor 's mother is supposed to be , but Jonah has a dream from his dead father saying ' if you go any further , you wo n't come back . ' ( although it is revealed later that the postman they rode with was the serial killer that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) So that night , Jonah rings his school , and the next day the Brigadier shows up and takes them both back to Jellicoe . Taylor sees this act as a great betrayal , and she refuses to speak to Jonah again . Chaz Santangelo The incredibly good looking Italian/Aboriginal leader of the Townies ( townsfolk of Jellicoe ) , Chaz is the son of the Chief of Police , Sal and the Mayor , Clara . He is the eldest child and only son , with four younger female siblings - Mary , Elisha , Tilly and Sarah Santangelo who often drive him insane . He 's a sentimental , wise and fair person , who eventually becomes good friends with Taylor and Jonah , and continues to have a highly complicated relationship with Raffy , his childhood friend and complicated love interest . They both attended Jellicoe Primary school , where they were obviously close . Raffy and Chaz 's families are also very close , with him once breaking into the school because Raffy 's mum left her teacher 's chronicle there . Raffy was born a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attends the Jellicoe School . Her parents are teachers in the town of Jellicoe and she went to Primary School with Chaz Santagelo . She was his best friend there , and even his romantic interest . Both their families are good friends . She seems to know the moves of the Townies and often uses her past relationship with Chaz to Jellicoe school 's advantage . Raffy is considered to be a traitor by Chaz and the Townies for attending Jellicoe School . She was an outsider at Jellicoe School in her younger years , along with Taylor and Ben , the Violinist . As she progresses to the senior year levels , she becomes more popular , and looks after the younger levels , mothering them . This mothering also comes into play with her friendship with Taylor . She has long brown hair and is mentioned to be religious several times , although not of the common sense .

514 The Magazine cover indicator is a somewhat irreverent economic indicator , though sometimes taken seriously by technical analysts , which says that the cover story on the major business magazines , particularly ' ' BusinessWeek ' ' , ' ' Forbes ' ' and ' ' Fortune ' ' in the United States is often a contrary indicator . A famous example is a 1979 cover of ' ' BusinessWeek ' ' titled The Death of Equities . The ' 70s had been a generally bad decade for the stock market and at the time the article was written the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 800 . However , 1979 roughly marked a turning point , and stocks went on to enjoy a bull market for the better part of two decades . Even after the financial crisis of 20072010 , stocks remain far above their 1979 levels . Using the Magazine Cover Indicator , ' ' Business Week s projection that equities were dead should have been a buy signal . By the time an idea has had time to make its way to the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has likely run its course . Similarly , good news on a cover can be taken as an ill omen . As Paul Krugman has joked Whom the Gods would destroy , they first put on the cover of ' ' Business Week ' ' . Although there are a number of examples where magazines have been wrong , even spectacularly wrong , there is a tendency to ignore all the times the covers are right . In January 2008 , for example , ' ' Business Week ' ' ran a cover story entitled Meltdown ; For Housing the Worst Is Yet To Come and in July 2008 a cover story called The Home Price Abyss ; Why the threat of a free fall is growing and indeed , for the rest of 2008 and into 2009 home prices continued to plummet . An investor who interpreted the magazine covers as a contrary indicator and purchased real estate would have lost much of his investment . # References #

4 birthplace = Moscow , Russia deathplace = Moscow , Russia Michael I of Russia ( Russian : , ' ' Mikhail Fyodorovich Romanov ' ' ) ( 12 July 1596 &amp;ndash ; 12 July 1645 ) was the first Russian Tsar of the house of Romanov . He was the son of Feodor Nikitich Romanov ( later known as Patriarch Filaret ) and Xenia ( later known as the ' ' great nun ' ' Martha ) . His reign marked the end of the Time of Troubles . # Life and reign # Michael 's grandfather , Nikita , was brother to the earlier Tsarina Anastasia and a central adviser to Ivan the Terrible . As a young boy , Michael and his mother had been exiled to Beloozero in 1600 . This was a result of the recently elected Tsar Boris Godunov , in 1598 , falsely accusing his father of treason . This may have been partly because Nikita had married Ksenia Shestova against Boris ' wishes . Michael was unanimously elected Tsar of Russia by a national assembly on 21 February 1613 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tsar and his mother at the Ipatiev Monastery near Kostroma until 24 March . He had been chosen after several other options had been removed , including royalty of Poland and Sweden . Michael was partly chosen for his connection by distant relation to the earlier Tsarina Anastasia , the wife of Ivan IV . Initially , Martha protested , believing and stating that her son was too young and tender for so difficult an office , and in such a troublesome time . The weeping boyars solemnly declared that if he persisted in his refusal , they would hold him responsible to God for the destruction of Russia . Michael eventually consented to accept the throne . Michael 's election and accession to the throne form the basis of the Ivan Susanin legend , which Russian composer Mikhail Glinka dramatized in his opera ' ' A Life for the Tsar ' ' . In so dilapidated a condition was the capital at this time that Michael had to wait for several weeks at the Troitsa monastery , 75 mi off , before decent accommodation could be provided for him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first task of the new tsar was to clear the land of the countries occupying it . Sweden and Poland were then dealt with respectively by the peace of Stolbovo ( 17 February 1617 ) and the Truce of Deulino ( 1 December 1618 ) . The most important result of the Truce of Deulino was the return from exile of the tsar 's father , who henceforth took over the government till his death in October 1633 , Michael occupying quite a subordinate position . Tsar Michael suffered from a progressing leg injury ( a consequence of a horse accident early in his life ) , which resulted in his not being able to walk towards the end of his life . He was a gentle and pious prince who gave little trouble to anyone and effaced himself behind his counsellors . Sometimes they were relatively honest and capable men like his father ; sometimes they were corrupted and bigoted , like the Saltykov relatives of his mother . He was married twice , first to Princess Maria Vladimirovna Dolgorukova in 1624 , who died four months after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eudoxia Streshneva ( 1608&amp;ndash ; 1645 ) , who brought him 10 children . Michael 's failure to wed his daughter Irene of Russia with Count Valdemar Christian of Schleswig-Holstein , a morganatic son of King Christian IV of Denmark , in consequence of the refusal of the latter to accept Orthodoxy , so deeply afflicted him as to contribute to bringing about his death on 12 July 1645. # Michael 's governments # The two most important politically government offices ( prikazes ) were Posolsky Prikaz ( Foreign Office ) and Razryadny Prikaz ( a Duma chancellery and a personnel department for both central and provincial administration including military command ) . Those offices could be pivotal in struggles between Boyar factions , so they were traditionally headed not by Boyars but by dyak ( professional clerks ) . The first head of the Posolsky Prikaz under Michael was Pyotr Tretyakov until his death in 1618 ; he conducted policy of allying with Sweden against Poland . The next one , Ivan Gramotin had a reputation of a Poloniphile ; this appointment was necessary to bring forth Filaret 's release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Poland ; Gramotin fell in his disfavour and was fired and exiled in 1626 . The same fate was shared by Efim Telepnev in 1630 and Fedor Likhachov in 1631 - they too tried to soothe Filaret 's belligerent approach . Ivan Gryazev , appointed in 1632 , was promoted from second ranks of bureaucracy to fulfill Filaret 's orders . After Filaret 's and Gryazev 's deaths the post was once again assumed by Gramotin in 1634 , and after the latter 's retirement in 1635 , by Likhachov , with general course on pacification . Razryadny Prikaz was first headed by Sydavny Vasilyev ; Filaret replaced him by his fellow in captivity Tomilo Lugovskoy , but the latter somehow caused Filaret 's anger and was exiled . In 1623 Fedor Likhachov was made head of Prikaz till his shift to Posolsky Prikaz , and in 1630 Razryad was given to Ivan Gavrenev , an outstanding administrator who took up this post for 30 years . Three other strategic offices were Streletsky Prikaz ( in charge of streltsy regiments who served as Moscow garrison ) , Treasury ( Prikaz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact ministry of health , most particularly the tsar 's health ) . After Filaret 's arrival their former heads were sent away from Moscow , and all three given to Ivan Cherkassky ( Filaret 's nephew ) , who proved to be an able and competent administrator and was a de facto prime minister till his death in 1642 . Fedor Sheremetev who had succeeded to all Cherkassky 's posts was a rather weak figure ; the real power was in the hands of a court marshal , Alexey Lvov. # Issue # From his marriage to Eudoxia Streshneva , Michael fathered 10 children : border= 1 style= border-collapse : collapse ; !

4 Catholic bishops in Nazi Germany differed in their responses to the rise of Nazi Germany , World War II , and the Holocaust during the years 19331945 . In the 1930s , the Episcopate of the Catholic Church of Germany comprised 6 Archbishops and 19 bishops while German Catholics comprised around one third of the population of Germany served by 20,000 priests . In the lead up to the 1933 Nazi takeover , German Catholic leaders were outspoken in their criticism of Nazism . Following the Nazi takeover , the Catholic Church sought an accord with the Government , was pressured to conform , and faced persecution . The regime had flagrant disregard for the Reich concordat with the Holy See , and the episcopate had various disagreements with the Nazi government , but it never declared an official sanction of the various attempts to overthrow the Hitler regime . Ian Kershaw wrote that the churches engaged in a bitter war of attrition with the regime , receiving the demonstrative backing of millions of churchgoers . Applause for Church leaders whenever they appeared in public , swollen attendances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed church services were outward signs of the struggle of .. especially of the Catholic Church - against Nazi oppression . While the Church ultimately failed to protect its youth organisations and schools , it did have some successes in mobilizing public opinion to alter government policies . The German bishops initially hoped for a quid pro quo that would protect Catholic schools , organisations , publications and religious observance . While head of the Bishop 's Conference Adolf Bertram persisted in a policy of avoiding confrontation on broader issues of human rights , the activities of Bishops such as Konrad von Preysing , Joseph Frings and August von Galen came to form a coherent , systematic critique of many of the teachings of Nazism . Kershaw wrote that , while the detestation of Nazism was overwhelming within the Catholic Church , it did not preclude church leaders approving of areas of the regime 's policies , particularly where Nazism blended into ' mainstream ' national aspirations like support for patriotic foreign policy or war aims , obedience to state authority ( where this did not contravene divine law ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional Christian anti-Judaism was no bulwark against Nazi biological antisemitism . Such protests as the bishops did make about the mistreatment of the Jews tended to be by way of private letters to government ministers , rather than explicit public pronouncements . From the outset , Pope Pius XI , had ordered the Papal Nuncio in Berlin , Cesare Orsenigo , to look into whether and how it may be possible to become involved in the aid of Jews , but Orsenigo proved a poor instrument in this regard , concerned more with the anti-church policies of the Nazis and how these might effect German Catholics , than with taking action to help German Jews . By 1937 , after four years of persecution , the church hierarchy , which had initially sought to co-operate with the new government , had become highly disillusioned and Pope Pius XI issued the ' ' Mit brennender Sorge ' ' anti-Nazi encyclical , which had been co-drafted by Cardinal Archbishop Michael von Faulhaber of Munich together , with Preysing and Galen and the Vatican Sectretary of State Cardinal Pacelli ( the future Pope Pius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church . The German Bishops condemned the Nazi sterilization law . In 1941 , August von Galen led protests against the Nazi euthanasia programme . In 1941 , a pastoral letter of the German Bishops proclaimed that the existence of Christianity in Germany is at stake , and a 1942 letter accused the government of unjust oppression and hated struggle against Christianity and the Church . At the close of the war , the resistor Joseph Frings , succeeded the appeaser Adolf Bertram as chairman of the Fulda Bishops ' Conference , and , along with Galen and Preysing , was promoted to Cardinal by Pius XII . The Anschluss with Austria increased the number and percentage of Catholics within the Reich . A pattern of attempted co-operation , followed by repression was repeated . At the direction of Cardinal Innitzer , the churches of Vienna pealed their bells and flew swastikas for Hitler 's arrival in the city on 14 March 1938 . However , wrote Mark Mazower , such gestures of accommodation were not enough to assuage the Austrian Nazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Globocnik . Globocnik launched a crusade against the Church , and the Nazis confiscated property , closed Catholic organisations and sent many priests to Dachau . A Nazi mob ransacked Cardinal Innitzer 's residence , after he had denounced Nazi persecution of the Church . In the Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany , the Church faced its most extreme persecution . But after the invasion , Nuncio Orsenigo in Berlin assumed the role of protector of the Church in the annexed regions , in conflict with his role of facilitating better relations with the German government , and his own fascistic sympathies . In 1939 , five of the Polish bishops of the annexed Warthegau region were deported to concentration camps . In Greater Germany through the Nazi period , just one German Catholic bishop was briefly imprisoned in a concentration camp , and just one other expelled from his diocese . # List # ' ' Years in parentheses are the years of their episcopate.

On 10 August 1940 , the president of the Bishops Conference on the one hand begged Hitler to resist influences hostile to Christianity - but at the same time assured the Fuehrer of his loyalty to the state as it is . Only gradually did Catholic resistance from the hierarchy re-emerge , in the form of the efforts of individual clerics , including Cardinal Preysing of Berlin , Bishop Galen of Munster , and Bishop Grober of Freiberg . The regime responded with arrests , the withdrawal of teaching privileges , and the seizure of church publishing houses . Pastoral letters of 1942 and 1943 denounced government breaches of the Concordat and declared support for human rights and rule of law .

Traditional Christian anti-Judaism was no bulwark against Nazi biological antisemitism , wrote Kershaw , and on these issues the churches as institutions felt on uncertain grounds . Opposition was generally left to fragmented and largely individual efforts . Yet from the early stages of Nazism , Nazi ideology and Catholic doctrine clashed - from Alfred Rosenberg 's anti-Catholic stance in ' ' The Myth of the Twentieth Century ' ' , to the Nazi sterilization and euthanasia programs . The Nazis also moved early against the church 's organisational interests - attacking Political Catholicism , Catholic schools and the Catholic press . Against these things , church leaders mounted vigorous defences . ; Preysing Bishop von Preysing was among the most firm and consistent bishops to oppose the Nazis . Preysing served as Bishop of Eichstatt from 1932 to 1935 and in 1935 was appointed as Bishop of Berlin - the capital of Nazi Germany . Preysing was loathed by Hitler , who said the foulest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humility and the foulest of these Count Presying ! What a beast ! . He spoke out in public sermons and argued the case for firm opposition at bishops ' conferences . Bishop von Preysing was one of the Catholic contacts of the Kreisau Circle of the German Resistance . His Advent Pastoral Letters of 1942 and 1943 on the nature of human rights reflected the anti-Nazi theology of the Barmen Declaration of the Confessing Church , leading one to be broadcast in German by the BBC . In 1944 , Preysing met with and gave a blessing to Claus von Stauffenberg , in the lead up to the July Plot to assassinate Hitler , and spoke with the resistance leader on whether the need for radical change could justify tyrannicide . ; Galen The Bishop of Munster , August von Galen was Preysing 's cousin . In response to Nazi Ideologist Alfred Rosenberg ' ' The Myth of the Twentieth Century ' ' , Galen derided the neo-pagan theories of Rosenberg as perhaps no more than an occasion for laughter in the educated world , but warned that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the authentic philosophy of National Socialism and in his almost unlimited power in the field of German education . Herr Rosenberg must be taken seriously if the German situation is to be understood . Often Galen directly protested to Hitler over violations of the Concordat . When in 1936 , Nazis removed crucifixes in schools , protest by Galen led to public demonstration . Like Presying , he assisted with the drafting of the 1937 papal encyclical . He denounced the lawlessness of the Gestapo , the confiscations of church properties and the cruel program of Nazi euthanasia . He attacked the Gestapo for seizing church properties and converting them to their own purposes - including use as cinemas and brothels . His three powerful sermons of July and August 1941 earned him the nickname of the Lion of Munster . Documents suggest the Nazis intended to hang von Galen at the end of the war . Soon after the Nazi takeover , his three Advent sermons of 1933 , entitled ' ' Judaism , Christianity , and Germany ' ' , affirmed the Jewish origins of the Christian religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible , and the importance of the Christian tradition to Germany . According to the Encyclopedia Britannica , Throughout his sermons until the collapse ( 1945 ) of the Third Reich , Faulhaber vigorously criticized Nazism , despite governmental opposition . Attempts on his life were made in 1934 and in 1938 . He worked with American occupation forces after the war , and received the West German Republic 's highest award , the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit . ; Bertram Cardinal Adolf Bertram ' ' ex officio ' ' head of the German episcopate sent Hitler birthday greetings in 1939 in the name of all German Catholic bishops , an act that angered bishop Konrad von Preysing . Bertram was the leading advocate of accommodation as well as the leader of the German church , a combination that reigned in other would-be opponents of Nazism. # The Church Struggle # The Nazis disliked universities , intellectuals and the Catholic and Protestant churches . According to Gill , their long term plan was to de-Christianise Germany after the final victory . The Nazis co-opted the term Gleichschaltung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workers ' Party line : there was to be no law but Hitler , and ultimately no god but Hitler . The Kirchenkampf ( Church struggle ) saw the Nazis attempt to control the religious confessions of Germany . Aggressive anti-Church radicals like Joseph Goebbels and Martin Bormann saw the conflict with the Churches as a priority concern , and anti-church and anti-clerical sentiments were strong among grassroots party activists . Hitler too disdained Christianity . According to Kershaw , the German church leadership expended considerable energies in opposing government interference in the church and attempts to ride roughshod over Christian doctrine and values . While offering something less than fundamental resistance to Nazism , church leaders engaged in a bitter war of attrition with the regime . A threatening , though initially mainly sporadic persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany followed the Nazi takeover . The Reichskonkordat between Germany and the Vatican was signed at the Vatican on 20 July 1933 . Within three months of the signing of the document , Cardinal Bertram , head of the German Catholic Bishops Conference , was writing in a Pastoral Letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's actions towards Catholic organisations , charitable institutions , youth groups , press , Catholic Action and the mistreatment of Catholics for their political beliefs . Prior to 1933 , the Church had been quite hostile to Nazism and its bishops energetically denounced the ' false doctrines ' of the Nazis , however its opposition weakened considerably after the Concordat . Cardinal Bertram developed an ineffectual protest system so satisfy the demands of other bishops , without annoying the regime . Only gradually did Catholic resistance from the hierarchy re-emerge , in the form of the efforts of individual clerics , including Cardinal Preysing of Berlin , Bishop Galen of Munster , and Bishop Grober of Freiberg . The regime responded with arrests , the withdrawal of teaching privileges , and the seizure of church publishing houses . The Concordat , wrote William Shirer , was hardly put to paper before it was being broken by the Nazi Government . On 25 July , the Nazis promulgated their sterilization law , an offensive policy in the eyes of the Catholic Church . Five days later , moves began to dissolve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to be targeted , leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years , often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or immorality . In effort to counter the strength and influence of spiritual resistance , the security services monitored the activities of the bishops very closely - instructing that agents be set up in every diocese , that the bishops ' reports to the Vatican should be obtained and that the bishops ' areas of activity must be found out . Deans were to be targeted as the eyes and ears of the bishops and a vast network established to monitor the activities of ordinary clergy : The importance of this enemy is such that inspectors of security police and of the security service will make this group of people and the questions discussed by them their special concern . In January 1934 , Hitler appointed Alfred Rosenberg as the cultural and educational leader of the Reich . Rosenberg was a neo-pagan and notoriously anti-Catholic . Bishop von Galen derided the neo-pagan theories of Rosenberg as perhaps no more than an occasion for laughter in the educated world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance of his basic notions as the authentic philosophy of National Socialism and in his almost unlimited power in the field of German education . Herr Rosenberg must be taken seriously if the German situation is to be understood . Goebbels noted the mood of Hitler in his diary on 25 October 1936 : Trials against the Catholic Church temporarily stopped . Possibly wants peace , at least temporarily . Now a battle with Bolshevism . Wants to speak with Faulhaber . On November 4 , 1936 , Hitler met Faulhaber . Hitler spoke for the first hour , then Faulhaber told him that the Nazi government had been waging war on the church for three years - 600 religious teachers had lost their jobs in Bavaria alone - and the number was set to rise to 1700 and the government had instituted laws the Church could not accept - like the sterilization of criminals and the handicapped . While the Catholic Church respected the notion of authority , nevertheless , when your officials or your laws offend Church dogma or the laws of morality , and in so doing offend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as responsible defenders of moral laws . Kershaw cites the meeting as an example of Hitler 's ability to pull the wool over the eyes even of hardened critics for Faulhaber - a man of sharp acumen , who had often courageously criticized the Nazi attacks on the Catholic Church - went away convinced that Hitler was deeply religious . By early 1937 , the German bishops , who had initially attempted to co-operate with the new government , had become highly disillusioned . In March , Pope Pius XI issued the ' ' Mit brennender Sorge ' ' ( ) encyclical . It accused the government of systematic hostility leveled at the Church . Bishops Konrad von Preysing and August von Galen helped draft the document . The Nazis responded with , an intensification of the Church Struggle , beginning around April . Goebbels noted heightened verbal attacks on the clergy from Hitler in his diary and wrote that Hitler had approved the start of trumped up immorality trials against clergy and anti-Church propaganda campaign . Goebbels ' orchestrated attack included a staged morality trial of 37 Franciscans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of the need to continue the fight against Political Catholicism and Alfred Rosenberg said that the churches of Germany as they exist at present , must vanish from the life of our people . In the space of a few months , Bishop Sproll of Rothenberg , Cardinal von Faulhaber of Munich and Cardinal Innitzer of Vienna were physically attacked by Nazis . After initially offering support to the Anschluss , Austria 's Cardinal Innitzer became a critic of the Nazis and was subject to violent intimidation from them . With power secured in Austria , the Nazis repeated their persecution of the Church and in October , a Nazi mob ransacked Innitzer 's residence , after he had denounced Nazi persecution of the Church . On 26 July 1941 , Bishop von Galen wrote to the government to complain The Secret Police has continued to rob the property of highly respected German men and women merely because they belonged to Catholic orders . Because the Nazi Gleichschaltung policy of forced coordination encountered such forceful opposition from the churches , Hitler decided to postpone the struggle until after the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing conflict with the Catholic and Protestant Churches in Germany . Though he occasionally spoke of wanting to delay the Church struggle and was prepared to restrain his anti-clericalism out of political considerations , his own inflammatory comments gave his immediate underlings all the license they needed to turn up the heat in the ' Church Struggle , confident that they were ' working towards the Fuhrer ' . # 1941 Pastoral Letter of the German Bishops # On 26 June 1941 , the German Bishops drafted a pastoral letter from their Fulda Conference , to be read from all pulpits on 6 July : Again and again have the bishops brought their justified claims and complaints before the proper authorities .. Through this pastoral declaration the Bishops want you to see the real situation of the church .

It accused the regime of seeking to rid Germany of Christianity : The letter outlined serial breaches of the 1933 Concordat , reitereated complaints of the suffocation of Catholic schooling , presses and hospitals and said that the Catholic faith has been restricted to such a degree that it has disappeared almost entirely from public life and even worship within churches in Germany is frequently restricted or oppressed , while in the conquered territories ( and even in the Old Reich ) , churches had been closed by force and even used for profane purposes . The freedom of speech of clergymen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished for fulfilling priestly duties and incarcerated in Concentration camps without legal process . Religious orders had been expelled from schools , and their properties seized , while seminaries had been confiscated to deprive the Catholic priesthood of successors . The bishops denounced the Nazi euthanasia program and declared their support for human rights and personal freedom under God and just laws of all people : # Austria # The Anschluss saw the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in early 1938 . Austria was overwhelmingly Catholic . At the direction of Cardinal Innitzer , the churches of Vienna pealed their bells and flew swastikas for Hitler 's arrival in the city on 14 March . However , wrote Mark Mazower , such gestures of accommodation were not enough to assuage the Austrian Nazi radicals , foremost among them the young ' ' Gauleiter ' ' Globocnik . Globocnik launched a crusade against the Church , and the Nazis confiscated property , closed Catholic organisations and sent many priests to Dachau . Anger at the treatment of the Church in Austria grew quickly and October 1938 , wrote Mazower , saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new regime , when a rally of thousands left Mass in Vienna chanting Christ is our Fuehrer , before being dispersed by police . A Nazi mob ransacked Cardinal Innitzer 's residence , after he had denounced Nazi persecution of the Church . L'Osservatore Romano reported on 15 October that Hitler Youth and the SA had gathered at Innitzer 's Cathedral during a service for Catholic Youth and started counter-shouts and whistlings : ' Down with Innitzer ! Our faith is Germany ' . The following day , the mob stoned the Cardinal 's residence , broke in and ransacked itbashing a secretary unconscious , and storming another house of the cathedral curia and throwing its curate out the window . In a Table Talk of July 1942 discussing his problems with the Church , Hitler singles out Innitzer 's early gestures of cordiality as evidence of the extreme caution with which Church diplomats must be treated : there appeared a man who addressed me with such self-assurance and beaming countenance , just as if , throughout the whole of the Austrian Republic he had never even touched a hair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # From 1939 , the regime began its program of euthanasia in Nazi Germany , in which those deemed racially unfit were to be euthanased . The senile , the mentally handicapped and mentally ill , epileptics , cripples , children with Down 's Syndrome and people with similar afflictions were all were to be killed . The program involved the systematic murder of more than 70,000 people . Bishop von Galen had the decree printed in his newspaper on 9 March 1941 . Subsequent arrests of priests and seizure of Jesuit properties by the Gestapo in his home city of Munster , convinced Galen that the caution advised by his superior had become pointless . On 6 , 13 and 20 July 1941 , Galen spoke against the seizure of properties , and expulsions of nuns , monks and religious and criticised the euthanasia programme . In an attempt to cow Galen , the police raided his sister 's convent , and detained her in the cellar . She escaped the confinement , and Galen , who had also received news of the imminent removal of further patients , launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August sermon . He declared the murders to be illegal , and said that he had formally accused those responsible for murders in his diocese in a letter to the public prosecutor . The policy opened the way to the murder of all unproductive people , like old horses or cows , including invalid war veterans : Who can trust his doctor anymore ? , he asked . He declared , wrote Evans , that Catholics must avoid those who blasphemed , attacked their religion , or brought about the death of innocent men and women . Otherwise they would become involved in their guilt . Galen said that it was the duty of Christians to resist the taking of human life , even if it meant losing their own lives . The sensation created by the sermons , wrote Richard J. Evans , was enormous . Kershaw characterised Von Galen 's 1941 open attack on the government 's euthanasia program as a vigorous denunciation of Nazi inhumanity and barbarism . According to Gill , Galen used his condemnation of this appalling policy to draw wider conclusions about the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Germany from the regime 's violations of basic human rights . Galen had the sermons read in parish churches . The British broadcast excerpts over the BBC German service , dropped leaflets over Germany , and distributed the sermons in occupied countries . Bishop Antonius Hilfrich of Limburg wrote to the Justice Minister , denouncing the murders . Bishop Albert Stohr of Mainz condemned the taking of life from the pulpit . Some of the priests who distributed the sermons were among those arrested and sent to the concentration camps amid the public reaction to the sermons . Hitler wanted to have Galen removed , but Goebbels told him this would result in the loss of the loyalty of Westphalia . The regional Nazi leader , and Hitler 's deputy Martin Bormann called for Galen to be hanged , but Hitler and Goebbels urged a delay in retribution till war 's end . The Catholic bishops jointly expressed their horror at the policy in their 1942 Pastoral Letter : and designed to calm the conscience through appeals to pity . We German Bishops shall not cease to protest against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless the Commandment , Thou shalt not kill , is observed . Under pressure from growing protests , Hitler halted the main euthanasia program on 24 August 1941 , though less systematic murder of the handicapped continued . While Galen survived , Bishop von Preysing 's Cathedral Administrator , Fr Bernhard Lichtenberg met his demise for protesting directly to Dr Conti , the Nazi State Medical Director . He was arrested soon after and later died en route to Dachau . Some of the priests who distributed the sermons were among those arrested and sent to the concentration camps amid the public reaction to the sermons . # The Holocaust # # Knowledge of # According to historians David Bankier and Hans Mommsen a through knowledge of the Holocaust was well within the reach of the German bishops , if they wanted to find out . According to historian Michael Phayer , a number of bishops did want to know , and they succeeded very early on in discovering what their government was doing to the Jews in occupied Poland . Wilhelm Berning , for example , knew about the systematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one month after the Wannsee Conference . Most German Church historians believe that the church leaders knew of the Holocaust by the end of 1942 , knowing more than any other church leaders outside the Vatican . However , after the war , some bishops , including Adolf Bertram and Conrad Grober claimed that they were not aware of the extent and details of the Holocaust , and were not certain of the information they did possess . # Public statements # Bishops von Preysing and Frings were the most public in the statements against genocide . According to Phayer , no other German bishops spoke as pointedly as Preysing and Frings . # Fulda meetings # The bishops met annually during the war in Fulda . The issue of whether the bishops should speak out against the persecution of the Jews was debated at a 1942 meeting in Fulda . The consensus was to give up heroic action in favor of small successes . A draft letter proposed by Margarete Sommer was rejected , because it was viewed as a violation of the ' ' Reichskonkordat ' ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1943 , bishop Grober expressed the opinion that the bishop should remain loyal to the beloved folk and Fatherland , despite abuses of the ' ' Reichskonkordat ' ' . # Defence of Jews # What protests the German bishops did make regarding anti-Jewish policies , tended to be by way of private letters to government ministers . The papal letter condemned racial theories and the mistreatment of people based on race . According to Gill , Hitler was beside himself with rage . Twelve presses were seized , and hundreds of people sent either to prison or the camps . This despite Article 4 of the reichskonkordat guaranteeing freedom of correspondence between the Vatican and the German clergy , Later , in Pius XII 's first encyclical , Summi Pontificatus , which came only a month into the war , the Church reiterated the Catholic stance against racism and anti-semitism : there is neither Gentile nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , barbarian nor Scythian , bond nor free . But Christ is all and in all and endorsed resistance against those opposed to the ethical content of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses ) and the Sermon on the Mount given by Jesus . When the newly installed Nazi Government began to instigate its program of anti-semitism , Pope Pius XI , through his Secretary of State Cardinal Pacelli , ordered the Papal Nuncio in Berlin , Cesare Orsenigo , to look into whether and how it may be possible to become involved in their aid . Orsenigo proved a poor instrument in this regard , concerned more with the anti-church policies of the Nazis and how these might effect German Catholics , than with taking action to help German Jews . Cardinal Innitzer called him timid and ineffectual with respect to the worsening situation for German Jewry . Nazi racial ideology held that Jews were subhuman and posited that Christ had been an Aryan . Ludwig Muller was Hitler 's choice for Reich Bishop of the German Evangelical Church , which sought to subordinate German Protestantism to the Nazi Government . But Muller 's heretical views against St Paul and the Semitic origins of Christ and the Bible quickly alienated sections of the Protestant church , leading to the foundation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity also alarmed Catholics . Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber responded with three Advent sermons in 1933 , entitled ' ' Judaism , Christianity , and Germany ' ' , He affirmed the Jewish origins of the Christian religion , the continuity of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible , and the importance of the Christian tradition to Germany . In 1943 , the German bishops debated whether to directly confront Hitler collectively over what they knew of the murdering of Jews , but decided not to take this course . Some bishops did speak out individually however - Von Preysing of Berlin spoke of a right of all people to life , Joseph Frings of Cologne wrote a pastoral letter cautioning his diocese not , even in wartime , to violate the inherent rights of others to life , even those not of our blood and preached in a sermon that no one may take the property or life of an innocent person just because he is a member of a foreign race . # Historical evaluation # # Praise # Some German bishops are praised for their wartime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Heinrich Wienken ( a post-war bishop ) very likely personally hid Jews in Berlin during the war . Clemens August Graf von Galen was a well-known public opponent of the Nazi euthanasia program , if not the Holocaust itself . # Criticism # Phayer believes that the German episcopate -- as opposed to other bishops -- could have done more to save Jews . According to Phayer , had the German bishops confronted the Holocaust publicly and nationally , the possibilities of undermining Hitler 's death apparatus might have existed . Admittedly , it is speculative to assert this , but it is certain that many more German Catholics would have sought to save Jews by hiding them if their church leaders had spoken out . In this regard , Phayer places the responsibility with the Vatican , asserting that a strong papal assertion would have enabled the bishops to overcome their disinclinations and that Bishop Preysing 's only hope to spur his colleagues into action lay in Pope Pius XII . # Notes #

4 Gibran is a crater on Mercury , which was discovered in January 2008 during the first flyby of the planet by MESSENGER spacecraft . It contains a large ( ) , nearly circular pit crater . Multiple examples of pit craters have been observed on Mercury on the floors of impact craters , leading to the name pit-floor craters for the impact structures that host these features . Unlike impact craters , pit craters are rimless , often irregularly shaped , steep-sided , and often display no associated ejecta or lava flows . These pit craters are thought to be evidence of shallow volcanic activity and may have formed when retreating magma caused an unsupported area of the surface to collapse , creating a pit . They are analogs of Earth 's volcanic calderas . Pit-floor craters may provide an indication of internal igneous processes where other evidence of volcanic processes is absent or ambiguous . The discovery of multiple pit-floor craters augments evidence that volcanic activity has been a widespread process in the geologic evolution of Mercury 's crust .

514 ' ' Good Hair ' ' is a 2009 American comedy documentary film produced by Chris Rock Productions and HBO Films , starring and narrated by comedian Chris Rock . Premiering at the Sundance Film Festival on January 18 , 2009 , ' ' Good Hair ' ' was released to select theaters in the United States by Roadside Attractions on October 9 , 2009 , opening across the country on October 23 . The film focuses on the issue of how African-American women have perceived their hair and historically styled it . The film explores the current styling industry for black women , images of what is considered acceptable and desirable for African-American women 's hair in the United States , and their relation to African American culture . # Overview # According to Rock , he was inspired to make the movie after his 3-year-old daughter Lola asked him , Daddy , how come I do n't have good hair ? She has curly , wiry hair typical of many people of African descent . He realized she had already absorbed the perception among some blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $9 billion black hair industry , and visits such places as beauty salons , barbershops , and hair styling conventions to explore popular approaches to styling . He visits scientific laboratories to learn the science behind chemical relaxers that straighten hair . Rock intended to explore the topic seriously , but with humor . The movie features interviews from hair care industry businesspeople , stylists ( Derek J , Jason Griggers and others ) and their customers , and celebrities such as Ice-T , Nia Long , Paul Mooney , T-Pain , Raven-Symon , Maya Angelou , KRS-One , Salt-n-Pepa , Kerry Washington , Eve , Reverend Al Sharpton , Andre Harrell , Tracie Thoms , Lauren London , and Meagan Good . These public figures discuss their experiences with their own hair , and the issue of how different types and characteristics of black hair are perceived in the black community . # Themes # Rock explores why black women adopt so many different styles for their hair . Techniques designed to straighten hair appear to be intended to give it characteristics of European ( or white ) hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recent innovations in fashion . Rock is quoted as saying , I knew women wanted to be beautiful , but I did nt know the lengths they would go to , the time they would spend and not complain about it . In fact , they appear to look forward to it. # Interviews with public figures # The film features interviews with prominent entertainers and other public figures , including Nia Long , Ice-T , Raven-Symon , Maya Angelou , Salt-n-Pepa , Eve , Tracie Thoms , and Reverend Al Sharpton . They provide opinions on good hair and recount personal experiences in dealing with their hair . Nia Long says , Theres always this sort of pressure within the black community like , if you have good hair , youre prettier or better than the brown-skinned girl that wears the Afro or the dreads or the natural hairstyle . In Jeannette Catsoulis ' review of the film , she notes that Rock questions why African-American women adopt a concept of beauty that is not based on the natural characteristics of their hair . Some endure sometimes-painful hair treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatments , such as hair relaxers , are done improperly , they can cause hair loss or burns on the scalp . ( Similarly and paradoxically , many ethnic European or Asian women with straight hair get permanents to curl their hair , and are at risk for similar burns and hair damage . Fashion has always involved manipulation of image , whether body , face or hair . ) Al Sharpton says , We wear our economic oppression on our heads . He refers to the hair business , which yields billions of dollars in revenues , has shifted from African-American manufacturers to Asian manufacturers . Although the products are targeted to black consumers , Asians are making the profits . To gain insights into the cultural issue , Rock also interviewed students and faculty at Santa Monica High School , customers in hair salons and barbershops , and hair dealers . He visited Dudley Products , one of the few companies owned by African Americans that makes hair products for the African-American community . # Reception # The film met with positive reviews from critics . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating on aggregate review website Rotten Tomatoes based on 78 reviews , with an average score of 7.4/10 . Another review aggregation website , Metacritic , based on 100 reviews from mainstream critics , gave the film an average score of 72/100 based on 27 reviews . It received the Special Jury Prize Documentary at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival .

The film expanded to 466 theaters on October 23. # Criticism # The documentary was criticized for not taking into account how the politics of African-American women 's hair is involved in racism , sexism and classism . Moreover , the diversity of African-American hair is not recognized as well as individual agency is changing one 's hair . Alynda Wheat of Entertainment Weekly shares how African-American women are not not anthropological subjects , and we do nt like being treated as curiosities . Many critics also note that African-American women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his review , Roger Ebert states Few people of any race wear completely natural hair . If they did , we would be a nation of Unibombers . Rock responded to critics on the Oprah Winfrey Show , saying it 's not important what 's on top of your headit 's important what 's inside of your head . That is the theme of the movie . # Recognition and honors # The film received the Special Jury Prize for a Documentary at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival .

514 LIFT Productions ( an acronym for Louisiana Institute of Film Technology ) was the first concerted private sector effort to combat Runaway production of film and television from the United States . In the 1990s the U.S. market lost over 100,000 production-related jobs , as motion picture and television programming increasingly became manufactured offshore . The outflow of work was in large part due to lucrative incentives offered by Canada , its provinces , and European Union members . In 2002 , at the urging of LIFT founders Malcolm Petal and John J Anderson , Louisiana passed a first-in-the-nation incentive program to compete directly with Canada . LIFT quickly leveraged those incentives to become one of the largest global manufacturers of made-for-television movies , low-budget feature films , music videos , and commercials . During its first five years of operation , LIFT was responsible for well over a billion dollars in production . By 2007 LIFT had spread throughout the State of Louisiana , as well as opening satellite Production Houses in Arizona and Connecticut . It had also broken ground on a $200,000,000 production complex in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau of Investigation agents raided LIFT 's offices , making sweeping accusations of fraud , money laundering , and tax evasion , valued at tens of millions of dollars . Despite the sensational allegations , the investigation petered out , officially closing in 2009 without uncovering any crimes , fraud or abuse at LIFT . CEO and Founder Malcolm Petal pled guilty in an unrelated bribery case . By that time , though , LIFT was a defunct organization . Its creditors continue to sue the State of Louisiana which refuses to honor tax incentives promised to LIFT , despite the fact that LIFT was cleared of any wrongdoing . # Early days # LIFT was a Production House formed by New Orleans attorney Malcolm Petal , and Producer John J Anderson . Their stated goal was to create a production infrastructure in Louisiana to compete with Los Angeles and New York . Throughout 2001 and 2002 the founders lobbied the Louisiana legislature to pass a production incentive modeled after Canada 's . The duo testified that Louisiana could become immediately competitive with much larger markets by recruiting U.S.-based productions back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive packages proposed by the LIFT founders on June 1 , 2002 . That same month LIFT officially opened its doors . During its early days LIFT concentrated primarily on music videos and commercials . Through its partnership with HSI Productions of California , LIFT produced a continuous stream of videos for a wide array of artists , including Mariah Carey , Jessica Simpson and LeAnn Rimes , as well as several national ad campaigns , including memorable spots for Lincoln and Payless Shoes . The tax credit program was widely recognized and hailed for its generosity - applying to music videos and commercials , as well as films and television , and also because there was no ceiling on how much credit can be accrued per production or per year . Three separate sets of production initiatives - a sales tax exemption , a labor tax credit encouraging productions to hire Louisiana labor and an investor tax credit that offered credit on as much as 15% on overall production costs . Petal explained that Without an incentive program it 's almost impossible to finance independent films and television movies .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle , back to the United States , this Louisiana incentive . n # Expanding business # LIFT had initially made low-budget feature films for limited theatrical release , like the cult classics Evil Remains and Freshman Orientation . However , in 2004 it expanded aggressively into the movie-of-the-week market producing dozens of films for Lifetime , CBS , and A&amp;E , including Christopher Reeve 's last picture , The Brooke Ellison Story , and the critically acclaimed mini-series Elvis , which earned Emmy nominations for the LIFT Founders . By the end of 2004 , LIFT had over 500 employees on payroll and had entered into long-term production and distribution contracts with independent powerhouse Lions ' Gate Entertainment . The partnership gained immediate box-office success with major releases , such as the comedy-classic Waiting .. , and critical acclaim with art-house offerings such as Bug starring Ashley Judd , which earned legendary director Billy Friedkin the coveted Director 's Award at the Cannes Film Festival . That year , LIFT had produced almost $75,000,000 in locally-financed production and was on track to double that in 2005 with more than 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its distribution outlets , releasing Mr. Brooks , starring Kevin Kostner , through MGM , and Factory Girl , starring Sienna Miller through the Weinstein Company . While in 2001 , movie production in Louisiana had an impact of just $30 million , by 2003 , estimates were in excess of $100 million . According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the motion picture industry in Louisiana grew by 22% per year between 2001 and 2007 with wages increasing 8.2% per year during that same period . A report released by the Economic Research Associates for Louisiana Department of Economic Development in 2007 found that the industry supported 6,230 jobs in Louisiana ( 3,310 directly and 2,920 indirectly ) , generated $203.7 million , and an average income of $32,700 per job . The ... $429.2 million of direct in-state spending for 2007 amounted to $763 million of economic benefit to Louisiana , when things like rents , royalties , profits , dividends , property taxes and various indirect benefits are factored in . Wages within the states motion picture increased 8.2 per percent per year between 2001 and 2007 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact of the motion picture industry on the states economy , the report noted that $429.2 million of direct in-state spending for 2007 ultimately amounted to $763 million of economic benefit to Louisiana , when things like rents , royalties , profits , dividends , property taxes and various indirect benefits are factored in. # Hurricane Katrina # LIFT had nine productions either actively shooting , or preparing to , in and around the New Orleans area in August 2005 ( including The Last Time , starring Brendan Fraser and Michael Keaton ) . Budgets for these totalled over $100 million . Housing , production crews , and new set locations were all in place about a week after the hurricane hit . When Hurricane Katrina hit , most movie studios abandoned Louisiana , citing the poor infrastructure , dangerous weather , and inability to find insurance . However , LIFT managed to relocate all its Louisiana productions in other parts of the State , including opening a major production center in Shreveport in the far North of the State . L.I.F.T . offered all of its Louisiana workers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stipends to establish an expansion office in North Louisiana ( $1.5 million aid package ) . .. All 500 workers on L.I.F.T.s payroll continue to receive paychecks without interruption despite closed banks and strained communications . As Petal stated at LIFT 's opening of its Shreveport facility , Louisiana 's incentive program has given it the opportunity to be the hub of the international Production industry in the 21st Century , but that only can take place if it is a statewide effort . Having an anchor for the industry , along the Northern I-20 corridor in Shreveport , is a crucial step in that journey . Today Shreveport is one of the most active Production locales in the United States . Thus , Katrina proved to be a significant growth opportunity for LIFT , which survived the disruption through a massive ground effort to move workers and equipment throughout the State . All of LIFTs productions were up and running again in less than a week , while most of the State was still shut down and reeling from the subsequent blast of Hurricane Rita . LIFT also kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their families a generous relief package , which included 8 months or more of free housing and benefits , whether they worked on a LIFT Production or not . Subsequently , LIFT was the first production company to return to New Orleans after the storm , shooting Pride , starring Terrence Howard , in the Spring of 2006 . LIFT was successfully promoting Louisiana 's new nickname Hollywood South . It produced more than 30 films and TV shows , adding $250 million in much-needed revenues to a disaster-ravaged state . The industry as a whole had brought $400 million in film investments to Louisiana . MovieMaker Magazine ranked the State 4th in filmmaking in 2005 . Mayor Nagin also introduced significant initiatives moving New Orleans to the next level of the Trinity Industry with film , music , and video game production , and created a National Film Advisory Board to assist in making New Orleans a top of the line place to film movies Prospects and hopes remained high . Petal saw film production as a great way to keep skilled labor in Louisiana . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenters and electricians and hairdressers . And every business in town gets used . The dry cleaners and the hotels and the car rental services . So the money gets out of the community fast . It 's non-polluting , unlike a lot of other businesses that we could attract down here . At that time LIFT was employing up to 500 people at wages starting at $20/hour. # The Film Factory # The Friday before Hurricane Katrina hit , LIFT purchased 18 acre of land in downtown New Orleans , west of the French Quarter ( intersection of St. Louis &amp; Galvez Streets ) to build a $200,000,000 , state-of-the-art production complex . The 320000sqft m2 Film Factory was to be built to withstand extreme weather events and to international standards for essential facilities . The plans included : Seven Class A sound stages ( two devoted to film school productions ) , movie and television production support spaces , production offices , central wardrobe and props , a full service film and media education center . It was also designed to house two digital media incubator labs , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the development of animation productions . It was to be the first facility in the United States to house a state-of-the-art training institute on an active motion picture studio lot . Within five years the school would have been training 750 residents a year for careers in the Louisiana production market . Film Factory was not just a building , but a massive attempt to build the first Hollywood studio outside of Hollywood , in the history of motion pictures . It included major strategic partnerships , like one with Lions ' Gate which had agreed to move many of its core operations to Louisiana and house them at the Film Factory , as well as top vendors and suppliers , such as Panavision and Kodak . According to third-party studies 1,200 motion picture production jobs were projected in Louisiana in 2009-10 . The Film Factory was to create 5,000 jobs in its first year , and 20,000 jobs by the time it reached its peak of operations . Located in the Treme area abutting downtown New Orleansthe poorest census tract in the countrythe Film Factory was an ambitious effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Similarly a Tulane study estimated that when the production studio and film institute came online in 2008 it would create nearly 2,253 direct and 1,517 indirect jobs and adding $131 million in payroll . On October 19 , 2006 Film Factory officially broke ground , with a golden shovel ceremony officiated by Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco , New Orleans Mayor C. Ray Nagin , and his political opponent Lieutenant Governor , Mitch Landrieu . Completion was scheduled for the last quarter of 2008 . The vertically-integrated business boasted a $180,000,000 development deal with Element Films ( the movie division of billionaire club impresario Sam Nazarian 's SBE Entertainment empire ) and a $50,000,000 revolving line of credit with Merrill-Lynch to distribute films through Lions Gate and MGM . If successful , the Film Factory would have transformed LIFT into a major studio , and catapulted New Orleans ' economic standing well past its regional competitors , putting it on an economic footing with New York , Los Angeles , and Chicago . Within 5 years the developments 12-month vocational school was to train 750 local residents per year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpenters to hairdressers ; from electricians to graphic artists ; from visual artists to caterers , there is a career in the Film industry for every ambition and natural talent , announced CEO Petal at the Film Factory ground-breaking . And what 's more these are union jobs , with pension and health benefits , and starting salaries from $20 to $45 per hour . These are careers that will allow the people of Treme to build dignified lives on single salaries , own homes , pay for college . The City 's Executive Director of Arts and Entertainment , Ernest Collins , and Rep. Steve Scalise R-Jefferson expressed the importance of this infrastructure development to the sustainability of the film industry in Louisiana . Petal stated at the time We 've brought a lot of the industry here with cash . The trick is to not have that be the sole reason people come here . We have to try to leverage the tax incentives to build a more well-rounded industry .. This will show people that they can build a career here . People have to feel that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raid # On June 1 , 2007 FBI and IRS agents raided LIFT 's offices . Unnamed Federal sources and news reports indicated that the U.S. Attorney 's office believed LIFT had been involved in massive fraud . Some estimates topped $100,000,000 . The underwriters of the Film Factory soon withdrew . LIFT tried to maintain its business , but the Louisiana Department of Economic Development banned all LIFT-related productions in the midst of all the publicity , drying up all of its development and distribution deals . The multi-agency U.S. Department of Justice investigation lasted over five years and cast a wide net , serving grand jury subpoeanas on major Hollywood studios , law firms , brokerages , and CPAs . FBI and IRS agents from New York , Ohio , Texas and California expended thousands of manhours , including multiple interviews of Kevin Kostner ( the star of the LIFT release , Mr. Brooks ) . Despite its wide scope , the investigation failed to turn up any evidence of fraud or abuse of tax credits , as United States Attorney James B. Letten had proclaimed at the outset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pled guilty to paying a bribe to Mark Smith , the Louisiana Film Commissioner , in a matter unrelated to LIFT . He admitted receiving a $135,000 fee from LIFT CEO Malcolm Petal to help convince the State of Louisiana to allow popular music festivals like JazzFest , Essence , and Voodoo to utilize the film tax credits for their productions . Petal feared that without government assistance , New Orleans would lose these festivals in the wake of Hurricane Katrina . Bradley admitted he paid $65,000 of that fee to Smith , but that Petal had no direct knowledge of the payment . Petal pled guilty to conspiracy to bribe in the matter . and is received the maximum 5-year sentence . During his sentencing proceedings the United States ' Attorney 's office admitted they had not proved any actual harm caused by the bribe , any gain to Petal , or that Petal had any knowledge that Bradley hade made payments to Smith . Nevertheless , Eastern District of Louisiana Judge Lance Africk , a personal friend of United States Attorney Letten , sentenced Petal to the maximum 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know of the bribe itself to be guilty of conspiracy to bribe , because in a conspiracy the right hand does not need to know what the left hand is doing . He opined that the maximum sentence was warranted due to the seriousness of the offense and that Petal had lost his moral compass . # Conclusion # On January 5 , 2014 , after seven years of litigation by the State of Louisiana , claiming LIFT and Petal had committed fraud , a final judgment was issued stating tersely that the State of Louisiana would like LIFT 's actions to be considered a fraud perpetrated by an unscrupulous businessman Petal . The evidence presented does not support this conclusion . LIFT v. LED , American Arbitration Association Case No.691400023208 ( 2014 ) . LIFT 's meteoric rise and fall left many unanswered questions . During the post-hurricane recovery New Orleans was suffering in a continuing maelstrom with LIFTs Film Factory the most ambitious of the many failed attempts to make us of Gulf Opportunity Zone bonds for recovery. 35 The results of the investigation and its impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney Jim Letten . While popular amongst white conservatives as a crime fighter , he is widely regarded as a publicity hound amongst liberals , and a racist in the black community . His aggressive , yet fruitless , pursuit of LIFT which included several press conferences and the highly publicized raid , killed an unprecedented industrial revitalization project that would have brought tens of thousands of jobs to an area of entrenched poverty ( and almost exclusively African-American ) . Letten 's pro-White political leanings , and the fact that his investigation uncovered none of the promised fraud , bribery , or abuse at LIFT , led many to suspect his underlying motive was not to uncover corruption , but to arrest the development of the Film Factory , which might have shifted New Orleans balance-of-power inexorably to its Black population . This occurred at a time when some New Orleans whites felt for the first time they had an opportunity to stop the progress of black power ( due to the destruction of black-owned property in Hurricane Katrina ) . The Film Factory represented an opportunity for African-Americans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to service-industry ) salaries . Suspicion of Letten is greatly enhanced by the Company he keeps . His best friends include United States Senator David Vitter and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales . Letten notably gave Vitter a pass on a Mann Act violation for utilizing hookers in New Orleans and D.C. # TODAY # As a result of LIFT 's successful efforts to compete with international incentives , Louisiana is now the second largest production state behind California , and 39 other States have passed film incentives in the last decade . However , LIFT 's vision of utilizing the credits as a lever for broad economic development has not been adopted by any other actors , and the programs remain large give-aways to film studios , justified mainly for the public relations value of attracting film and television to one 's community . # Filmography # ; Films * ' ' Bug ' ' * ' ' The Last Time ' ' * ' ' Mr. Brooks ' ' * ' ' Premonition ' ' * ' ' Pride ' ' * ' ' Factory Girl ' ' * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ...

4 ( EUROCAT Q33.80 ) ICD9 = ICDO = OMIM = MedlinePlus = eMedicineSubj = ped eMedicineTopic = 534 eMedicinemult = MeshID = D015615 Congenital pulmonary airway malformation ( CPAM ) , formerly known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation ( CCAM ) , is a congenital disorder of the lung similar to bronchopulmonary sequestration . In CPAM , usually an entire lobe of lung is replaced by a non-working cystic piece of abnormal lung tissue . This abnormal tissue will never function as normal lung tissue . The underlying cause for CPAM is unknown . It occurs in approximately 1 in every 30,000 pregnancies . In most cases the outcome of a fetus with CPAM is very good . In rare cases , the cystic mass grows so large as to limit the growth of the surrounding lung and cause pressure against the heart . In these situations , the CPAM can be life-threatening for the fetus . CPAM can be separated into five types , based on clinical and pathologic features . CPAM type 1 is the most common , with large cysts and a good prognosis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor prognosis , owing to its frequent association with other significant anomalies . Other types are rare . # Diagnosis # CPAMs are often identified during routine prenatal ultrasonography . Identifying characteristics on the sonogram include : an echogenic ( bright ) mass appearing in the chest of the fetus , displacement of the heart from its normal position , a flat or everted ( pushed downward ) diaphragm , or the absence of visible lung tissue . CPAMs are classified into three different types based largely on their gross appearance . Type I has a large ( 2 cm ) multiloculated cysts . Type II has smaller uniform cysts . Type III is not grossly cystic , referred to as the adenomatoid type . Microscopically , the lesions are not true cysts , but communicate with the surrounding parenchyma . Some lesions have an abnormal connection to a blood vessel from an aorta and are referred to as hybrid lesions. # Treatment # In most cases , a fetus with CPAM is closely monitored during pregnancy and the CPAM is removed via surgery after birth . Most babies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first few months . Many patients have surgery , typically before their first birthday , because of the risk of recurrent lung infections associated with CPAMs . Some pediatric surgeons can safely remove these lesions using very tiny incisions with the aid of a telescope ( thoracoscopy ) . However , some CPAM patients live a full life without any complication or incident . It is hypothesized that there are thousands of people living with an undetected CPAM . Through ultrasound testing employed in recent years , many more patients are aware that they live with this condition . Rarely , long standing CPAMs have been reported to become cancerous . Very large cystic masses might pose a danger during birth because of the airway compression . In this situation , a special surgical type of delivery called the EXIT procedure may be used . In rare extreme cases , where fetus 's heart is in danger , fetal surgery can be performed to remove the CPAM . If non-immune hydrops fetalis develop , there is a near universal mortality of the fetus without intervention . Fetal surgery can improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies found that a single course of prenatal steroids ( betamethasone ) may increase survival in hydropic fetuses with microcystic CPAMs to 75-100% . These studies indicate that large microcystic lesions may be treated prenatally without surgical intervention . Large macrocyst lesions may require in utero placement of a Harrison thoracoamniotic shunt . # Popular culture # In season 3 of the television show ' ' House ' ' , episode 17 ( Fetal Position ) features a pregnant woman whose fetus is ultimately diagnosed with CPAM . In the climax of the episode , the team performs open fetal surgery to remove the cysts.

4 placeofburial=Narooma , New South Wales Pearl Elizabeth Corkhill MM ( 11 March 1887 &amp;ndash ; 4 December 1985 ) was an Australian military nurse of the First World War . Trained as a nurse in Sydney , Corkhill enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 4 June 1915 . After serving in France at the 1st and 3rd Australian General Hospitals , Corkhill was assigned to the 38th British Casualty Clearing Station near Abbeville on 21 August 1918 . On 23 August , while the camp was being heavily bombed by enemy aircraft , Corkhill remained calm and continued to tend to her patients , despite the danger . For her bravery , she was awarded the Military Medal , one of only seven Australian nurses to be so decorated in the First World War . Following the Armistice , she went on to work as a nurse at various public hospitals , and donated a large collection of her father 's photographs to the National Library of Australia . # Early life # Corkill was born on 11 March 1887 , the second child of William Corkhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bate . Growing up on the family ranch , Marengo , near Tilba Tilba in southern New South Wales , Corkhill and her sister Edith 's lives where extensively recorded by their father , who by 1890 had become a professional photographer .

She undertook nursing training at a private hospital in Summer Hill , Sydney and qualified as a general nurse in 1914. # Military years # On 4 June 1915 , Corkhill enrolled as a staff nurse in the Australian Imperial Force . She left Fremantle aboard the A62 ' ' Wandila ' ' on 25 June 1915 , and arrived in Egypt in July that year . She was assigned to the 1st Australian General Hospital , and assisted in the treatment of soldiers involved with the Gallipoli Campaign .

In her time at the British hospital , Corkhill looked forward to returning to an Australian hospital and being amongst our boys ; the Australian soldiers often found their compatriots to be friendlier than the British nurses . On Anzac Day 1916 , a year after the Landing at Gallipoli , Corkhill and two other Australian nurses commemorated the occasion . They wore gum tree leaves on their capes , and gave small packets of cigarettes and matches to the Australians who were interned at the hospital as gifts . Corkhill went back to serve at the 1st Australian General Hospital in Rouen on 16 June 1916 for the remainder of the year . On 23 January 1917 , she went to England on leave until 9 February .

After serving in with the 3rd Australian General Hospital for a further two months , she was again posted to the Casualty Clearing Station on 21 August 1918. # Military Medal # Casualty Clearing Stations were deliberately sited as close to the front line as possible , since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than the time to travel to a field hospital allowed . Often within seven miles of the front line , they were considered extremely dangerous , and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military . As a result of its proximity to the front , the station would often come under enemy attack , as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August .

Her example was of the greatest value in allaying the alarm of the patients . Corkhill was initially unconvinced that she deserved the award , being more concerned about having to purchase a new dress to wear while meeting the King . The award was more heavily celebrated by the men than by Corkhill herself , as she described in a letter to her mother : # Later service # The day following the action , 24 August , Corkhill was posted to the 1st Australian General Hospital , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained for service at the 1st Australian Auxiliary Hospital in Harefield , London on 27 August 1918 .

She was discharged on 22 June 1919. # Later life # A memorial commemorating Corkhill 's efforts in the war was erected in Tilba , and she was presented with the medal by Governor-General Lord Foster . Following the war , Corkhill went on to pursue a nursing career . After serving as a nurse in various hospitals both in Australia and overseas , Corkhill became the senior sister at the District Hospital in Bega , New South Wales in 1951 . In 1975 , she donated a large collection of her father 's photographs to National Library of Australia .

4 Aristotle 's views on women influenced later Western thinkers , who quoted him as an authority until the end of the Middle Ages , and are thus an important topic in women 's history . He saw women subject to men , but higher than slaves . In Chapter 12 of his Politics he writes , The slave is wholly lacking the deliberative element ; the female has it but it lacks authority ; the child has it but it is incomplete ( 1260a11 ) # Differences between male and female # Aristotle believed that nature ordained not only physical differences between male and female but mental differences as well . By comparison to man , he argued , woman is more mischievous , less simple , more impulsive .. more compassionate , .. more easily moved to tears , .. more jealous , more querulous , more apt to scold and to strike , .. more prone to despondency and less hopeful , .. more void of shame or self-respect , more false of speech , more deceptive , of more retentive memory and .. also more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action ( History of Animals , 608b. 1-14 ) . Moreover , in accord with his society 's custom of allowing girls and women to eat only half as much as boys and men , he added that woman requires a smaller quantity of nutriment ( History of Animals , 608b. 14 ) Aristotle wrote extensively on his views of the nature of semen . His views on how a child 's sex is decided have since been abandoned . He wrote that only fair-skinned women , not darker-skinned women , had a sexual discharge and climaxed . He also believed this discharge could be increased by eating of pungent foods . Aristotle thought a woman 's sexual discharge was akin to that of an infertile or amputated male 's . He concluded that both sexes contributed to the material of generation , but that the female 's contribution was in her discharge ( as in a male 's ) rather than within the ovary . His idea of procreation was an active , ensouling masculine element bringing life to a passive female element . Aristotle explains how and why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by commenting on male rule over barbarians , or non-Greeks . By nature the female has been distinguished from the slave . For nature makes nothing in the manner that the coppersmiths make the Delphic knife-that is , frugally- but , rather , it makes each thing for one purpose . For each thing would do its work most nobly if it had one task rather than many . Among the barbarians the female and the slave have the same status . This is because there are no natural rulers among them but , rather , the association among them is between male and female slave . On account of this , the poets say that it is fitting that Greeks rule barbarians , as the barbarian and the slave are by nature the same . While Aristotle reduced women 's roles in society , and promoted the idea that women should receive less food and nourishment than males , he also criticised the results : a woman , he thought , was then more compassionate , more opinionated , more apt to scold and to strike . He stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame or self-respect , more false of speech , more deceptive , and of having a better memory . # Modes of Rule # Aristotle supported the laws that meant a woman 's personal wealth automatically became her husband 's . According to Aristotle , there were different ways or modes ( ' ' tropoi ' ' ) of rule , including despotic , royal , and political rule . Political rule is of those who are free and equal , who tend in their nature to be on equal terms and to differ in nothing . And Aristotle thought that a husband and wife should live under political rule , the rule suitable to those who are free and equal . Aristotle nevertheless thought that women should not leave the female quarters of the house , and by his death the health of women in Athens had deteriorated , and they were living on average 10 years less than males with elevated rates of death through child-birth . As for the differences between husband and wife , Aristotle says that these always consisted in external appearances , in speeches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband lose money and his reputation , a wife was to refrain from complaint and to attribute this to sickness , ignorance or accidental errors . He thought that , sometimes but not always , males were leaders , or , both the male and the female have the deliberative capacity of the soul , but he thought that in the female it lacked authority . # On a Good Wife , from ' ' Oikonomikos ' ' , c. 330 BCE # Therefore it befits not a man of sound mind to bestow his person promiscuously , or have random intercourse with women ; for otherwise the base-born will share in the rights of his lawful children , and his wife will be robbed of her honor due , and shame be attached to his sons.And it is fitting that he should approach his wife in honor , full of self-restraint and awe ; and in his conversation with her , should use only the words of a right-minded man , suggesting only such acts as are themselves lawful and honorable . Aristotle 's thought that a wife was best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and that he had no preference for another woman ; but before all others loves , trusts her and holds her as his own . Aristotle wrote that a husband should secure the agreement , loyalty , and devotion of his wife , so that whether he himself is present or not , there may be no difference in her attitude towards him , since she realizes that they are alike guardians of the common interests ; and so when he is away she may feel that to her no man is kinder or more virtuous or more truly hers than her own husband . # Spartan women # Aristotle wrote that in Sparta , the legislator wanted to make the whole city ( or country ) hardy and temperate , and that he carried out his intention in the case of the men , but he overlooked the women , who lived in every sort of intemperance and wealth . He added that in those regimes in which the condition of the women was bad , half the city could be regarded as having no laws . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal weight to women 's happiness as he did to men 's , and commented in his ' ' Rhetoric ' ' that a society can not be happy unless women are happy too . In an article titled ' ' Aristotle 's Account of the subjection of Women ' ' Stauffer explains that Aristotle believed that in nature a common good came of the rule of a superior being . But he does n't indicate a common good for men being superior to women . He uses the word ' Kreitton ' to indicate superiority , meaning stronger . Aristotle believed that rational reasoning is what made you superior over lesser beings in nature , yet still used the term meaning stronger , not more rational or intelligent . Would this then imply that men simply gained their superiority over women by being stronger ? # Children # On children , he said , And what could be more divine than this , or more desired by a man of sound mind , than to beget by a noble and honored wife children who shall be the most loyal supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the preservers of the whole house ? Rightly reared by father and mother , children will grow up virtuous , as those who have treated them piously and righteously deserve that they should . Aristotle believed we all have a biological drive to procreate , to leave behind something to take the place and be similar to ourselves . This then justifies the natural partnership between man and woman . And each person has one specific purpose because we are better at mastering one specific trait rather than being adequate at multiple . Women 's purpose , it seems he believes , is to birth children . Aristotle stressed that man and woman work together to raise the children and that how they raise them has a huge influence over the kind of people they become and thus the kind of society or community that everyone lives in. # Legacy # # Galen # Aristotle 's assumptions on female coldness influenced Galen and others for almost two thousand years until the sixteenth century . # Church Fathers # Joyce E. Salisbury argues that the Church Fathers , influenced by Aristotle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it threatened to emancipate women from men . # Otto Weininger # In his ' ' Sex and Character ' ' , written in 1903 , Otto Weininger explained that all people are composed of a mixture of the male and the female substance , and that these views are supported scientifically .

4 The Hopewell Museum is in Hopewell , Mercer County , New Jersey . # History # The museum was incorporated in 1922 as the ' ' Hopewell Free Public Library and Museum Funding and Building Association ' ' . It was formed to raise funds for a building to house a collection of antiques donated by Sarah D. Stout . This collection became the cornerstone of the museum . Many of the items having been used by the early inhabitants of Hopewell . The original Museum and Hopewell Public Library were housed in a three-storey brownstone that was built by Randolph Stout in 1877 . In 1965 the Hopewell Public Library moved to its present location and in 1967 a two-story addition was made to the Museum building . The additional space enabled the Hopewell Museum to display other collections of Southwestern Native American crafts donated by Dr. David H. Hill .

4514 Ogging is term for a tactic developed for the online multiplayer game ' ' Netrek ' ' . This game was among the very first multiplayer Internet based games , and was most popular in the 1990s on university Unix systems used for internet access , and is still played today , having been later adapted to Windows and Macintosh computers . The ogg is a kamikaze-style attack , frequently coordinated between multiple ships , with the goal of eliminating a target of high importance , generally with the idea that destroying the target is strategically more valuable than the survival of the attacking ships . It was typically used to destroy enemy ships carrying armies or as a coordinated multi-ship ogg against a starbase . According to the Jargon File , ogg was sometimes also used by extension in the context of other games or in real life . # Fake ogging # Often a player would cloak and make ogging-like movements if injured or in order to buy time until reinforcements arrived ; this was known as fake ogging . Fake ogging could also convince a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a diversion for a carrier to capture a planet or achieve some other team objective . # History # In the game , players are designated by two alphanumeric characters , where the first character represents the team and the second letter represents the individual designation of that player . There are four teams , Federation , Klingon , Romulan , and Orion , identified as F , K , R , and O , and 16 player slots , numbered 0-9 and then a-f ( hexadecimal numbering ) . Thus , for example , a player on the Federation team in the 11th of the 16 player slots would be designated Fb ( FED or Federation team , player B ) , or a player in the first slot who was playing on the Romulan team would be R0 ( ROM or Romulan team , player 0 ) . There were four reserved slots that could only be used by local administrators , identified with g-j ( these have since been reallocated for use by observers who wish to watch the game ) . While the game has four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the unused teams ' planets being used as part of the playing field . During a full game on a Netrek server at CMU during the 1990-91 school year , a member of the Federation team , Stephen Russell ( callsign Feakhelek ) , was heading into Romulan space to capture a planet . The server administrator , Terence Chang , came in on the first reserved slot on the otherwise-empty Orion team , thus being designated as Og . Instead of engaging in a dogfight , Chang charged in suicidally , failing to kill the Federation ship but leaving it badly damaged . When Og re-spawned , and again charged the now-crippled ship , the Fed player shouted to other people in the workstation cluster , Help , it 's oh-gee ! , followed by cries of It 's ogg ! It 's ogg ! Help ! . The second suicide attack worked , prompting the Fed player to broadcast Arrrgh , I was Og'ed on the in-game message system . # References # <references/> *

4 ' ' Goddess of the Market ' ' is a biography of Ayn Rand by historian Jennifer Burns . Subtitled Ayn Rand and the American Right , it explores Rand 's intellectual development and her relationship to the conservative and libertarian movements . The writing of her books and the development of her philosophy of Objectivism are also covered . # Background and publication history # Burns spent eight years working on the book , which began as a dissertation for her doctoral degree from the University of California at Berkeley . In the process of writing the book , Burns became the first independent historian given access to the Ayn Rand Archives , a collection of Rand 's personal papers hosted by the Ayn Rand Institute . When the book was published by Oxford University Press in September 2009 , Burns was an assistant professor of history at the University of Virginia . A paperback edition of the book was released in August 2011. # Contents # The book is divided into four main sections . The first , titled The Education of Ayn Rand , 19051943 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the publication of her novel ' ' The Fountainhead ' ' . The second , From Novelist to Philosopher , 19441957 covers the period in which she wrote her last novel , ' ' Atlas Shrugged ' ' . The third section , Who Is John Galt ? 19571968 , discusses the growth of the Objectivist movement based on Rand 's philosophy , and her relationship and eventual break with her protg Nathaniel Branden . The final section , Legacies , covers the final years of Rand 's life and the continuing reaction to her after her death . Burns also includes an Essay on Sources describing the scholarship about Rand and her own use of the Ayn Rand Archives . # Reception # The book has received generally positive reviews . ' ' Booklist ' ' described it as a thoroughly engaging biography and eminently readable . In a review for ' ' The Washington Times ' ' , libertarian journalist Brian Doherty said that the book provides a proper sense of where Rand really stands in American ideological history . However , he says Burns is less convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing as indicated in the book 's subtitle . A review by Nick Gillespie in ' ' The Wilson Quarterly ' ' said , Burns is particularly sharp at analyzing how Cold War conservatives such as Buckley rejected Rands rationalism but eventually benefited from her popularity with college students during the 1960s . The American Thinker , a conservative website , described Burns as honest about contradictions that plagued Rand and said the book shows the power of Rand 's ideas and the hold she maintained over her followers . A brief review from ' ' Publishers Weekly ' ' was mixed , calling the book exasperatingly detailed and slow-going at times , but complimenting Burns for her ability to explicate the evolution of Rand 's individualist worldview . Several of the reviews compared the book with another biography of Rand , ' ' Ayn Rand and the World She Made ' ' by Anne Heller , which focuses on the details of Rand 's life , in contrast to the intellectual history focused on by Burns . In a review for ' ' The New York Times ' ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same points and touch on many of the same biographical details , although Maslin prefers Heller 's book for its greater detail . The two books were also reviewed jointly in ' ' The New Republic ' ' and ' ' Time ' ' . On October 15 , 2009 , Burns was interviewed about the book on ' ' The Daily Show ' ' . Host Jon Stewart said it was incredible timing for the book to be released at a time when Rand was experiencing a resurgence .. in the culture , a reference to the popularity of Rand 's writing among contemporary conservatives , including the Tea Party movement . 
4 The Democratic Front of Albania ( ) was the largest mass organization of the Party of Labour of Albania ( known from 1941-1948 as the Communist Party of Albania ) which united all other mass organizations of the Party within it , was responsible for carrying out the Party 's cultural and social programs to the masses , and was in charge of nominating candidates in elections . # History # On September 16 , 1942 , the National Liberation Front was established at the initiative of the Communist Party of Albania and with the aim of uniting all Albanians in a national liberation war against the Italian ( and later Nazi German ) occupiers . On November 29 , 1944 the country was liberated , and the NLF began its First Congress on August 5 , 1945 . It elected Enver Hoxha Chairman , renamed itself the Democratic Front , and oriented its work against the manoeuvres of reaction , its organizational consolidation , the activization of the masses in concrete actions , the political mobilization of the whole people to wipe out the remnants of fascism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congresses were held in May 1950 , June 1955 , September 1967 , June 1979 and June 1989 . The Front gained official recognition alongside labor unions , cooperatives , and other mass organizations of the Party of Labour in July 1950 following amendments to the Constitution . Party historiography summed up the early work of the Front as follows : The front was to be the mainstay of the people 's power in its struggle to safeguard freedom and national independence , to reconstruct the country , to achieve its economic , social and cultural development on the road to socialism . The role of the front was the mobilization and political education of the broad masses of the people and the strengthening of the political unity of the Albanian people around the CPA ... The leading force in the front was the working class , to which were now opened wide vistas of increasing in numbers and becoming an industrial working class of a high socialist consciousness .. The laboring peasantry , which had borne the brunt of battle in the National-liberation War , remained the broadest base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party of Labour in 1976 Hoxha referred to the Front as a great political organization which realizes the unity of the Albanian people under the leadership of the Party , has wide scope of action in this field . Continuing , he stated that , In cooperation with the other social organizations , the Front is called upon to carry out all-round work with the urban and rural masses to make the policy , orientations and directives of the Party clear to them , to educate them in the spirit of socialist patriotism , revolutionary vigilance , combat readiness and irreconcilability towards all alien manifestations , to constantly strengthen and temper the unity of the people . The Democratic Front has been and remains a great tribune of the revolutionary opinion of the masses , a powerful lever of the Party to draw the working people into governing the country and solving problems of the socialist construction and the defence of the homeland . Following the death of Hoxha his wife , Nexhmije , served as Chairwoman of the Front from 1986 until being replaced by Adil arani in 1990 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee of the Party of Labour in November 1990 the Front as well as other mass organizations were given the ability to put forward multiple candidates in elections to the People 's Assembly independently of the PLA . In the 1991-1992 period the Front was disbanded . # Functions # The Democratic Front was open to all Albanians aged eighteen and older excepting the former bourgeoisie , kulaks , and other perceived anti-state elements . Albanian author Anton Logoreci writes that , Without a Democratic Front card a person can not obtain work , get a ration book ( when one is required ) , make a purchase at government stores and so on . Its newspaper was titled ' ' Bashkimi ' ' , which with the Party daily ' ' Zri i Popullit ' ' constituted the main political news organs . The Front also had a semiweekly newspaper titled ' ' Laiko Vima ' ' for the Greek minority . In Albania 's first post election held in December 1945 the Front submitted its own list of candidates , winning over 93% of the vote . Hoxha later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval of the masses everywhere , and this fact was so evident that reaction did not even attempt to organize itself and to come out with a list of its own . During the subsequent period in Albanian history no electoral list opposite that of the Front was tolerated . In these elections the Front and the mass organizations united within it nominated members of electoral committees and presented candidates . Unlike other states in Eastern Europe , the Party of Labour 's official ' ' History ' ' noted that there have never been other political parties in the country which has been a very favorable phenomenon for the working class , the people , for the revolution and socialism in Albania . In general practice it was tasked with enlisting the widest possible support for the party 's programme and its revolutionary enterprises .. disseminating the teachings of Marxist-Leninist ideology beyond the narrow circle of the communist lite , it campaigns against political , social and other attitudes regarded as harmful or reactionary by the party leadership . It united all organizations of trade unions , of the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national liberation struggle and of pioneers such as the Trade Unions of Albania , the Union of Albanian Women , the Association of Writers and Artists of Albania , the Labour Youth Union of Albania , and other mass organizations . The Party 's ' ' History ' ' notes that , The PLA has always regarded the unity of the people in the Democratic Front as a unity of classes , strata and people who have no antagonistic contradictions , who are linked by common interests and aims for one or more definite historical stages . In relations among the people the Front sought to expand the practice of criticism ; at the Fourth Congress of the Front Hoxha stated that , The idea that ' there are special people to supervise the activity of government employees ' should be discarded as a erroneous idea which hampers the initiative of the masses and that of the organizations of the Democratic Front to organize and encourage worker supervision ... The organizations of the Front should be more active and combative as rostrums whence the powerful voice of criticism by the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of state organs and of persons employed in them . They should show more courage and severity towards every one who looks down upon and smothers their voice . State problems are the concern of the working people as a whole .. a major role belongs to the organization of the Democratic Front to increase the participation of the masses in the study and solution of major problems of state , to make the masses fully aware of the duty to take active work in running the affairs of the country . Without this we can not speak of enforcing further democratization of the people 's power , of fighting bureaucratism .

4 The mountain stream salamander or mountain stream siredon ( ' ' Ambystoma altamirani ' ' ) is a species of mole salamander that only lives in central Mxico. # Description # The mountain stream salamander grows to be about 115 mm long . Its tail is slender , has a low fin along the top , and an even smaller fin on the bottom of the tail . The tail is about 50mm . The limbs are also slender . The dorsal surface and the sides are a purplish-black color , while the belly is a purplish- lavender . The chin and lower surfaces of the limbs are clouded with a light lavender hue . The edges of the lips , tips of the digits , and the fin on the bottom of the tail are a cream color . # Habitat # The mountain stream salamander lives to the west and south of the Valley of Mexico . It lives in an altitude range of 2,700 to 3,200 m above sea level . This species lives and breeds in small streams that flow through high-elevation pine or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streams of cleared pastures . Adult mountain stream salamanders live both on land and in streams . # Ecology # The mountain stream salamander goes through a metamorphic change to become an adult . The salamander starts out as larvae and can only survive in streams . As they mature they gain limbs and the ability to live on land , as well as lose their gills and fins . Some adults , and larvae , stay in the streams year-long , but other adults go off and live on land . The adults will come back to the stream to breed and lay eggs . After laying the eggs , the adult leave their babies , showing no signs of parental care . # Status # The species is currently considered an endangered species because of the huge decreases in population over the past three generations . This decrease has been caused by changes in its habitat . Illegal logging in national parks , very heavy recreational tourism , stream pollution and sedimentation , stream diversion , and the introduced predatory fishes , like trout , have all had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts have all led to the death of the mountain stream species , which then leads to a decrease in the population . Because of this , the species is now protected by the Mexican law under Special Protection ( Pr ) .

The film was released with a ' ' Looney Tunes ' ' short called ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvester Cat and Tweety Bird . The film received mixed reviews but was financially unsuccessful , resulting in the closure of Miller 's Dr. D Studios . # Plot # Erik , son of the penguins Mumble and Gloria , is reluctant to try dancing as most of the penguins in Emperor-Land do . His first attempt at dancing ends in humiliation . Erik and his two best friends , Bodicea and Atticus , follow Ramon to Adlie-Land and find that Adlie-Land has been ruled by a God-like penguin named Sven . Sven is actually a puffin in Adlie-Land who survived the loss of his native fishing grounds ( evidently ruined by a warming climate ) due to his miraculous ability to fly . Erik instantly becomes enamored with Sven , who takes a liking to him . Sven and Lovelace tell the others that they were saved by humans . The two eventually flee ( under Sven 's mistaken assumption that the humans were going to eat them ) and end up on Antarctica , where Sven performs his first miracle by revealing moss to the local penguins . Sven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mate . Ramon instantly falls in love with Carmen , another Adlie penguin who is uninterested . Mumble follows the chicks ' footprints to Adlie-Land and orders them to return to Emperor-Land , but they refuse . Sven sends Erik back to Emperor-Land with Mumble . Meanwhile , a couple of krill are in the midst of a swarm . Will is an adventurous and existentialist krill determined to discover what lies beyond the swarm . His friend , Bill , reluctantly follows him to ensure his safety . Once separated from the swarm , Will and Bill realize that krill are at the bottom of the food chain , created to be eaten . Inspired , Will ventures out to evolve and move up the food chain by eating a real creature instead of being eaten . Mumble tells Erik that he is unique to the world and that he will someday find his calling , but Erik is oblivious . While trying to cross a perilous ice bridge , the penguins encounter Bryan the Beach Master and his two young sons , who refuse to let the penguins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped in a deep crevice below the ice . Mumble sets out to free Bryan by luring a leopard seal to chase him down . Seeking acceptance from Erik , Mumble is devastated to learn Erik attributed the feat of courage to Sven Think . Bryan returns to the Southern elephant seal beach . When the penguins return to Emperor-Land they discover that a large iceberg has trapped the Emperor Penguin population below large walls of ice . Bo ventures out to Adlie-Land to recruit the help of Ramon , the Amigos and the Adlie penguins to bring fish to the doomed Emperor penguins . Meanwhile , Mumble , Erik and Atticus deliver meager supplies of fish to the trapped penguins . Erik attempts to deliver a fish to Gloria by flying and nearly tossing himself over the edge of the iceberg . Mumble scolds Erik for his beliefs , saying that no penguin can fly and that none of the Emperor Penguins will be able to escape . Once Erik realizes Emperor-Land is destined to die , he begins to break down . Gloria sends Mumble off to hunt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor-Land . In the process , Bill becomes inspired to create another swarm of krill but Will refuses , preferring to adhere to his new predator lifestyle . The next morning , a large flock of Skua attack the trapped Emperor-Land . Noah the Elder encourages the penguins to stand up to the birds through perseverance and unity . When all hope seems lost , Bo returns with the entire Adlie-Land , led by Sven , to aid the trapped Emperor Penguins . Sven orchestrates a cooperative effort to feed the trapped Emperor Penguins through hunting and bringing back a flow of fish from the sea . Meanwhile , Will becomes increasingly agitated with Bill 's behavior and leaves him into the Adlie feeding swarm , to join fellow predators . In the process he is attached to a fish carried by Sven and down into the trapped Emperor-Land . The humans that saved Sven and Lovelace come to Antarctica again to help the penguins find a way out . However , a blizzard approaches and causes the humans to flee and not return . Sven reports that the ocean has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans returning or the Adlie Penguins transporting food over such a distance . Erik urges Sven to teach the penguins how to fly , but Sven reveals that he is not a penguin but a Puffin . He admits that after the loss of Svenland , he was lonely and grew to love the penguins who accepted him as a family . Mumble , after watching snow fall into a crevice between chunks of iceberg , begins to tap-dance on the ice and lead the Adlie penguins in a dance to force snow between the ice and weaken it . The plan works until several chunks break loose , sending Bo , Atticus , and a portion of the Adlies as well as several Chinstrap , Little Blue and Magellanic penguins into the doomed crevice . Erik and Lovelace tumble towards the edge , and Mumble grabs the thread from Lovelace 's vest . The thread snaps and Lovelace falls on Sven . Quickly , Mumble and the Amigos pull on the thread that Erik is holding onto and pull him up . Mumble injures his foot and is unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped below and , risking his own life , jumps off the iceberg to be with her and professes their love to each other . Sven becomes aware of the dancing and proves himself to be a worthy dancer despite public outcry against him . He leads the remaining Adlies in dance while Erik and Mumble venture off to the Elephant Seal beach . Meanwhile , Will , weary from the dangers he experienced as a predator on the surface , ventures back into the sea to find Bill , but not before experiencing the penguin 's dancing . He is suddenly forced down a crack in the ice and into the sea beneath Emperor-Land . Reuniting with Bill and his swarm , the krill enter the inaccessible ice below Emperor-Land . Mumble and Erik arrive at Elephant Seal Beach where Bryan is in the middle of a fight of dominance between another large male . Mumble pleads to the elephant seals to help free the Emperor Penguins . Bryan , initially hesitant to return a favor at such a pivotal time of the year , refuses . Discovering his singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryan for his lack of kindness . The elephant seals travel en-masse to Emperor-Land . The penguins and the seals begin slamming the ice on the beat , joined by Will , Bill and their krill swarm below the ice .

4 Villa Carlota is the name under which two German farming settlements , in the villages of Santa Elena and Pustunich in Yucatn , were founded during the Second Mexican Empire ( 18641867 ) . This colonization program is not to be confused with the Carlota Colony , an American settlement in Veracruz . For strategically and political reasons , Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico 's immigration policy included the goal to colonize the Yucatn peninsula with approximately 600 European families of farmers and artisans per year . The leader of this colonization program was the Imperial Commissioner to Yucatn , Jos Salazar Ilarregui . At an operation level , the director was the German engineer and cartographer Moritz von Hippel . Being a pilot program , Villa Carlota attracted 443 German-speaking immigrants , most of them simple farmers and artisans . The majority came as families . The first group , formed by 224 settlers , arrived to the port of Sisal , Yucatn , on October 25 , 1865 . These families settled in Santa Elena , a village with mostly Maya people , around 100 kilometers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 219 colonizers arrived to that same port on July 15 , 1866 ; most of them were send to the tiny village of Pustunich , some to Santa Elena and a few others stayed in Mrida or went to work to other Yucatecan locations , such as Holbox , Laguna de Trminos or Baca. 72% of the colonists came from Prussia and many of them were Protestants . Although in general these immigrants were well received by the hosting society , and the Imperial government apparently honored to the extent of its capabilities the contract it offered to these farmers , the colonies collapsed in 1867 . Passive and perhaps active- opposition from the Yucatecan elite to the project , the inappropriateness of the cultivation tracts for the purpose assigned to the settlement , organizational problems amongst the colonists themselves and the fall of the Second Empire were some of the most important factors leading to the collapse of the program . Relatively soon after having settled in Santa Elena , the settler 's families started to create relationships with the locals . Marriages between Germans and people of Santa Elena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were originally Protestants converted into Catholicism ; many of the ' ' padrinos ' ' were Yucatecans . This explains partly why until our days the oral tradition around this historical event is still so rich . After the disintegration of Villa Carlota as such , some families migrated to other parts of the peninsula , into the United States and back to Germany . Many stayed , however , in Yucatn , where we can find descendents of these pioneers with last names such as Worbis , Dietrich and Sols , among others . The following characteristics are special about Villa Carlota : ( 1 ) It was probably the first case of subsidized migration into Mxico. ( 2 ) Being a working migration , and not an elite one , the Villacarlotans constitute an exceptional case among the Germans who migrated into Mexico . ( 3 ) Contrary to the settlement patterns found in other Latin-American countries , the Villa Carlotans settled within existing Maya communities : this provided many opportunities for intercultural contact , miscegenation and acculturation. ( 4 ) The results brought about by the analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the migration politics of the Second Empire , as well as the idea that only elite German migration was received by Mexico . In 2008 the Archivo Histrico de Mrida Yucatn hosted a large exhibit about this subject , entitled Villa Carlota : Una reconstruccin documental de la historia de las colonias alemanas en Yucatn . Family histories by descendants Some descendants of these pioneers have already started to research on their own and to publish accounts of their family 's histories . # References # 
4 Lord , Mr. Ford is the title of a song written by Dick Feller and recorded by Jerry Reed . It was released in May 1973 as the only single from the album of the same name , ' ' Lord , Mr. Ford ' ' . The single was Jerry Reed 's second of three No. 1 's on the ' ' Billboard ' ' Hot Country Singles chart .

4 Dzongsar Monastery is a Buddhist monastery in Dg County in the Garz Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan , China , southeast of the town of Derge and east of Palpung Monastery . Historically it lay in the Kham region of Tibet . Founded in 746 and destroyed in 1958 , it was rebuilt in 1983 . The monastery belongs to the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism and was the main seat of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and Jamyang Khyentse Chkyi Lodr . However it is noted for its eclecticism of the Rim movement and its openness to most of the teaching sects of Tibetan Buddhism . # History # # Old monastery # Dzongsar Gonpa was originally founded in 746 AD by a Bnpo Lama . Originally there was just a very small temple at this site , called Jowo-Lha-Chig-Kar-Chig and the Bnpo shrine remained until 1958 . The original Bnpo Gonpa was later transformed into a Nyingma and a Kadampa temple at some stage but it was n't until 1275 that it was founded as a Sakya monastery by Drogn Chgyal Phagpa on his return from China . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident monks , but frequently contained many more people who camped around the monastery in tents to meet with the lamas . All the temples were destroyed in 1958 , but rebuilding began in 1983 under the guidance of Dr. Lodr Puntsok . The monastery had twenty three temples , large and small , and many important sacred rooms . It contained hermitages such as Khamshe Shekdra , Karmo Taktsang retreat centre , Gargu Shangchub Rihtrek retreat centre , Zamnang Pema Shelpuk , Zingkhok Trawo retreat centre , Tsedrak Drulphuk , Gyalgen Chungtak , Munong Dorjee Drakal , Tsa-chu-juk Chenresig Lhakang , Honda Thongthong Gyalpo , and others . Dzongsar had a unique collection of Rim scriptures and teachings , gathered by the proponents of the Rime movement , Jamgon Kongtrul , Chokyi Lingpa and Khyentse Wangpo . Although Dzongsar was a Sakya monastery by principle it was known to be flexible in its teachings and made it possible to study eight sects of Buddhism . # New monastery # In 1983 the temples and institutions of the monastery were rebuilt but not in its full glory . It now only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and eighty monk 's residences have been rebuilt and today the main temples cover 48,200 square meters . Today there are more than 200 monks residing at Dzongsar . Dzongsar also runs a school teaching Tibetan traditions , and has an enrollment of about 60 children . The monastery is also known for its incense and sells it commercially as Dzongsar Tibetan Incense Powder and Dzongsar Tibetan Incense Sticks . The incense is made from precious , natural herbal materials from the highlands of Eastern Tibet and is said to have healing effects for the mind and soul , and have the ability to prevent infectious diseases . The current head lama of Dzongsar is the Bhutanese Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche who was brought up in Sikkim. **6;64610;br **6;64618;br **6;64626;br 
4 Chen Yixing ( ) ( died 844 ) , courtesy name Zhoudao ( ) , was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty , serving twice as a chancellor during the reigns of Emperor Wenzong and Emperor Wuzong . He was viewed as a Li Faction leader in the Niu-Li Factional Struggles . # Background and early career # It is not known when Chen Yixing was born . It was said that his family had its origins south of the Yangtze River , but had , for generations , lived in Yingchuan ( , in modern Luoyang , Henan ) . Neither his grandfather Chen Zhong ( ) nor his father Chen Yong ( ) was listed with any offices in the table of the chancellors ' family trees in the ' ' New Book of Tang ' ' , suggesting that neither had an official title . He had at least three younger brothers , Chen Xuanxi ( ) , Chen Yize ( ) , and Chen Yishi ( ) . In 812 , during the reign of Emperor Xianzong , Chen passed the imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thereafter , he served on the staffs of several regional governors . As of the end of ' ' Baoli ' ' era ( 825-827 ) of Emperor Xianzong 's grandson Emperor Jingzong , Chen was serving as an imperial censor with the title of ' ' Shiyushi ' ' ( ) , and serving at the eastern capital Luoyang , when he was made ' ' Yubu Yuanwailang ' ' ( ) , a low-level official at the ministry of public works ( , ' ' Gongbu ' ' ) . He continued to serve at Luoyang. # During Emperor Wenzong 's reign # # Before chancellorship # In 829 , during the reign of Emperor Jingzong 's brother Emperor Wenzong , Chen Yixing was recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as an imperial chronicler ( , ' ' Qijulang ' ' ) , and he also served as an editor in imperial history , participating in the compilation of the chronicles of Emperor Xianzong 's reign . After those chronicles of Emperor Xianzong 's reigns were presented to Emperor Wenzong in 830 , Chen was made ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ministry of civil service affairs ( , ' ' Libu ' ' ) . In 831 , he was promoted to be ' ' Libu Langzhong ' ' ( ) , a supervisory official at the ministry of civil service affairs . Later in the same year , he was also made an imperial scholar ( , ' ' Hanlin Xueshi ' ' ) . In 834 , he was also made a tutor to the Crown Prince Li Yong and ordered to attend to and lecture Li Yong on the Confucian classics once every five days . He was further given the office of ' ' Jianyi Daifu ' ' ( ) , an advisory official , and put in charge of drafting edicts . In 835 , he was made the deputy minister of worship ( , ' ' Taichang Shaoqing ' ' ) , and continued to serve in his capacities as imperial scholar , tutor to Li Yong , and drafter of edicts. # During and after chancellorship # In 837 , when Chen Yixing was also serving as the deputy minister of public works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was made a chancellor ' ' de facto ' ' with the designation ' ' Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ' ' ( ) , serving alongside Li Shi and Zheng Tan . As of 838 , by which time Li Shi had resigned and Yang Sifu and Li Jue had been made chancellors as well , it was said that Chen was honest in his opinions and therefore despised Yang for what he viewed as Yang 's grab on power , and they often argued when discussing policy matters . Chen thus offered to resign , but Emperor Wenzong declined his resignation . After this incident , he continued to frequently , in veiled terms , accuse Yang of stealing imperial authority while discussing issues . ( Modern historians such as Bo Yang viewed these arguments as factional in nature , and considered Chen and Zheng to be among the leaders of the Li Faction in the Niu-Li Factional Struggles ( named after Li Deyu ) , while viewing Yang and Li Jue to be among the leaders of the Niu Faction ( named after Niu Sengru ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former chancellor Li Zongmin , also considered a Niu Faction leader , who had been exiled , promoted and moved closer to the capital , Chen opposed vehemently , and it was said that from this point on , all policy arguments were complicated by partisan issues , making it difficult for Emperor Wenzong to rule on them . In 839 , there was a major argument that led to the removals of Chen and Zheng . Emperor Wenzong had praised the talents of the acting director of finances , Du Cong . Yang and Li Jue thereafter recommended Du to be the ministry of census . Chen responded , Such orders should come from the Emperor . In the past , those who lost stately sovereignty did so by losing their authorities to their subjects . Li Jue responded , Your Imperial Majesty had told me previously that an Emperor should select chancellors , not suspect them . In a subsequent discussion , Chen again emphasized that the Emperor should not yield authority to his subjects . Li Jue , offended , responded , Chen Yixing is obviously suspecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperial Majesty . I have often requested retirement , and I would be fortunate to be given a post as an imperial prince 's teacher . Zheng then stated , Your Imperial Majesty ruled well in the first and second years of the ' ' Kaicheng ' ' era ( i.e. , 836 and 837 ) , while less so in the third and fourth years of ' ' Kaicheng ' ' ( i.e. , 838 and 839 ) . Yang responded , In the first and second years , Zheng Tan and Chen Yixing were in power . In the third and fourth years , your subject and Li Jue joined them . Of course , the crime is mine . He then stated , I do not dare to again enter the Office of the Chancellors ! He withdrew from Emperor Wenzong 's presence . Emperor Wenzong subsequently sent a eunuch to comfort him , and Zheng partially apologized , stating , Your subject is foolish . I did not intend to point at Yang Sifu , but Yang Sifu 's reaction shows that he has no tolerance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governance is deteriorating year by year . This does not only incriminate your subject , but also speaks ill of your holy virtues . Yang then submitted multiple offers to resign . Soon thereafter , Zheng and Chen were stripped of their chancellor posts . Chen , instead , was made the deputy minister of civil service affairs ( , ' ' Libu Shilang ' ' ) . Later in the year , he was sent out of the capital to serve as the prefect of Hua Prefecture ( , in modern Weinan , Shaanxi ) . # During Emperor Wuzong 's reign # In 841 , by which time Emperor Wenzong 's brother Emperor Wuzong was emperor and Li Deyu was the leading chancellor , Chen Yixing was recalled from Hua Prefecture , apparently first to serve as chief imperial censor ( , ' ' Yushi Daifu ' ' ) , and then again chancellor , as well ' ' Menxia Shilang ' ' ( ) , the deputy head of the examination bureau of government ( , ' ' Menxia Sheng ' ' ) . Later that year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Yang Sifu and Li Jue , whom he had stripped of chancellor posts and sent out of Chang'an because he believed that they did not support him as emperor , became further incensed by the powerful eunuch Qiu Shiliang against Yang and Li Jue , as well as two eunuchs trusted by Emperor Wenzong Liu Hongyi ( ) and Xue Jileng ( ) that he ordered Liu and Xue to commit suicide , and further sent eunuchs with orders to force Yang and Li Jue to commit suicide as well . After Du Cong pointed out to Li Deyu that it was unwise to let Emperor Wuzong to be accustomed to kill officials , Li Deyu , Chen , and fellow chancellors Cui Gong and Cui Dan interceded . As a result , Yang and Li Jue were spared of their lives , but further demoted . Chen was himself soon involved in a policy argument against Li Deyu , as Tang 's long-time ally and vassal Huigu had recently been defeated by Xiajiasi , and Huigu remnants were approaching Tang borders . One major group of Huigu remnants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tiande ( , in modern Bayan Nur , Inner Mongolia ) and sought food aid , offering to submit to Tang . The defender of Tiande , Tian Mou ( ) , suggested that Wamosi 's offer be rejected and that Tang forces attack him , along with allied Tuyuhun , Shatuo , and Dangxiang tribes . Li Deyu opined differently , believing that Wamosi 's offer should be accepted and that food should be supplied to the Huigu remnants . Chen opposed Li Deyu , arguing that in effect , it would be aiding the enemy . Emperor Wuzong eventually agreed with Li Deyu . In 842 , after Wamosi had made a trip to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Wuzong , Chen was relieved of his chancellor post and made ' ' Zuo Pushe ' ' ( ) , one of the heads of the executive bureau ( , ' ' Shangshu Sheng ' ' ) . In 843 , Chen was sent out of the capital to serve as the military governor ( ' ' Jiedushi ' ' ) of Hezhong Circuit ( , headquartered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor of its capital Hezhong Municipality . He was also given the honorary title of acting ' ' Sikong ' ' ( , one of the Three Excellencies ) and ' ' Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ' ' .

He died in 844 and was given posthumous honors. # Notes and references # * ' ' Book of Tang ' ' , vol. 173. * ' ' New Book of Tang ' ' , vol. 181. * ' ' Zizhi Tongjian ' ' , vols. 245 , 246 , 247. 
4 Taxation in Puerto Rico takes the form of both Federal and Commonwealth taxes . Puerto Rico has independent tax-levying authority by provisions of of the United States code . # Federal taxes # Though the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws , Puerto Ricans are also required to pay most U.S. federal taxes , with the major exception being that some residents do not have to pay the federal personal income tax . In 2009 , Puerto Rico paid into the US Treasury . Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security , and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement . However , they are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) , and the island actually receives a small fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U.S. state . Also , Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico , even though the latter paid fully into the system . The federal taxes paid by Puerto Rico residents include import/export taxes , Federal commodity taxes , social security taxes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Social Security and Medicare taxes . Only certain Puerto Ricans are required to file federal income tax forms . According to the Internal Revenue Service : In general , United States citizens and resident aliens who are bona fide residents of Puerto Rico during the entire tax year , which for most individuals is January 1 to December 31 , are only required to file a U.S. federal income tax return if they have income sources outside of Puerto Rico or if they are employees of the U.S. government . Bona fide residents of Puerto Rico generally do not report income received from sources within Puerto Rico on their U.S. income tax return . However , they should report all income received from sources outside Puerto Rico on their U.S. income tax return . Residents of Puerto Rico who are employed by the government of the United States or who are members of the armed forces of the United States also should report all income received for their services to the government of the United States on their U. S. income tax return . United States citizens or resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the entire tax year are required to report all income from whatever source derived on their U.S. income tax return . However , a U.S. citizen who changes residence from Puerto Rico to the United States and who was a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico at least two years before changing residence can exclude from U.S. taxable income the Puerto Rican source income received while residing in Puerto Rico during the taxable year of such change of residence . Bona fide residents of Puerto Rico can not claim deductions and/or credits allocable to or chargeable against Puerto Rican source income that is excluded from a U.S. tax return . The deductions and credits not attributable to specific income must be divided between excluded income from sources in Puerto Rico and income from all other sources to find the part that can be deducted or credited on a U.S. tax return . Examples of deductions not attributable to specific income include alimony , the standard deduction , and certain itemized deductions such as medical expenses , charitable contributions , and real estate taxes and mortgage interest on your personal residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have taxable Puerto Rican source income on your U.S. income tax return , then you can claim a credit for foreign taxes paid to Puerto Rico . However , you are not allowed to claim a credit for foreign taxes paid with respect to Puerto Rican source income that is excluded from a U.S. tax return . Therefore , to properly calculate your foreign tax credit , you must reduce your foreign taxes paid by the amount of taxes allocable to excluded Puerto Rican source income . Employers in Puerto Rico are subject to both Federal Insurance Contributions Act ( FICA ) tax ( a payroll withholding tax , which funds Social Security and Medicare ) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act ( FUTA ) . Employers in Puerto Rico are legally obligated to withhold the employee portion of FICA taxes from their employees ' wages and contribute the employer portion of FICA. # Commonwealth taxes # Puerto Rico imposes a separate income tax in lieu of Federal income tax . All Federal employees , those who do business with the Federal government , Puerto Rico-based corporations that intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay Federal income taxes ( for example , Puerto Rican residents that are members of the U.S. military , and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside Puerto Rico ) . In addition , because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U.S. IRS code , and because the per-capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per-capita income on the mainland , more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island . This occurs because the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State and local governments . As residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security , Puerto Ricans are eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement , but are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) ( Commonwealth of Puerto Rico residents , unlike residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and residents of the 50 States , do not receive the SSI ) , and the island actually receives less than 15% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a U.S. state . However , Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico , even though the latter paid fully into the system In general , many federal social welfare programs have been extended to Puerto Rican ( ' ' sic ' ' ) residents , although usually with caps inferior to those allocated to the states . However , it has also been estimated that , because the population of the Island is greater than that of 50% of the States , if it were a state , Puerto Rico would have six to eight seats in the U.S. House of Representatives , in addition to the two seats in the U.S. Senate . A common misconception is that the import/export taxes collected by the U.S. on products manufactured in Puerto Rico are all returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury . This is not the case , as such import/export taxes are returned ' ' only ' ' for rum products , and even then the US Treasury keeps a portion of those taxes . The main body of domestic statutory tax law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rico ( Spanish : ' ' Cdigo de Rentas Internas de Puerto Rico ' ' ) . The code organizes commonwealth laws covering commonwealth income tax , payroll taxes , gift taxes , estate taxes and statutory excise taxes . Puerto Rico has commonwealth income taxes . Because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the federal Internal Revenue Code , and because the per capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per capita income on the mainland , more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the federal Internal Revenue Code were applied to the island . # Sales tax # On July 4 , 2006 , the government approved Law Number 117 , The 2006 Contributive Justice Law , establishing a tax with a 5.5% rate at state level and an optional 1.5% rate at municipal level . The tax went into effect on November 15 , 2006 . The tax is better known as the ' ' Sales and Use Tax ( ' ' Impuesto sobre Ventas y Uso ' ' ) , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended Article B of the Code and created sub-article BB . On July 29 , 2007 , the government approved Law Number 80 , making the tax mandatory for all municipalities of the island . Also the tax rates changed to 6% at the state level and 1% at the municipal level . The tax originated in some municipalities ( Caguas , Yauco and Villalba ) in 2005 . Seeing the economic success of these municipalities , many other municipalities enacted sales tax ordinances , usually by copying the ordinance of Caguas . By the middle of 2006 , more than 30 municipalities had enacted sales and uses taxes on the island . During the second and third quarters of 2006 , the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico suffered several political struggles in its Legislative Assembly . These were largely caused of the budget deficit of the government and the refusal of the Legislative Assembly to approve the taxes proposed by the Governor of the Island . Government offices were shut down until the Assembly approved the law 117 which included the first sales tax of that possession of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales tax was approved with a 5.5% rate at state level and an optional 1.5% rate at municipal level . The adoption of the municipal tax was mixed . The tax went into effect on November 15 , 2006 . Since the tax reform of July 2007 , the tax is applied in all 78 municipalities of the island and at Commonwealth level . The tax rates are 6% at the state level and 1% at the municipal level . On February 6 , 2008 the governor of the island proposed to remove the state part of the IVU.

4 # Genre # Tales of Heich ( ' Heich monogatari ' ) belongs to the genre of uta monogatari poem tales that emerged in Japanese literature from the mid 10th to the early 11th centuries . As early as the Collection of Ten-Thousand Leaves ( Manysh ) , a poetry collection completed around 759 , there appeared poems introduced by brief prose narrations . The imperial court began to come alive with poetry from around this time . People exchanged poetry with one another on topics as diverse as love and politics and religion . Towards the end of the 9th century it was common for individual poets to keep compilations of their own verse , sometimes explaining in prose the circumstances behind a poem 's composition . The highest honor was to have ones poem selected for inclusion in the Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry ( Kokinsh ) , the first imperial poetry collection , which was completed around 905 . By the middle of the 10th century the idea of a poem paired with a prose narration seems to have taken hold , and Tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Tales of Yamato ( Yamato monogatari ) seem to have emerged at about this same time . Also , the second imperial poetry collection , Collection of Later Poetry ( Gosensh ) , commissioned in 951 and compiled shortly thereafter , has many narrative qualities . The only extant manuscript of Tales of Heich is a 61-page codex discovered in 1931 that seems to date from the Kamakura Period ( 11851333 ) , some three hundred years after the work 's probable date of composition . # Author # The author of Tales of Heich could have been Taira no Sadafun , whose name appears variously as Sadafun , Sadabun , Sadafumi , and Sadabumi ( 870 ? -923 ? ) , but more likely it was compiled by someone else after his death on the basis of a non extant personal poetry collection compiled by Sadafun himself and popular legends developing after his death . With nine poems by Sadafun in the Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry , he ranks fourteenth out of the 120 poets whose work appears in the only imperial anthology compiled during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , is the first narrative work to equate the names Sadafun and Heich . It has been traditionally assumed that the stories about Heich were based on episodes in the life of the historical person Taira no Sadafun , but modern scholarship has never been able to prove this . Tales of Heich may have reflected the real Sadafun , but clearly the intent of the work was not simply biographical . Indeed , it may have been wholly fictional or based merely on hazy memories of an historical personage already deceased . In the stories Heich is a courtier of imperial blood whose family has known better days . Though only of middling rank in the government bureaucracy , however , he was recognized in his own time as a sensitive poet of some talent . # Heich Legend # By the mid tenth century , soon after Sadafun 's death , his amatory escapades began to appear in Tales of Ise , Tales of Heich , and Tales of Yamato . These stories continued to be told with changes and additions over the next 1000 years , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . Different authors focused on the characteristics of the hero that interested them most , whether sensitive poet or spurned lover . Later the amatory ideal turns into a profligate rake and then a ridiculous clown . Sometimes his portrayed immorality became the basis for a lecture or sermon illustrating some moral issue . He became the object of historical researches , and eventually appeared in a pornographic tale or two . Heich provided a fluid and varied image as different authors used him to further their own moral and narrative ends . Within the first fifty years of the legend 's formation there appeared three of the four stock stories associated with Heich : The ' mitsu ' I have seen it ! story , which is the germ of the more elaborate story of Hon'in Jij that emerges fully developed nearly two centuries later in Tales of Times Now Past ; Fragments of the story of Kunitsune 's wife whose kidnapping later become the basis for more detailed narrations involving Heich and Fujiwara no Tokihira ; The story of Musashi , the maiden who takes the tonsure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single night of love-making . Another 50 years later there emerges the fourth major story of the Heich legend : The ' suminuri ' ink-blackening story in which Heich inadvertently blackens his face with tears of ink . Clearly by the end of the tenth century readers were beginning to laugh at the excesses of Heich , who had once been appreciated as a lover of refined sensibility and elegant poems .

514 An all-weather running track is a rubberized artificial running surface for track and field athletics . It provides a consistent surface for competitors to test their athletic ability unencumbered by adverse weather conditions . Historically , various forms of dirt , grass , sand and crushed cinders were used . Many examples of these varieties of track still exist worldwide . # Measurement of a track # The proper length for a competitive running track is 400mft 1 . Some tracks are not built to this specification , instead some are legacy to imperial distances like 440ydm 1 . Prior to rule changes in 1979 , imperial distances were still used in the United States . Some facilities build tracks to fit the available space . Olympic tracks in the early 20th century were of other lengths . Each lane of the track could ( by IAAF rules should ) be as wide as 122cmft 2 , though the majority of American tracks are built to NFHS high school specifications that allow smaller lanes . The IAAF also specifies a preferred radius for the turns at 37 metres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are conducted and world records are allowed to be set on tracks that are not exactly 37 metres , but do fall in the range . # History # Starting in the late 1950s , artificial surfaces using a combination of rubber and asphalt began to appear . An artificial warm up track was constructed for the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne , Australia . During the 1960s many of these tracks were constructed , examples still exist today . Their survival are a testament to the durability and inconsistency of these early attempts . In the mid-1960s Tartan tracks , surfaced with a product by 3M . The name Tartan is a trademark , but many have misused it as a genericized trademark . This process was the first to commercialize a polyurethane surface for running tracks , though originally conceived for horse racing . Many Tartan tracks were installed worldwide including at many of the top Universities in the United States . Among that list was a Tartan track installed in the Estadio Olmpico Universitario , home of the 1968 Summer Olympics at Mexico City which were the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putt champion Bill Nieder was instrumental in developing the product and selling it for this first use in the Olympics . An all-weather surface has become standard ever since . Another Tartan track was installed on a temporary basis for the 1968 United States Olympic Trials held at altitude at Echo Summit , California , before being moved to South Tahoe Middle School , where it survived for almost 40 years . An original Tartan track is still in place ( though horribly mistreated ) at Speed City San Jose State University on a satellite to the campus at 10th Street and Alma . Years of the abuse of tractors tearing it and cars parked on it shows the durability of this original product . Surfacing tracks has become an industry with many competitors . * Tartan ; The legacy of the brand is now known as Tartan APS * Chevron 440 ; was a popular surface of the mid-1970s * Rekortan ; was invented and used for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich , Germany and is still licensed Worldwide * Eurotan * Martin ISS was another 1970 's development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Plexitracs and there are other techniques that distribute small chunks of rubber then adhere them in place with various Polyurethane or latex substances . The International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) , international governing body of the sport , publishes very specific regulations for the conduct of a Global Championship or International level track meet ( which is their jurisdiction of the sport ) . Since its inception in the early-1980s , the manufacturer of the surfaces selected for most championship meets has been by the Italian company , Mondo , again the trademarked brand name becoming misused as a genericized trademark . Mondo surfaces differ in that they are more of a rubber carpet , cut to size then tightly seamed together ( in the linear direction along the lane lines ) . This form of construction gives a more consistent bounce ( or energy return ) and traction . Because of the tight fit specifications required for manufacture , construction surrounding these sites also has to be of a higher standard , making Mondo also one of the most expensive systems to use .

Estdio Olmpico Joo Havelange , the future home of the 2016 Summer Olympics also has a Mondo surface .

4 Natalie White ( born April 22 , 1983 ) is a former reality TV personality known for being the winner of ' ' Survivor : Samoa ' ' . A native of Van Buren , Arkansas , White has a background in marketing and pharmaceutical sales . # Early life # White is the daughter of Ken and Diane Powell of Bryant , Arkansas . She graduated from Bryant High School and went on to Arkansas State University in Jonesboro for two years where she was a member of Alpha Omicron Pi . She then transferred to the University of Central Arkansas in Conway , where she completed a bachelors degree in marketing in 2005. # Survivor : Samoa # White was in the Foa Foa tribe which lost 5 out of the 6 immunity challenges prior to the merge of the two tribes . She survived all those rounds without her name ever being written down for elimination . After the merge had occurred , White orchestrated the elimination of Erik Cardona by swaying Laura Morett , Kelly Sharbaugh , and Monica Padilla to convince the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Tribal Council , White 's plan came into fruition and Cardona became the first member of the jury . The day after tribal council , White came across a rat at camp . She subsequently clubbed the rat to death and presented it to her fellow tribe members for consumption , shocking them all . On the 10th episode , White was almost voted off in a 5-5 tie with Laura Morett . On the revote , John Fincher switched his vote from White to Morett , ensuring Morett 's elimination and saving White . White won her first reward challenge with Laura Morett , Russell Hantz , Brett Clouser , and Dave Ball . In the Survivor Auction , White won a peanut butter and jelly sandwich , and a shower . White had bonded with Clouser over things that they both enjoy , like Christian books and excerpts . She later went on to choose Clouser first to be on her team at the reward challenge . Hantz was suspicious that something was forming between them , but White assured him that everything was proceeding as originally planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed by Hantz that if Clouser were to win the next immunity challenge , she would be the next one leaving . Hantz wanted to get Clouser out before the Final Three , and he needed all of the strongest men to beat Clouser . Clouser went on to win the next immunity challenge , but Hantz 's mind changed , as he needed White to go with him to the Final Three . Jaison Robinson was voted off in that Tribal Council . In the final immunity challenge , White placed third out of four . Hantz went on to win that immunity challenge , leading up to Clouser 's elimination . White was criticized by Hantz and the jury for being a coattail rider and that she had not done much except follow Hantz . White responded with the fact that she could not make the moves that Hantz did because that would lead to her being voted out . She said that her best move that would keep her in the game was to align with Hantz , and that he could take all the damage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardona finished the Final Tribal Council by stating that Mick Trimming had not lived up to his leader position , and that Hantz was arrogant . He stated that White might call herself the least deserving of the title Sole Survivor but that maybe the person who thinks she is the least deserving is probably the most . Cardona went on to say that he would be voting for her , and he hoped that she would get four more votes to win . On December 20 , 2009 , during the live portion of the finale , it was announced that White had won the title of Sole Survivor for the season , ' ' Survivor : Samoa ' ' . She won by a vote of 7-2-0 , defeating runner-up Russell Hantz and third placed Mick Trimming . After he realized that he had lost , Hantz first offered White $10,000 for the title of Sole Survivor but she could keep the $1,000,000 prize . He then increased his offer to $100,000 . White declined both offers . # Personal life # At the time of the filming of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dating Justin Thomas , who is also a resident of Van Buren .

9514 The Rimutaka Incline railway accident occurred on 11 September 1880 when the leading three carriages on a Greytown to Wellington train were blown off the track in strong winds near the Siberia tunnel ; killing three passengers . The Rimutaka Incline section of the line over the Rimutaka Ranges between Wellington and the Wairarapa used the Fell system on the steep 1 in 15 section which was 4.8km mi long . A small train left Greytown at 8.30am bound for Wellington . At Cross Creek , at the foot of the Rimutaka Ranges , a Fell Engine ( H class ) was added to the train to push it up the steep 1 in 15 ascent to the summit of the Rimutaka Incline . At Cross Creek the two passenger cars and the luggage carriage were put in front of the engine . Then behind this were two wagons of timber and lastly the Fell brake van . All went well until the train reached an area of the incline known as Siberia . A strong north-west wind was blowing across the track . A terrific gust hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railway line . The body of the first carriage was torn from its mountings and the passengers were thrown on to the hillside , although the couplings held . The weight of the engine prevented the carriages from falling into the valley below , and the grip of the engine on the raised centre-rail saved the whole train from destruction and more loss of life . The engine and brake van also had brakes which gripped the raised centre rail . The rear brakesman uncoupled his van and piloted the van down the incline to Cross Creek to get help . Three children were killed instantly and there were many injuries , some horrific . One of the injured , Stanley George Nicholas aged 5 years , died later from injuries received .

514 Silicone scar sheets are a type of treatment used to prevent the formation of new scars and to reduce the appearance of existing scars . The scar sheet is lined on one side with silicone gel . The other side is often lined with a smooth fabric or a transparent film . The treatment of scars has been of great interest to plastic surgeons , hospitals , and burn centers for many years . # Effectiveness # The effectiveness and safety of silicone sheet technology for the treatment and prevention of scars is supported by a number of clinical studies . There have been more controlled clinical trials performed on the treatment of scars using silicone gel sheets than most other methods . A meta-study published in the Cochrane Library concluded that it is unclear whether silicon gel sheeting helps prevent scarring . It found that many of the studies advocating their use were of poor quality and susceptible to bias . 
4 Abraham Samuel , also known as Tolinar Rex , born in Martinique ( or possibly in Anosy , Madagascar ) , was a mulatto pirate of the Indian Ocean in the days of the Pirate Round in the late-1690s . Being shipwrecked on his way back to New York , he briefly led a combined pirate-Antanosy kingdom from Fort Dauphin ( see Tolanaro ) , Madagascar , from 1697 until he died there in 1705. # Life # One of the incidents during Samuel 's rule of the Fort Dauphin area was the following .

These authors also note that Cruger had so antagonized the crew on the front end of the journey , including one New Yorker of African origins , that by the time they reached Sao Tome , the Captain indicated they would mutiny if not paid at least some of their wages . As noted above , Cruger sold some of the ship 's rigging to pay for this . For more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

514 A Brown Betty is a type of teapot , round and with a manganese brown glaze known as Rockingham glaze . The original teapots came from a red clay that was discovered in the Stoke-on-Trent area of Britain , in 1695 . This special clay seemed to retain heat better and so found use as the material for the teapot as early as the seventeenth century . These early pots were tall and shaped more like coffee pots . In the nineteenth century the pots began to take on the more rounded shape of the modern Brown Betty . The Rockingham Glaze was brushed on the pot and allowed to run down the sides , creating a streaky finish as it was fired . In the Victorian era , when tea was at its peak of popularity , tea brewed in the Brown Betty was considered excellent . This was attributed to the design of the pot which allowed the tea leaves more freedom to swirl around as the water was poured into the pot , releasing more flavour with less bitterness .

0514 Elden Pueblo was a prehistoric Native American village located at the foot of Mount Elden near Flagstaff , Arizona . The Pueblo is thought to have been part of a major trading system . Various trade items such as macaw skeletons from Mexico as well as shell jewelry from the coast of California have been found throughout the site . The area is now protected and is used for research and educational purposes . # History # The area was settled by the Sinagua peoples from approximately AD.1070 to 1275 . It is believed that the site was home to 200-300 people within 60-70 rooms . Aside from the structures constructed of compacted stones , a burial mound was discovered near the site . Two individual burials were found under the site . The site was discovered by Harold Colton and originally named it Sheep Hill Pueblo . When Jesse Walter Fewkes excavated it in 1926 and shipped all of the recovered skeletons and pots to the Smithsonian , it created a controversy with Arizona 's archeologists including Colton and Byron Cummings of the University of Arizona . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various outraged Arizona newspapers . The controversy was part of the impetus for the 1927 Arizona Antiquities Act and the creation of the Northern Arizona Society of Science and Art . There is some controversy about the burial mound ; some say the mound is simply a dirt pile from the nearby Fewkes ' excavation . Ruins from another structure were also found underneath the mound which also leads to questions its authenticity . Archeological studies have uncovered information regarding architectural design and the social hierarchy of the Sinagua people . Social hierarchy can be deduced from the variations in burial techniques as well as the decorative features of the grave . Although it has been stated that the Winona meteorite was found at Elden Pueblo , it was in fact found at another Sinagua site miles away .

The short lived ' ' Cork Accent ' ' carried the following explanation of the title in every issue : In its first editorial it condemned the ' ' Cork Examiner ' ' as representing a Delvinite form of Catholic Orangism . Further issues covered the resounding success of the eight O'Brienite Independent Nationalists returned in the January 1910 general election , ( soon to become O'Brien 's new national movement , the All-for-Ireland League ) , as well as the political stalemate in the House of Commons . In February a fund was launched at the Cork City Hall for the publication of a new full-scale daily paper , the ' ' Cork Free Press ' ' . # Cork Free Press # The ' ' Cork Free Press ' ' made its appearance on 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three editors . The opening issue carried a splendid leading article by the founder member and staunch supporter of the All-forIreland League , Canon Sheehan of Donerail . The League held its public inaugural meeting in March , and from July all issues had one central theme , to promote the conciliatory principles of the League in achieving Home Rule , with extensive coverage of election meetings in preparation for the December elections . It regularly attacked the Irish Party for allying with ' socialists , secularists and land nationalisers ' . The Redmondite controlled ' ' Freeman 's Journal ' ' countered by rebuking the O'Brienite Independents as dissident factionists . The ' ' Cork Free Press ' ' continually accused the Redmonite ' ' Cork Examiner ' ' of supporting the disreputable Ancient Order of Hibernians . Soon after the appearance of the ' ' Cork Free Press ' ' , however , Herlihy fell out with O'Brien . He had decided to replace the linotype printing machines with newly developed monotype technology , certainly more suitable for book publishing , but not for high-volume newspaper publishing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misprints , and Herlihy was fired . He unsuccessfully sued for unfair dismissal , was then active as a journalist in London and in the mid-1930s , one year editor of the ' ' Irish Press ' ' . Herlihys successor was Hugh Art OGrady , eldest son of Standish James O'Grady , a young Trinity graduate who was sincerely in accord with All-for-Ireland aspirations . The December 1910 general election saw the League victorious in Cork , returning eight MPs , but elsewhere succumbed to clerical opposition . With Home Rule in the offing , the paper reflected the outrage of O'Brien and his party colleagues when Redmond gave way to partition under pressure from Sir Edward Carson , after specific concessions were published in the January 1914 edition of the paper which O'Brien claimed were acceptable to Ulster , to enable it to come in on an All-Ireland Home Rule agreement . The Redmondites saw themselves as achieving Home Rule , the All-for-Ireland League saw them as having achieved partition . When World War I broke in August 1914 , Home Rule was set aside . The ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving support to Irish participation in the war , by telling readers that the war had welded the Irish together and to secure All-Ireland Home Rule it was necessary to join Britain and the Allies in their hour of need . This was so very much in accord with O'Grady 's own martial enthusiasm that he eventually decided to resign his post in 1915 and enlist in the war . The London correspondent of the ' ' Cork Free Press ' ' at the time was Frank Gallagher , a Cork native and from 1915 its third editor , who though himself a separatist , personally admired O'Brien . He had attempted to dissuade O'Brien from his decision to support the war , as he was rightly worried about the negative effects it would have on circulation and on the League , particularly since rising losses and paper shortages forced the paper to become a weekly in mid-1915. # Lean to Sinn Fin # After the Rising in 1916 , Gallagher contacted O'Brien in London to discuss the attitude of the ' ' Cork Free Press ' ' to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the staff would walk out unless the paper took a more favourable attitude . O'Brien capitulated and soon developed admiration for the insurgents ' idealism and their desperation at possible consequences . O'Brien 's ' ' Cork Free Press ' ' soon began to present an altogether favourable attitude towards Sinn Fin , practically becoming a Sinn Fin organ . Though the paper continued to point out the lesson that physical force had been proved useless and that what was needed was a united constitutionalism . The editorials took on a distinctly heroic view of the rebels and damned Redmond and the Irish MPs for their anti- Sinn Fin utterances . The editorial in the issue of 30 September 1916 betrayed all the hesitance about embracing Sinn Fin that had distinguished O'Brien 's attitude over the years : ' ' It is to the Sinn Fin party that Ireland must now look to mould the future of her people ' ' . This mirrored Gallaghers separatist aspirations and that of most of the papers staff . The quasi-separatist attitude of the ' ' Cork Free Press ' ' increased sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial position hopeless . # Suppressed # The paper suffered closure because soon after the appointment of Lord Decies as Chief Press Censor for Ireland . Decies warned the press to be careful about what they published . Such warnings had little effect when dealing with such papers as the ' ' Cork Free Press ' ' . It was suppressed after Gallagher accused the British authorities of lying about the conditions and situation of republican prisoners in the Frongoch internment camp . Finally , when in December 1916 , OBrien ceased publication of the ' ' Cork Free Press ' ' , he lost the last effective link with his constituents . To keep the paper alive since 1910 had cost 30,000 of his wifes savings . In the 1918 general elections , the All-for-Ireland League MPs stood down in favour of Sinn Fin . Frank Gallagher was subsequently founding editor of the ' ' Irish Press ' ' and director of publicity for amon de Valera ( 193135 ) . # Notes

4 TARGIT ( TARGeted Intra-operative radioTherapy ) is a technique of giving radiotherapy to the tissues surrounding a cancer after its surgical removal . The technique was designed in 1998 at the University College London . In patients having lumpectomy for breast cancer , the TARGIT-A(lone) randomized controlled trial ( recruitment from 2000-2012 ) tested whether TARGIT within a risk-adapted approach is non-inferior to conventional course of external beam postoperative radiotherapy given over several weeks . The ongoing TARGIT-B(oost) randomized controlled trial is testing whether TARGIT tumour bed boost given after lumpectomy for breast cancer in younger patients or those with a high risk of recurrence , is superior to conventional external beam radiotherapy boost for breast cancer . # Definition of TARGIT # TARGIT is a method where the radiation is applied during an operation and targeted to the peri-tumoural tisues . TARGIT technique was designed at University College London by ( who coined the TARGIT acronym ) and Michael Baum along with Jeffrey S Tobias in 1998 . The term was first used when the technique was described , and the protocol for a randomised trial was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a special method of intraoperative radiotherapy ( IORT ) . # Rationale of TARGIT # When breast cancer is surgically excised , it can come back ( local recurrence ) in the remaining breast or on the chest wall in a small proportion of women . Adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary if breast cancer is treated by removing only the cancerous lump with a rim of surrounding normal tissue , as it reduces the chance of local recurrence significantly . When cancer does come back , it most commonly occurs in the tissues surrounding the original cancer ( the tumour bed ) , even though there are multicentric cancers in remote areas of the breast . This suggests that it is most important to treat the tumour bed . The rationale for TARGIT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the tumour bed . Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) following surgical removal of the tumor have been time tested and proven to be effective . EBRT is usually given as a course of whole breast radiotherapy and an additional tumour bed boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , the tumour bed where the boost dose should be applied can be missed ( geographical miss ) due to the difficulties in localization of the complex wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used . Additionally , the usual delay ( temporal miss ) between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells . These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumour cells . Furthermore , TARGIT inhibits the stimulating effects of wound fluid on cancer cells , suggesting for the first time , a beneficial effect of intraoperative radiotherapy ( IORT ) on tumour microenvironment. # The TARGIT technique # The machine used for TARGIT is Intrabeam ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) . It is a miniature and mobile X-ray source which emits low energy X-ray radiation ( max. 50 kV ) in isotropic distribution . Due to the higher ionization density caused by soft X-ray radiation in the tissue , the relative biological effectiveness ( RBE ) of low-energy X-rays on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamma rays which are delivered by linear accelerators . The radiation which is produced by mobile radiation systems has a limited range . For this reason , conventional walls are regarded sufficient to stop the radiation scatter produced in the operating room and no extra measures for radiation protection are necessary . This makes IORT for breast cancer by the TARGIT technique available in most operating rooms . The surgical technique is relatively simple but needs to be meticulously followed . # Clinical applications # # TARGIT for breast cancer # The largest experience with IORT using the TARGIT technique and the best evidence for its potentials exists in breast cancer where a substantial number of patients have already been treated . # # TARGIT-A ( Alone ) # # The was an international multicenter prospective randomised phase 3 clinical trial designed to test whether a single dose of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy could replace the usual 3-6 week course of postoperative radiotherapy . The original trial original accrual goal of 2232 breast cancer patients was completed in 2010 and the results were announced at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simultaneously published online on 5 June 2010 in . The local tumour control using single-dose targeted intraoperative radiotherapy was found to be equivalent to several weeks ' of whole breast external beam radiotherapy . The difference in local recurrece rate between the two treatments at 4 years was 0.25% ( 95% CI -1.0% to +1.5% ) which means that TARGIT could be at most 1.5% worse or 1% better than whole breast radiotherapy . TARGIT also caused less radiotherapy related toxicity than whole breast radiotherapy . A brief explanation of the results is at and in a short interview . In an invited lecture at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford in 2010 , quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald , Professor John Boyages , author of ' ' l ' ' expressed concern about the early release of the TARGIT trial . He noted that the average follow-up for all patients in the trial was only 2 years and that this was far too short to determine its routine efficacy . However , this criticism had already been addressed by the authors within the original paper . At the St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consensus amongst over 52 breast cancer expert panelists was that TARGIT alone could be used as the only radiation treatment in selected cases after breast conserving surgery , or as a tumour bed boost instead of external beam radiotherapy boost . At the Miami Breast Cancer conference ( 1417 March 2012 ) , 91% of the audience in the surgical oncology stream felt the same . At the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium ( 38 December 2012 ) , updated results of the , which closed after recruiting 3451 patients , were presented and showed that giving TARGIT at the time of lumpectomy , gives results similar to whole breast radiotherapy in terms of breast cancer control ( particularly in ER PR positive cases ) , with fewer non-breast cancer deaths and a trend for lower overall mortality compared with conventional external beam whole breast radiotherapy . . The breast 's normal tissue tolerance to radiation does not allow a second full-dose course of EBRT , even after several years . TARGIT and other forms of partial breast irradiation may be an option for selected patients with local recurrence of breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main results in the Lancet from this updated analysis of mature data of on 11 November 2013 showed * that with longer follow up , the results are stable , * local recurrence in the conserved breast with TARGIT concurrent with lumpectomy is similar to whole breast radiotherapy , * breast cancer mortality is similar with TARGIT and EBRT , and * deaths from causes other than breast cancer- cardiovascular and other cancers - are significantly reduced . The authors concluded that TARGIT during lumpectomy should be offered as an alternative to whole breast radiotherapy in suitable patients . The results of TARGIT are discussed in . As the effect of radiotherapy on local recurrence of breast cancer is mostly in the first 2-3 years and almost none after the first 5 years , it is thought that sufficiently large number of patients in the TARGIT-A trial have an adequately long follow up # #TARGIT-B ( Boost ) # # ' ' TARGIT as a tumour bed boost : In conventional EBRT , the boost is delivered at the end of a complete course of EBRT . Clinical evidence suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TARGIT the boost can be delivered intraoperatively without any delay and more precisely as compared to conventional EBRT . A multicenter clinical trial has demonstrated that the boost administered with IORT resulted in a lower than expected rate of local recurrence ( 1.73% ) as compared to an EORTC study which used external boost radiation . As a tumour bed boost , TARGIT has been found to have a better than expected effectiveness These results have prompted the inclusion of TARGIT boost as an option to EBRT boost in national clinical guidelines of many countries including Germany . Whether TARGIT is superior to an EBRT boost is being tested in a randomised trial . # TARGIT for other organs # IORT was found to be useful and feasible in the multidisciplinary management of many solid tumours but further studies are needed to determine the benefit more precisely . Single-institution experiences have suggested a role of IORT e.g. in brain tumours and cerebral metastases , spinal metastasis , locally advanced and recurrent rectal cancer , skin cancer , retroperitoneal sarcoma , pancreatic cancer and selected gynaecologic and genitourinary malignancies .

Pilot studies : In a study which examined acute side effects after boost radiation in patients with breast cancer , treatment was well tolerated with no grade 3/4 acute toxicity . Rare adverse effects following TARGIT included wound healing problems ( 2% ) , erythema grade I-II ( 3% ) , palpable seroma ( 6% ) and mastitis ( 2-4% ) . Large prospective randomised study In the randomised TARGIT-A trial , the overall complications was equivalent between TARGIT and whole breast radiotherapy . There were more seroma needing aspiration in the TARGIT group . This was more than compensated for by the more troublesome radiotherapy related side effects that were less common with TARGIT than with whole breast radiotherapy. # Professional Society for Intraoperative Radiation Therapy # In 1998 , the International Society of IORT ( ISIORT ) was formed to foster the scientific and clinical development of IORT .

4 ' ' Williella ' ' is a genus of moths belonging to the subfamily Tortricinae of the family Tortricidae. # Details # The moth genus ' ' Williella ' ' , family Tortricidae , subfamily Tortricinae , was established in 1984 to accommodate two newly-described species from New Caledonia : ' ' Williella sauteri ' ' and ' ' Williella angulata ' ' . ' ' Williella ' ' was tentatively assigned to the base of the Archipini . Phylogenetic analysis of their plesiomorphic morphology suggested that ' ' Williella ' ' species are members of a group of isolated and generalized moths from Australia , New Zealand and South America . The discovery of the genus in New Caledonia suggested that these plesiomorphic modern Tortricinae are isolated descendants of a group of very generalized Tortricinae that were distributed throughout the Gondwana supercontinent before it broke up into many of the main modern landmasses of the Southern Hemisphere . # Species # * ' ' Williella angulata ' ' <small> Horak , 1984 </small> * ' ' Williella picdupina ' ' <small> Razowski , 2013 </small> * ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

4 A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing , usually a crankshaft main bearing of a piston engine . Most bearing caps are retained by two bolts , one on each side of the bearing journal , and parallel to the cylinder axis . A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts , at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes . These bolts may be either a single through bolt passing through the crankcase from one side to the other , or else two blind bolts threaded into the bearing cap from each side . Cross-bolting has two advantages : it couples the two sides of the crankcase together , making it stiffer overall and less prone to twisting . Secondly it helps to hold the bearing cap down against the downward force from the piston . This second advantage is usually only possible with blind bolts , as the dowel effect of a through bolt is less effective .

514 The Ausco-Lambert disc brake is an unusual brake where an axially-expanding shoe assembly is sandwiched between two linked rotating discs . It may be thought of as an inside out disc brake : instead of pads pinching a disc , the pads expand inside a hollow disc . # History # Ausco-Lambert brakes were introduced in late 1948 and used commercially in some Chrysler cars and some Farmall tractors . The 1950 Crosley Hot Shot is often given credit for the first production disc brakes but the Chrysler Crown Imperial actually had them first as standard equipment at the beginning of the 1949 model year . The Crosley disc was a Goodyear development , a caliper type with ventilated rotor , originally designed for aircraft applications . Lack of sufficient research caused enormous reliability problems , especially in regions requiring the use of salt on winter roads , such as sticking and corrosion . Drum brake conversion for Hot Shots was quite popular . The Chrysler 4-wheel disc brake system was more complex and expensive than Crosley 's , but far more efficient and reliable . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Joseph , Michigan , under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert , and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth . Unlike the caliper disc , the Ausco-Lambert utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast iron brake drum , which doubled as the brake housing . The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders . Chrysler discs were self energizing , in that some of the braking energy itself contributed to the braking effort . This was accomplished by small balls set into oval holes leading to the brake surface . When the disc made initial contact with the friction surface , the balls would be forced up the holes forcing the discs further apart and augmenting the braking energy . This made for lighter braking pressure than with calipers , avoided brake fade , promoted cooler running and provided one-third more friction surface than standard Chrysler twelve-inch drums . But because of the expense , the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Crown Imperial through 1954 and the Town and Country Newport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Chryslers , priced around $400 , at a time when an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935 . Today 's owners consider the Ausco-Lambert very reliable and powerful , but admit its grabbiness and sensitivity . # Pad Expansion # The Ausco-Lambert brake has an unusual mechanism to expand the brake pads . It uses two flat rings , both with pad material on one side and conical divots on the other side . Two rings are placed together with the conical divots facing together and a ball bearing in each pair of divots . When the rings are rotated relative to each other , the balls roll up the ramp faces of the conical divots , pushing apart the two rings . # Self Energizing # The Ausco-Lambert brake is self-energizing . It holds one ring rigidly and lets the other rotate freely , without a stop . The rotation direction is arranged so the direction of free rotation is the same as the hollow brake disc . Thus , the disc tends to pull the ring in the direction that further applies the brake . A shallower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brakes are more subject to brake fade , but it appears part of the Ausco Lambert design is to reduce the exponential gain of drum and band brakes , and thus reduce grabbiness and hot fade . # Self Release # When the disc rotates the opposite direction of ring rotation , the brake tends to self-release . This is common also for drum brakes and is acceptable for uses where hard braking is in one direction . # References #

When the monarchy was restored in 1874 following the First Spanish Republic , they united with the Liberal Union to form the Liberal-Conservative Party under the direction of Antonio Cnovas del Castillo. # Ideology # The party 's political ideology of moderatism ( ) is comparable to British conservatism and , especially , to French doctrinairism , from whom its ideologues ( especially Juan Donoso Corts ) took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *Strong royal power *Pure capitalism *Domestic peace *Total centralism , with all power emanating from Madrid . # Support # The Moderate Party was supported by part of the Army ( the moderate ' ' espadones ' ' such as General Narvez ) , landowners ( a landowning oligarchy of traditional aristocrats and upper bourgeoisie , especially the large landowners owners , the ' ' latifundistas ' ' of Andalusia and the Meseta Central ) , and a portion of the middle class ( the so-called ' ' gente de orden ' ' people of order ) . Economically the party tended to support free trade , allowing the export of agricultural surplus , a policy compatible with the interests of its social base . Electorally , they defended limited suffrage , in particular ' ' sufragio censitario ' ' , census suffrage that limited the electoral census to the wealthy , only those who owned a certain amount of property or paid a certain amount of taxes .

4 The Kansas Supreme Court has ruled that the necessity defense may not be used when the harm the defendant claims to be avoiding through his actions was legal , while the action undertaken to prevent it was illegal . This question became an issue in the 2010 trial of Scott Roeder for the assassination of notorious late-term abortion provider George Tiller . Judge Warren Wilbert refused to allow the defense to present a plea of necessity , but did allow them to present a case for voluntary manslaughter on the grounds that the defendant sincerely believed that he was committing a crime to prevent a greater evil . 
4 commander1=Commodore Horatio Nelson Lieutenant Thomas Hardy The Action of 19 December of 1796 was a minor naval engagement of the French Revolutionary Wars , fought off the coast of Murcia between a small squadron of two British frigates under Commodore Horatio Nelson and a small squadron of two Spanish frigates under Commodore Don Jacobo Stuart , who was descendent of the British royal house of Stuart . Nelson managed to capture one of the Spanish frigates , but the unexpected appearance of superior Spanish forces forced him to withdraw hurriedly abandoning his prize . # Background # By October of 1796 , the Genoese position in Corsica and the continued French advances led the British to decide that the Mediterranean fleet could no longer be supplied and they ordered it to be evacuated to Gibraltar . Commodore Nelson was then required to cover the evacuation of the British garrison at the island of Elba . He was sailing from Gibraltar to there aboard the frigate ' ' HMS Minerve ' ' of 42 guns , under by Captain George Cockburn , accompanied by the frigate ' ' HMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dArcy Preston in substitution of Charles Sawyer , court-martialled for homosexuality , when at 10 pm of December 19 two Spanish frigates were sighted cruising off Cartagena . These frigates were the ' ' Sabina ' ' of 40 guns , flagship of Commodore Don Jacobo Stuart , who was descendant of James II of England , and the ' ' Matilde ' ' , commanded by Miguel Gastn , later commander of the ship of line ' ' San Justo ' ' at Trafalgar . # Battle # The action started at midnight . The ' ' Minerve ' ' engaged the ' ' Sabina ' ' while the ' ' Blanche ' ' , agreeably to Nelson 's directions , began a persecution of the ' ' Matilde ' ' , keeping off the action . The ' ' Sabina ' ' struck her colours after a hard resistance of three hours which was later praised by Nelson in his official letter about the combat . The loss aboard the Spanish frigate amounted to 2 men killed and 48 wounded , although Nelson claimed to have inflicted 164 casualties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and main masts shot through in several places . The ' ' Minerve ' ' , whose masts were , as well as her rigging and sails , much wounded , had 7 men killed and 34 wounded . The first and second lieutenants of the ' ' Minerve ' ' , John Culverhouse and Thomas Masterman Hardy , along with 40 petty-officers and seamen , were put aboard the ' ' Sabina ' ' , which was taken in tow , when at 4 pm the ' ' Matilde ' ' returned to the action and attacked the ' ' Minerve ' ' . After half an hour the ' ' Matilde ' ' retreated damaged , but three other Spanish ships , the ' ' Prncipe de Asturias ' ' of 112 guns , and the frigates ' ' Ceres ' ' of 40 , and ' ' Perla ' ' of 34 guns , hove in sight .

They returned to the ' ' Minerve ' ' at Nelson 's arrival on 9 February . During her departure two days later , the British frigate was pursued by the ' ' Terrible ' ' and the ' ' Neptuno ' ' , another Spanish ship of line . A seaman , William Barnes , perished drowned .

4 owner = Indianapolis Zoo American Bison , is a public sculpture by American wire sculptor William E. Arnold , located in Indianapolis , Indiana within White River State Park . The sculpture is a life-sized male bison constructed of barbed wire , densely coiled and woven . The figure is facing north and stands on a rough limestone block base . It is located on the west end of the Washington Street Bridge at the entrance to the Indianapolis Zoo . It is 5 ' 9 in height , 7 ' 2 in length and 2 ' 2 in width . The barbed wire bison with the limestone pedestal weigh 17 tons . # Description # ' ' American Bison ' ' is a life-sized bison made of intertwining barbed wire that is painted brown . The bison is standing on a jagged limestone base , as if on a cliff ledge . A bronze label on the front of the base reads : THE AMERICAN BISON / SYMBOL OF INB FINANCIAL CORPORATION / WILLIAM E.

4 A funeral procession in the Funeral practices and burial customs in the Philippines encompass a wide range of personal , cultural , and traditional beliefs and practices which Filipinos observe in relation to death , bereavement , and the proper honoring , interment , and remembrance of the dead . These practises have been vastly shaped by the variety of religions and cultures that entered the Philippines throughout its complex history . Most if not all present-day Filipinos , like their ancestors , believe in some form of an afterlife and give considerable attention to honouring the dead . Except amongst Filipino Muslims ( who are obliged to bury a corpse less than 24 hours after death ) , a wake is generally held from three days to a week . Wakes in rural areas are usually held in the home , while in urban settings the dead is typically displayed in a funeral home . Apart from spreading the news about someones death verbally , obituaries are also published in newspapers . Although the majority of the Filipino people are Christians , they have retained some traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # # Wake # When a person dies in the Philippines , Filipino Catholic people , such as the Tagalogs , generally hold a wake known as ' ' lamay ' ' or ' ' paglalamay ' ' , a vigil that typically lasts for five to seven nights , but may last longer if the bereaved are waiting for a relation travelling from afar . During this time , the cleaned and embalmed corpse is placed in a coffin , and displayed at the house of deceased or at a funeral home . The casket is traditionally surrounded by funeral lights , a guest registry book , a contribution box , and flowers . Family members , relatives , and acquaintances participate in the vigil . Apart from offering condolences , mourners and visitors provide financial donations ( called ' ' abuloy ' ' ) to help defray the funeral and burial costs . Food and warm drinks are customarily served by the bereaved during the night vigil , and typical activities conducted outside or near the vigil area include engaging in conversation , singing , guitar playing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is normal that concerned visitors ask the bereaved questions that other cultures deem too sensitive , such as how the decedent died , if he or she suffered , or the cost of hospitalisation or treatment . Such personal questions convey valid affection and concern from guests . Other people also customarily offer masses , novenas , and prayers for the benefit of the deceased . On the funeral day , the coffin is generally loaded into a hearse or borne by family members , relatives , or friends in procession towards the church and later the cemetery . Other mourners follow the hearse during the funeral march . Catholic funerals involve the celebration of the Mass , while Protestant funerals include singing of hymns and recitation of prayers by a minister . The traditional colour worn at memorial services and interments is black , save for the Chinese-Filipino that customarily don white . If white clothing is worn , it is customary to sport a black mourning pin on the breast . Some funerals have men wear the Barong Tagalog and black trousers while sporting a black armband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being formal wear , it is considered appropriate . Women are meanwhile dressed in either black or white , with ladies in more traditional areas also wearing veils and headbands that match their dress . After the entombment , the bereaved offer prayers such as the rosary for the dead every evening for nine days , a custom called the ' ' pasiyam ' ' or ' ' pagsisiyam ' ' ( literally , to do for nine days ) . This novena often concludes with a service followed by formal meal with family and friends . The custom is base on the folk belief that the soul of the departed enters the afterlife on the ninth day . This is followed by a special prayer service or Mass on the fortieth day , evoking the forty days between Christ 's Resurrection and Ascension . The bereavement period extends for a period of one year when another service is held on the first death anniversary , called the ' ' babang luks ' ' ( lit. , descent from mourning ) . # All Souls Day # Catholic and Aglipayan Filipinos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and All Souls ' Day . People gather in graveyards to clean and decorate the family grave as early as All Hallow 's Eve , then offer the dead prayers , candles , flowers and sometimes food . More often than not , mourners keep vigil overnight at graves , eating and making merry to pass the time and keep the dead company . A popular children 's pastime during such vigils is to gather candle wax from melted candles to either play with or sell to candlemakers. # Regional customs # # Luzon # # #Apayao# # The Apayaos , also known as the Isnegs or Isnags , of the Cordillera Administrative Region bury the deceased person under the kitchen area of their homes . # #Benguet# # For eight days , the indigenous people from Benguet blindfold the dead and then sit it on a chair that is placed next to a houses main entrance . The arms and legs are tied together in the sitting position . A ' ' bangil ' ' rite is performed by the elders on the eve of the funeral , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During interment , the departed is directed towards heaven by hitting bamboo sticks together . # #Caviteo # # In rural areas of Cavite , trees are used as burial places . The dying person chooses the tree beforehand , thus when he or she becomes terminally ill or is evidently going to die because old age , a hut is built close to the said tree . The deceased 's corpse is then entombed vertically inside the hollowed-out tree trunk . # #Ilocano# # Filipinos in the Ilocandia have a rich body of funeral and burial traditions , known as the ' ' pompon ' ' or burial rites . # #Wake# # A dead man is prepared by his wife for the wake , known in Ilocano as the ' ' bagongon ' ' . Typically , only the wife will clothe the corpse , believing that the spirit of the dead man can convey messages through her . Also important is the placement of the coffin , which should be in the centre of the house and aligned with the planks of the floorboards . Lighting a wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke is believed to assist the spirit of the dead towards heaven , and it is also kept alight to repel wicked spirits . The ceremonial attire of female mourners for the vigil is black clothing , while their heads and shoulders are covered in a black veil called a ' ' manto ' ' . # #Funeral# # Windows are closed before the casket exits the house , while care is exercised to prevent the casket from touching any part of the house . This is to prevent the deceased 's spirit from loitering and bringing misfortune to the household ; to some Filipinos , a casket hitting any object during a funeral means that another person will die soon . After the burial service , family members wash their hair with a shampoo called ' ' gugu ' ' to remove the influence of the deceased 's spirit . Rice cakes and ' ' basi ' ' are offered to attendees after each prayer session . On the ninth night , the family holds a feast after praying the novena , and does so again after offering prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilongot is buried in a sitting position , and if a woman , has her hands tied to her feet , to prevent her ghost from roaming . # #Itneg# # The Itnegs of Abra have a customary habit of burying their dead under their houses . # #Palaweo# # One of the ancient customs for burying the dead in the Philippines is through the use of burial jars known as ' ' Manunggul jars ' ' . These ancient potteries were found in the Manunggul Cave on the island of Palawan . A characteristic of the jars for the dead is the presence of anthropomorphic human figures on the pot covers . These figures embody souls riding a boat for the dead while seafaring towards their sanctuary in the afterlife . These containers have been dated from 710 BC to 890 BC . There are also figures of boating people steering paddles , wearing headbands , jaw-bands , and persons with hands folded across the chest area . The latter is a method of arranging the remains of the dead . Other similar anthropomorphic jars were also found at Pinol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saranggani Province of the island of Mindanao . These funeral jars dates back from the Metal Age . In addition to these jars , the 1965 archaeological excavations done by Robert Fox at Langen Island in El Nido , Palawan found out that a cave known as Leta-leta Cave was a burial site that dates to the Late Neolithic Period . # #In Sagada# # In Sagada , Mountain Province , the ancient funeral norm of hanging coffins from mountain cliffs is still practiced by some minority groups . The purpose of suspending the casket from the mountain rocks is to bring the deceased closer to heaven . In ancient times , coffins were made from carved and hollowed-out wood . They are ' hung ' in place through the use of projecting beams . # #Tinguian# # For many weeks , the Tinguian people dress the dead body with the best garments , sit it on a chair , and sometimes put a lit tobacco source between the dead persons lips . # The Visayas # # #Cebuano# # Funeral traditions of the Cebuano people also include nine-day recitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers after the burial , additionally chanting the ' ' Pahulayng Dayon ' ' or Eternal Rest ( also known as ' ' Gozos ' ' for the Dead ) . Cebuanos also have superstitious beliefs related to funerals that include : placing funeral alms or ' ' limos ' ' into a container , refraining from sweeping the floor of the deceased 's home ( wastes are collected by hand instead of being swept by brooms ; other Filipinos also have this superstition ) , no bathing and no combing of hair on the part of relatives ( other Filipinos too believe in this ) , placing worn mourning pins into the coffin during interment , preventing tears from dropping onto the glass plate of the casket ( in order for the departed soul to travel in peace ) , placing a chick on top of the coffin of an individual who died due to a transgression ( to hasten justice for the dead victim ) , wearing black or white clothes during the interment ( except for a child who is dressed with a red-colored garment , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , urging relatives to pass through under the casket before it is loaded onto the funeral vehicle ( to assist the surviving relatives in moving on with their life ) , marching the dead towards the church and the cemetery ( known as the ' ' hatod ' ' , or carrying the departed to his destination on foot ) , consuming food only at the cemetery after the interment , and passing through smoke while still within the cemetery or by the gates of the cemetery ( to untangle the spirits of the dead from the bodies of the living ) . # #Ilonggo# # Merriment , singing , and poem recitations are components of funerals in Oton , Iloilo . Gambling is also permitted because gaming contributions help assuage expenses incurred in burying the dead . # Mindanao # # #B'laan# # The B'laan people wrap their dead inside tree bark . The enshrouded corpse is then suspended from treetops. # #Davaoeo# # Customs in Davao City include cutting rosaries that are placed within the hands of the departed ( to prevent a series of deaths ) , placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from reaching coffins ( in case of brutal deaths ) , breaking plates before removing the coffin from any edifice , making children walk under a hoisted coffin before loading the latter onto the hearse , and burning dried leaves or paper and applying the smoke to mourners ' feet before leaving the burial ground . # Other practises # Superstitious beliefs surrounding death entail the sudden appearance of certain animals , particularly those black in colour . Examples are : the appearance of a lingering black butterfly around an individual is an omen that a person 's next of kin has died ; a sick person heading toward hospital who sees a black-hued cat will not survive their condition ; seeing an owl near the home of a sick individual signifies the infirm 's imminent death . Other beliefs pertaining to death are related to dreams , dining etiquette , odours , unusual shapes of certain objects , children , and odd numbers . Examples of these types are : not allowing family members to leave the home until used utensils have been cleansed ( it is believed a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , consuming sour fruit in the evenings ( to avoid early parental demise ) , avoiding taking photographs of three persons together ( to avoid the early death of the individual placed in the middle ) , sudden scent of a burning candle without a lit candle anywhere hints that a relative just died , losing a tooth during a dream is an omen that a relative will soon die , a headless shadow of an individual forewarns that that person will pass away soon , preventing all family members from viewing the face of a dead person at funerals ( to prevent the ghost of the departed from visiting the family resulting in the death of every family member ) , and lifting children related to the deceased over caskets before the entombment ( to hinder the ghost of the dead relative from visiting the children ) . 
4 The Doing Business Report ( DB ) is a study elaborated by the World Bank Group since 2003 every year that is aimed to measure the costs to firms of business regulations in 185 countries in 2013 . The study has become one of the flagship knowledge products of the World Bank Group in the field of private sector development , and is claimed to have motivated the design of several regulatory reforms in developing countries . The study presents every year a detailed analysis of costs , requirements and procedures a specific type of private firm is subject in all countries , and then , creates rankings for every country . The study is also backed up by broad communication efforts , and by creating rankings , the study spotlights countries and leaders that are promoting reforms . The DB has been widely known and used by academics , policy-makers , politicians , development experts , journalists and the business community to highlight red tape and promote reforms . As stated by the IEG study from the World Bank : For country authorities , it sheds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their business climate . For business interests , it has helped to catalyze debates and dialogue about reform . For the World Bank Group , it demonstrates an ability to provide global knowledge , independent of resource transfer and conditionality . The annual exercise generates information that is relevant and useful. . # Contents # In 2012 , the study contains quantitative measures of regulations for starting a business , dealing with construction permits , employing workers , registering property , getting credit , protecting investors , taxes , trading across borders , enforcing contracts , getting an electricity connection and closing a business . As stated in the introduction of the study , A fundamental premise of DB is that economic activity requires good rules . These include rules that establish and clarify property rights and reduce the costs of resolving disputes , rules that increase the predictability of economic interactions and rules that provide contractual partners with core protections against abuse . # Origins # The Doing Business Report has its origins in a paper first published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics by Simeon Djankov , Rafael La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Entry in 2002 . The paper presented data on the regulation of entry of start-up firms in 85 countries covering the number of procedures , official time and official cost that a start-up must bear before it could operate legally . The main findings of the paper were that : Countries with heavier regulation of entry have higher corruption and larger unofficial economies , but no better quality of public or private goods . Countries with more democratic and limited governments have lighter regulation of entry . The paper became widely known because it provided quantitative evidence that entry regulation benefits politicians and bureaucrats without adding value to the private sector , or granting any additional protection . # Methodology # DB is above all , a benchmark study or regulation . The process of gathering data , is first based on a survey of over 8,000 expert contributors ( lawyers , accountants etc. ) in 183 countries who deal with business regulations in their day to day work . The surveys are not a statistical sample , and the results are interpreted and cross-checked for consistency before being included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant government before publication . DB respondents fill out written surveys and provide references to the relevant laws , regulations and fees , based on standardized case scenarios with specific assumptions , such as the business being located in the largest business city of the economy . In most indicators , the case study refers to a small domestically-owned manufacturing company - hence the direct relevance of the indicators to foreign investors and large companies is limited . DB uses a simple averaging approach for weighting sub-indicators and calculating rankings . A detailed explanation of every indicator can be found through the DB website , and a . xls archive that simulates reforms . As stated in the main body of the DB 2010 , some caveats regarding the rankings and main information presented have to be considered by every user of the report . Mainly : * DB does not measure all aspects of the business environment that matter to firm or investors , such as the macroeconomic conditions , or the level of employment , corruption , stability or poverty , in every country . * DB does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , nor the financial system of every country . It also does nt consider the state of the finances of the government of every country . * DB does not cover all the regulation , or all the regulatory requirements . Other types of regulation such as financial market , environment , or intellectual property regulations that are relevant for the private sector are not considered . This is why , the DB is not a complete assessment of competitiveness or of the business environment of a country , and in any case , it should only be considered as a proxy of the regulatory framework faced by the private sector in a specific country . Main Findings According to the DB , regulation does matter for the development of the private sectors , and several reforms are suggested across the report in order to promote the development of the private sector and enable the business environment . Some highlighted findings of the DB are : * Lower barriers to start-up are associated with a smaller informal sector . * Lower costs of entry encourage entrepreneurship , enhance firm productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment opportunities . # Evaluation # Doing Business is a controversial study , with passionate critics and devoted fans . As recognized by the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank , Some have questioned the reliability and objectivity of its measurements . Others doubt the relevance of the issues it addresses or fear it may unduly dominate countries reform agendas at the expense of more crucial development objectives . And the attention given to the indicators may inadvertently signal that the World Bank Group values less burdensome business regulations more highly than its other strategies for poverty reduction and sustainable development . According to Snodgrass , several limitations are present in the DB studies and have to be kept in mind when using the study : * The indicators and measures are referred to the costs , requirements and fees of doing business in the countrys largest business city ; thus conditions elsewhere within the country may differ . * To achieve cross-country standardization respondents are asked to give estimates for a limited liability company of a specific size . Costs for other forms and scales of businesses may differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very specifically defined . The costs of other types of transactions may differ . * The cost estimates come from individuals identified as expert respondents . Sometimes the estimates give by such individual may differ with other experts and with public officials . If so , the responses are cross-checked for consistency . * The estimates assume that a business knows what is required and does not waste time . Satisfying regulatory requirements will obviously take longer if the business lacks information or is unable to follow up promptly . A related point here is that DB may not understand work-arounds , facilitating fees , and learning time that speed or delay approvals and causes variation costs . # Related studies # Published now for nine years , the DB has originated a growing body of research on how performance on DB indicators , and reforms generated by the reports , related to specific development desirable outcomes . As stated by the DB 2010 , about 405 articles have been published in peer-reviewed academic journals and about 1143 working papers are available through Google Scholar . The DB has acknowledged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a ranking valid for all the country . Several regional and sub-national studies have been carried out using the Doing Business methodology to assess variations within countries and regions across different cities , including sub-national studies for countries like Brazil , Mexico and Colombia and regional studies for the Caribbean , the Arab World , Bulgaria and other south eastern European countries . All studies are available from the DB website . DB sometimes unintentionally has been widely used as a study to measure competitiveness . However , regulation rather than competitiveness is the main objective in the DB . Other studies that are also used to measure competitiveness and recognized as business enabling environment ranking systems are the Global Competitiveness Index , the Index of Economic Freedom , and the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor , among others . # Motivating reforms # Several countries have launched reforms to improve their rankings in the DB . These efforts are motivated to a great scope by the fact that the World Bank Group publishes the data , and hence huge coverage by the media and the private sector is usually granted every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out by every country . The World Bank Group has advised over 80 countries on reforms to regulations measured in the DB , providing technical assistance and guidance . Reform advice and DB report production are organizationally separate to avoid conflicts of interest .

He then embarked on a second career as a celebrated voice teacher in both Italy and Japan . Among his notable pupils were tenors Luciano Pavarotti , Giuliano Bernardi , and Vincenzo La Scola and bass Michele Pertusi . He also served as the Artistic Director of the Fujiwara Opera from 1957 to 1965. # Early life and education # Born in Finale Emilia , Pola was the nephew of baritone Toffanetti Ubaldo . He spent most of his youth living in Modena . In 1937 he entered the Orazio Vecchi Conservatory in Modena where he initially studied to be a trumpeter . While there his fine singing voice was discovered and he was persuaded to switch to vocal studies under Mercedes Aicardi . In 1940 , he won , together with the young bass Cesare Siepi and the mezzo-soprano Fedora Barbieri , Italy 's national opera singing contest . Shortly after the competetition win , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years during World War II . He spent much of his time during the war stationed in Gdask in German-occupied Poland . Fortunately , a large portion of his duties were musical ones , and he was able to spend much of his service time playing trumpet and singing in a military band . # Early career in Italy # After his military service ended in 1943 , Pola continued his opera studies with Bertazzoni Barbieri and Leone Magiera . He made his professional opera debut in June 1945 at the Teatro Comunale Modena as Mario Cavaradossi in Giacomo Puccini 's ' ' Tosca ' ' opposite Sara Scuderi in the title role . He returned to that house soon after as Pinkerton in ' ' Madama Butterfly ' ' with Mafalda Favero in the title role , as Alfredo in ' ' La traviata ' ' with Margherita Carosio as Violetta , and as the Duke of Mantua in Giuseppe Verdi 's ' ' Rigoletto ' ' with Tito Gobbi as the title hero . Pola 's career developed rapidly over the next several years , including engagements at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teatro di San Carlo . In 1945 and 1946 he appeared in productions at La Monnaie in Brussels where he was particularly admired as Le Chevalier des Grieux in Jules Massenet 's ' ' Manon ' ' . He made his debut at La Scala in 1947 in the title role of Charles Gounod 's ' ' Faust ' ' with Renata Tebaldi as Marguerite , Cesare Siepi as Mephistopheles , and Antonino Votto conducting . Other notable appearances that Pola made in the late 1940s included the role of Donello in Ottorino Respighi 's ' ' La fiamma ' ' at both the Liceu in Barcelona and the Teatro Coln in Buenos Aires , Maurizio in Francesco Cilea 's ' ' Adriana Lecouvreur ' ' at the Teatro Francesco Cilea in Reggio Calabria with Maria Caniglia in the title role , and appearances at numerous opera houses as Enzo Grimaldi in Amilcare Ponchielli 's ' ' La Gioconda ' ' . # Career in Asia and work as a voice teacher # In the Spring of 1951 Pola sang Alfredo to Maria Callas 's Violetta at the Teatro Regio in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a disliking to Pola which had a negative impact on his career in Italy . In the Summer of 1951 he sang Enzo Grimaldi at the Baths of Caracalla for a gala performance for the Italian government and the official state guest , the President of the Philippines . Pola was invited the next day to an audience with the Filipino President where he was offered a position as the principal tenor at the Manila Opera and a place on the voice faculty at the Manila Conservatory . Given the troubles that Callas was causing for him in Italy , Pola and his wife decided to accept the offer and the family spent the next three years in the Philippines . Among the roles Pola sang with the Manila Opera were Canio in ' ' Pagliacci ' ' , Manrico in ' ' Il trovatore ' ' , Rodolfo in ' ' La bohme ' ' , and Turiddu in ' ' Cavalleria rusticana ' ' among others . In 1954 Pola returned to Italy with the hopes of reviving his opera career in Italy ; an attempt which never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baker named Fernando Pavarotti who wanted to know whether the tenor voice of his 19-year-old son , Luciano , was good enough for training as a professional opera singer . Pola later reported that he knew after an approximately 15-minute audition that he was standing against a super talent . He decided spontaneously to help the boy and his family , who did n't have much money , by giving Luciano daily voice lessons free of charge . For the next three years , Luciano studied with Pola almost every day . Pavarotti later stated , Were it not for my dear teacher Arrigo Pola , I would not be what I am today . In 1957 Pola was offered a position on the voice faculty at the Tokyo University of the Arts and the post of Artistic Director of the Fujiwara Opera with the condition that he mastered the Japanese language . He accepted the offer and moved to Japan after securing Pavarotti 's further training with Ettore Campogalliani . Pavarotti continued to be mentored by Pola through visits to Tokyo while studying with Campogalliani . Pola eventually became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University . He also continued to perform in operas and concerts in Japan and China .

Some of his other notable pupils included Riccarda Bassi , Peter Butterfield , Andrea Coronella , Nikolay Dorozhkin , Thirry Flix , Rudy Giovannini , Reinaldo Macias , David Mannell , Michi Nakamaru , Jacek Pazola , Luana Pellegrineschi , and Manrico Tedeschi . He died in Modena at the age of 80 . At a birthday party shortly before his death , he commented to a visiting Canadian college president that one of his birthday guests , a former Welsh pupil named Eileen Dillon , could have been the best in the world , if she was n't so obsessed with charity .

4 Point Lonsdale Lighthouse , also known as the Point Lonsdale Signal Station , is close to the township of Point Lonsdale in the Borough of Queenscliffe , Victoria , Australia . It stands at the eastern end of the Bellarine Peninsula , on the western side of the entrance to Port Phillip from Bass Strait , on a headland overlooking the Rip , a stretch of water considered one of the ten most treacherous navigable passages in the world , and the only seaborne approach to Melbourne . It is operated by the Victorian Channels Authority , part of the Port of Melbourne Corporation . # Description # The lighthouse was designed by the Victorian Public Works Department and erected by the contractors Coates Brothers . It is of a traditional design consisting of a cylindrical tower and capital , similar to many late nineteenth century Victorian lighthouses , such as the earlier Point Hicks Lighthouse . It is built of reinforced concrete and surmounted by a Chance Brothers lantern . The original oil lamp of the light was first replaced with an acetylene light and later an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-storey , brick signal station and observation room . Halfway up the tower is a cantilevered platform supporting red and green navigation lights . # History # The first navigation aid at Point Lonsdale was a signal station erected in 1852 . In 1856 a red pillar beacon was built . In 1863 the original Queenscliff Low Light , a prefabricated wooden structure , was re-erected at Point Lonsdale and painted with distinctive black and red bands . It used a temporary light until a permanent light was lit in 1867 . It was replaced by the current concrete tower in 1902 , with the wooden tower dismantled and cut up for firewood in 1912 . Responsibility for the light passed in 1915 from the state of Victoria to Commonwealth control . It was handed back in 1934 with the lighthouse classified as a Harbour Entrance Light rather than a Coastal Highway Light . The signal station and observation room were added to the base of the tower in 1950 . Although the light was automated in 1999 , the signal station continues to be staffed 24 hours a day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and inside Port Phillip Heads , making it possibly the last manned lighthouse in Australia . # Heritage values # The Point Lonsdale Lighthouse precinct contains not only the lighthouse itself , but other buildings associated with lighthouse operations and navigation , as well as nearby military defence structures built during the First and Second World Wars . The whole precinct is considered to be of architectural , historical and archaeological significance to the State of Victoria , and has been listed by Heritage Victoria with the Victorian Heritage Database number H1517 . It is of historical significance because of its association with the maritime and defence history of the state . The lighthouse structures in the precinct show the importance of navigational aids at a time when shipping was vitally important in maintaining trade between Victorian ports and the rest of the world . The lighthouse was the first guiding light to the entrance of Port Phillip visible from the sea . The defence structures reflect the importance of the defence of Port Phillip and its major cities of Melbourne and Geelong during the two World Wars . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1884 and an explosives shed ( later used as a rocket shed ) built in 1891 , are of architectural significance . The lighthouse is a typical and aesthetically pleasing example of an early 20th-century lighthouse design . The foghorn shed is the only one known from a Victorian lighthouse , and the two vertical boilers which power the steam operated foghorns are rare in their original setting . The precinct is of archaeological significance for its potential to reveal artefactual remains pertaining to the use of the site as a lightstation and signal station . # The lighthouse today # The lighthouses exterior was restored in 1997 and , in 2002 , Heritage Victoria and the Victorian Channels Authority cooperated to restore the interior . Celebrations of the structure 's centenary were held on 23 March 2002 . It contains a restored foghorn which is operated in foggy weather , giving a double blast every 30 seconds . There is public access to the area around the tower . Organised tours of the tower are conducted on Sundays by the Queenscliffe Maritime Museum .

4 Stefan Meyer ( 27 April 1872 29 December 1949 ) was an Austrian physicist involved in research on radioactivity . He became director of the Institute for Radium Research in Vienna and received the Lieben Prize in 1913 for his research on radium . He was the brother of Hans Leopold Meyer who was also awarded the Lieben Prize . # Life and work # Stefan was the second son of Jewish parents : a lawyer and notary Gotthelf Karl Meyer and his wife Clara ( ne Goldschmidt , sister of Victor Goldschmidt ) . He went to school in Vienna and later graduated from gymnasium in Horn in 1892 . He studied physics at the University of Vienna and attended the University of Leipzig for one year . He obtained his PhD in 1896 for work with Franz Serafin Exner and completed his habilitation in 1900 . In 1897 , Meyer became assistant of Ludwig Boltzmann at the Institute for Theoretical Physics , University of Vienna . His research was dedicated to magnetic permeability of liquids . After a talk of Friedrich Oskar Giesel a pioneer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radium from Giesel to determine magnetic properties of the new element . Meyer and his colleague Egon von Schweidler were able to show that the Becquerel rays ( beta rays ) could be deflected by magnetic fields ; this effect was discovered simultaneously by several scientists , but Meyer ' ' et al . ' ' also showed that the radiation from polonium ( alpha rays ) behaved differently in the magnetic field . Meyer was able to organize the production of 4 grams of radium , as recommended in 1901 by the Austrian Academy of Sciences . The chemical plant of Auer von Welsbach , which was used to produce rare earth elements , provided the necessary technical equipment and knowledge for separation of small quantities of material from ore . Meyer became interim head of the institute for one year after the suicide of Boltzmann . During that time , Meyer had also contacted Lise Meitner before she left for Berlin in 1907 .

In 1910 , the Institute for Radium Research in Vienna was opened . Meyer became its first acting director , and Exner was the director of the institute . The institute in Vienna opened two years before the Institute du Radium in Paris . During the time when Meyer was acting director , a number of prominent scientists worked at the institute , including George de Hevesy , Victor Francis Hess and Friedrich Paneth . With the Anschluss sterreichs in 1938 , the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany , Meyer as a Jew had to leave office . He requested retirement before he was forced out of the institute .

This book became a standard German textbook on radioactivity similar to the book of Curie in French and the book of Rutherford in English .

4 In mathematical analysis , a Pompeiu derivative is a real-valued function of one real variable that is the derivative of an everywhere differentiable function and that vanishes in a dense set . In particular , a Pompeiu derivative is discontinuous at any point where it is not 0 . Whether non-identically zero such functions may exist was a problem that arose in the context of early-1900s research on functional differentiability and integrability . The question was affirmatively answered by Dimitrie Pompeiu by constructing an explicit example ; these functions are therefore named after him . # Pompeiu 's construction # Pompeiu 's construction is described here . Let <math> sqrt3x </math> denote the real cubic root of the real number <math> x . </math> Let <math> qjjin N </math> be an enumeration of the rational numbers in the unit interval <math> 0 , , 1 . </math> Let <math> ajjin N </math> be positive real numbers with <math> textstylesumj aj **16;473; Define , for all <math> xin 0 , , 1 </math> : <math> g(x) : =sumj=0infty , aj sqrt3x-qj . </math> Since for any <math> xin0 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than or equal to ' ' a ' ' <sub> j </sub> in absolute value , the series uniformly converges to a continuous , strictly increasing function g(x) , due to the Weierstrass M-test . Moreover , it turns out that the function ' ' g ' ' is differentiable , with : <math> gprime(x) : =frac13sumj=0infty fracajsqrt3(x-qj)20 , </math> at any point where the sum is finite ; also , at all other points , in particular , at any of the <math> qj , </math> one has <math> textstyle gprime(x) : =+infty . </math> Since the image of <math> g </math> is a closed bounded interval with left endpoint <math> 0=g(0) , </math> up to a multiplicative constant factor one can assume that ' ' g ' ' maps the interval <math> 0 , , 1 </math> onto itself . Since ' ' g ' ' is strictly increasing , it is a homeomorphism ; and by the theorem of differentiation of the inverse function , its composition inverse <math> f , : =g-1 </math> has a finite derivative at any point , which vanishes at least in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of <math> 0 , , 1 </math> ( actually , it vanishes in many other points ; see below ) . # Properties # * It is known that the zero-set of a derivative of any everywhere differentiable function is a ' ' G ' ' <sub> </sub> subset of the real line . By definition , for any Pompeiu function this set is a ' ' dense ' ' G <sub> </sub> set , therefore by the Baire category theorem it is a residual set . In particular , it possesses uncountably many points . * A linear combination ' ' af ' ' ( ' ' x ' ' ) + ' ' bg ' ' ( ' ' x ' ' ) of Pompeiu functions is a derivative , and vanishes on the set ' ' f ' ' = 0 ' ' g ' ' = 0 , which is a dense ' ' G ' ' <sub> </sub> by the Baire category theorem . Thus , Pompeiu functions are a vector space of functions . * A limit function of a uniformly convergent sequence of Pompeiu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a derivative , due to the theorem of limit under the sign of derivative . Moreover , it vanishes in the intersection of the zero sets of the functions of the sequences : since these are dense ' ' G ' ' <sub> </sub> sets , the zero set of the limit function is also dense . * As a consequence , the class ' ' E ' ' of all bounded Pompeiu derivatives on an interval ' ' a ' ' , ' ' b ' ' is a ' ' closed ' ' linear subspace of the Banach space of all bounded functions under the uniform distance ( hence , it is a Banach space ) . *Pompeiu 's above construction of a ' ' positive ' ' function is a rather peculiar example of a Pompeiu 's function : a theorem of Weil states that ' ' generically ' ' a Pompeiu derivative assumes both positive and negative values in dense sets , in the precise meaning that such functions constitute a residual set of the Banach space ' ' E ' ' .

4 : ' ' This is an article on Mithraism in comparative mythology and comparative theology . See Mithraic mysteries for the main article . ' ' The Roman cult of Mithras had connections with other pagan deities , Syncretism being a prominent feature of Roman paganism . Almost all Mithraea contain statues dedicated to gods of other cults , and it is common to find inscriptions dedicated to Mithras in other sanctuaries , especially those of Jupiter Dolichenus . Mithraism was not an alternative to other pagan religions , but rather a particular way of practising pagan worship ; and many Mithraic initiates can also be found worshipping in the civic religion , and as initiates of other mystery cults . However , in popular culture and especially among the New Atheist movement , the most widely discussed element of Mithras in the context of comparative religion is his relationship with Christianity . Connections with the figure of Jesus himself have even been posited but are generally ignored by scholars . More widely discussed are a few apparent similarities between early Christian liturgical practice and the Mithraic rites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have been subject to varying interpretations over time . # Comparisons with contemporary Roman gods # # Phanes # Orphic speculation influenced the cult of Mithras at times . In Orphism , Phanes emerged from the world egg at the beginning of time , bringing the universe into existence . There is some literary evidence of the syncretism of Mithras and Phanes . A list of the eight elements of creation appears in Zenobius and Theon of Smyrna ; most of the elements are the same , but in Zenobius the seventh element is ' Mithras ' , in Theon it is ' Phanes ' . A Greek inscription on a statue base from a Mithraeum in Rome reads to Deus Sol Mithras Phanes . A relief from Vercovium ( Housesteads ) on Hadrian 's Wall shows Mithras emerging from the cosmic egg , which is represented both as such and by the shape of the zodiacal ring . Ulansey adds : : The identification between Mithras and Phanes indicated by CIMRM 860 is also explicitly attested by an inscription found in Rome dedicated to ' **26;31768;TOOLONG ' and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in Modena . This shows Phanes coming from an egg with flames shooting out around him , surrounded by the twelve signs of the zodiac , in an image very similar to that at Newcastle . Further references also exist . # Sol Invictus # Mithras is given the title deus sol invictus ( unconquered sun god ) in several inscriptions . The vagueness of the term ' ' invictus ' ' means that it was widely used . Mithraism never became a state cult , however , unlike the official late Roman Sol Invictus cult . # Jupiter Dolichenus # The Mithraea at Carnuntum appear to have been constructed in close association with contemporary temple of Jupiter Dolichenus , and there seem to have been considerable similarities between the two cults ; both being mystery cults with secret liturgies , both being popular in the military , and having similar names for their officials and intitiates . Two large Mithrea have been discovered in Doliche itself ( modern Gaziantep in Turkey ) , which have been proposed as being unusually early . # Helios/Sol # Although Mithras himself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he and Sol appear in several scenes as separate persons , with the banquet scene being the most prominent example . Other scenes feature Mithras ascending behind Sol in the latter 's chariot , the deities shaking hands and the two gods at an altar with pieces of meat on a spit or spits . One peculiar scene shows Sol kneeling before Mithras , who holds an object , interpreted either as a Persian cap or the haunch of the bull , in his hand . # Mithraism and Christianity # The idea of a relationship between early Christianity and Mithraism is based on a remark in the 2nd-century Christian writer Justin Martyr , who accused the Mithraists of diabolically imitating the Christian communion rite . Based upon this statement , Ernest Renan in 1882 set forth a vivid depiction of two rival religions : if the growth of Christianity had been arrested by some mortal malady , the world would have been Mithraic . Edwin M. Yamauchi questions the validity of Renan 's inference , which , published nearly 150 years ago , has no value as a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars , among them Ronald Nash and Edwin Yamauchi , have suggested a different interpretation of Mithraism 's relationship to Christianity . Yamauchi , pointing out that most of the textual evidence for Mithraist doctrine was written after the New Testament was in broad circulation , posits that it is more likely that Mithraism borrowed from Christianity than the other way around . The philosopher Celsus in the second century provides some evidence that Ophite gnostic ideas were influencing the mysteries of Mithras. # Virgin birth # It is sometimes said that the birth of Mithras was a virgin birth , like that of Jesus . Anahita was said to have conceived the Mithras from the seed of Zarathustra preserved in the waters of Lake Hamun in the Persian province of Sistan . In other , contradictory traditions , he is also born without any sex but from the rock wall of a cave . One must know that there were separate Mithra traditions that may have changed and been adapted over time . This information comes from a Temple that bears this inscription dedicated to Anahita and dated to about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief derived from the Perseus myths , which held he was born from an underground cavern . # 25th of December # It is often stated that Mithras was thought to have been born on December 25 . But Beck states that this is not the case . In fact he calls this assertion that hoariest of ' facts ' . He continues : In truth , the only evidence for it is the celebration of the birthday of Invictus on that date in Calendar of Philocalus . ' ' Invictus ' ' is of course ' ' Sol Invictus ' ' , Aurelian 's sun god . It does not follow that a different , earlier , and unofficial sun god , ' ' Sol Invictus Mithras ' ' , was necessarily or even probably , born on that day too . Unusually amongst Roman mystery cults , the mysteries of Mithras had no ' public ' face ; worship of Mithras was confined to initiates , and they could only undertake such worship in the secrecy of the Mithraeum . Clauss states : the Mithraic Mysteries had no public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natalis Invicti ' ' Birth of the Unconquerable ( Sun ) , held on 25 December , was a general festival of the Sun , and by no means specific to the Mysteries of Mithras . . Steven Hijmans has discussed in detail the question of whether the general ' ' natalis Invicti ' ' festival was related to Christmas but does not give Mithras as a possible source . # Salvation # A painted text on the wall of the St. Prisca Mithraeum ( c A.D. 200 ) in Rome contains the words : ' ' et nos servasti ( ? ) . . . sanguine fuso ' ' ( ' ' and you have saved us .. in the shed blood ' ' ) . The meaning of this text is unclear , although presumably it refers to the bull killed by Mithras , as no other source refers to a Mithraic salvation . However the ' ' servasti ' ' is only a conjecture . According to Robert Turcan , Mithraic salvation had little to do with the other-worldly destiny of individual souls , but was on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the good creation against the forces of evil . # Symbolism of water # Monuments in the Danube area depict Mithras firing a bow at a rock in the presence of the torch-bearers , apparently to encourage water to come forth . Clauss states that , after the ritual meal , this water-miracle offers the clearest parallel with Christianity . # Sign of the cross # Tertullian states that followers of Mithras were marked on their forehead in an unspecified manner . There is no indication that this mark was made in the form of a cross , or a branding , or a tattoo , or a permanent mark of any kind . The symbol of a circle with a diagonal cross inscribed within it is commonly found in Mithraea , especially in association with the Leontocephaline figure . # Mithraic motifs and medieval Christian art # From the end of the 18th century some scholars have suggested that certain elements in medieval Christian art reflect images found in Mithraic reliefs . Franz Cumont was among these scholars , although he studied each motif in isolation rather than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian church over paganism , artists continued to make use of stock images originally devised for Mithras in order to depict the new and unfamiliar stories of the bible . The stranglehold of the workshop meant that the first Christian artworks were heavily based on pagan art , and a few alterations in costume and attitude transformed a pagan scene into a Christian picture . A series of scholars have since discussed possible similarities with Mithraic reliefs in medieval Romanesque art . Vermaseren stated that the only certain example of such influence was an image of Elijah drawn up to heaven in a chariot drawn by fiery horses . Deman stated that to compare isolated elements was not useful , and that combinations should be studied . He also pointed out that a similarity of image does not tell us whether this implies an ideological influence , or merely a tradition of craftmanship . He then gave a list of medieval reliefs that parallel Mithraic images , but refused to draw conclusions from such parallels , since these would be subjective .

4 Skanderbeg 's Italian expedition ( 14601462 ) was undertaken to aid his ally Ferdinand I of Naples , whose rulership was threatened by the Angevin Dynasty . George Kastrioti Skanderbeg was the ruler of Albania ( ) who had been leading a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire since 1443 and allied himself with several Western European monarchs in order to consolidate his domains . In 1458 , Alfonso V of Aragon , ruler of Sicily and Naples and Skanderbeg 's most important ally , died , leaving his illegitimate son , Ferdinand , on the Neapolitan throne ; Ren d'Anjou , the French Duke of Anjou , laid claim to the throne . The conflict between Ren 's and Ferdinand 's supporters soon erupted into a civil war . Pope Calixtus III , of Spanish background himself , could do little to secure Ferdinand , so he turned to Skanderbeg for aid . In 1457 , Skanderbeg had achieved his most famous victory over the Ottoman Empire at Albulena ( Ujbardha ) , which was received with great enthusiasm throughout Italy . In order to repay Alfonso for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Skanderbeg took up the pope 's pleas to help out Alfonso 's son by sending a military expedition to Italy . Before leaving , Skanderbeg tried to negotiate a ceasefire with Sultan Mehmed II , the conqueror of Constantinople , to ensure his domain 's safety . Mehmed had not declared a truce and he was still sending his armies against Bosnia and the Morea . It was not until 1459 , after Mehmed 's conquest of Serbia , that Mehmed not only declared a truce , but also a three-year ceasefire with Skanderbeg . This gave Skanderbeg his opportunity to send his men to Italy . Due to fears of an approaching Ottoman army , Skanderbeg first sent his nephew , Constantine , with 500 cavalry to Barletta . They were incorporated into Ferdinand 's forces to combat his Angevin rivals . They held back their enemy for a year , but did not gain much ground until Skanderbeg arrived in September 1461 . Before reaching Italy , Skanderbeg visited Ragusa ( Dubrovnik ) to convince its rectors to help fund his campaign . Meanwhile , his men landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upon arriving , Skanderbeg continued to pursue his ally 's enemies with great success . Ferdinand 's adversaries thus began to retreat from his territories and Skanderbeg went back to Albania ; a troop of his men stayed until Ferdinand managed to finally defeat the pretenders to his throne at the Battle of Orsara , although it is not known if Skanderbeg 's men participated . # Background # In 1456 , Skanderbeg 's ally , Janos Hunyadi , died , and his son , Mathias Corvinus , was crowned King of Hungary . Hunyadi had been an advocate for an offensive war against the Ottoman Empire , whereas the Hungarian nobility and his son promoted a defensive war . The next year , however , George Kastrioti Skanderbeg defeated a sizable Ottoman force at the Battle of Albulena ( Ujbardha ) . Rome had been desperately waiting for such a victory after the Siege of Belgrade , as Pope Calixtus III had wanted to assure himself of the feasibility of a crusade before declaring one . Calixtus thus named Skanderbeg the Captain-General of the Curia ; to secure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war that had been captured at Albulena to Rome . Despite seeing his forces defeated the year before , Sultan Mehmed II prepared another force to be sent into Albania . The country had been obstructing his ambitions for empire in the West and he grew restless to defeat Skanderbeg . Skanderbeg sent delegations to several Western European states to convince them to stop fighting each other and unite for Calixtus ' crusade . # Italian situation # On 27 September 1458 , Alfonso V of Aragon , Skanderbeg 's most important and helpful ally after the stipulation of the Treaty of Gaeta , died . In 1448 , as gesture of friendship with Alfonso , Skanderbeg sent a detachment of Albanian troops commanded by General Demetrios Reres to Crotone to quell a rebellion against Alfonso . The next year , many of these men were allowed to settle four villages in Sicily which Alfonso controlled . Upon hearing of his ally 's death , Skanderbeg sent emissaries to the new King of Naples , Ferdinand I , to give condolence for his father 's death , but also to congratulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The succession was not without turbulence , however : Ren d'Anjou laid claim to the throne since his family had controlled Naples before Aragon had taken control of it , and also because Ferdinand was Alfonso 's illegitimate son . The Southern Italian nobility , many of Angevin background , supported Ren d'Anjou over the Aragonese Ferdinand . Among them was Giovanni Antonio del Balzo Orsini , the Prince of Taranto , and Jacopo Piccinino , a famed ' ' condottieri ' ' who had been invited by the Angevins . Francisco Sforza , the Duke of Milan , who was wary of a French presence in Italy , sided with Ferdinand and sent his nephew , Alessandro Sforza , to command his army in southern Italy . Pope Calixtus , a Spaniard who wished to see his compatriot in control of Naples , was in no position to help the weak Ferdinand , so he turned to Skanderbeg for help . However , by that time , Piccinino and his men had conquered all of southern Italy except Naples , Capua , Aversa , Gaeta , Troia , and Barletta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid from Ferdinand 's father , Alfonso , and was still a vassal of the Crown of Aragon , so he felt the need to repay the Crown . He accepted the pope 's pleas to go to Italy and aid Ferdinand . Skanderbeg 's stated reasoning was twofold : he wanted to remain loyal to his ally and he wanted to prevent an Angevin takeover of Naples since they had maintained friendly relations with the Turks . Skanderbeg also feared that if the Angevins took Naples , they would turn to Albania where they had previously maintained a kingdom . On the other hand , before undertaking any action against the Angevins , he took measures to soften relations with Venice . Seeing that Southern Italy was locked in conflict , Venice no longer feared an Aragonese-Albanian alliance and the Senate decided to take a friendlier approach in Albanian-Venetian relations . Meanwhile , Pope Calixtus III had died and was succeeded by Pope Pius II . Sensing that war would soon begin , Pius tried to convince Giovanni Orsini , Ferdinand 's main rival , to settle his differences with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took up the Angevin stance and , in the hopes of convincing Pius to allow the French takeover of Naples , proposed the repeal of the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges which undermined the pope 's power and he even declared that he would be willing to lend 70,000 men for the planned papal crusade . Pius , however , was wary of insincerity and disregarded these proposals . A further effort to deter Skanderbeg 's landing was made by Sigismondo Malatesta , the Lord of Rimini and Italy 's most feared petty tyrant , who had tried to invite Mehmed to Italy with a detailed map of the Adriatic if Ferdinand sent for the Albanian . The manuscript , however , never reached the sultan and fell into Pius ' hands . # Albanian situation # Constant news of Ottoman campaigns against Bosnia and Morea but not against Albania seemed to suggest to Skanderbeg that Mehmed II had been considering an armistice with Skanderbeg . The latter took advantage of this lull in the fighting by preparing for his voyage to Italy and by securing his northern frontiers from a possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lek Dukagjini , who had been trying to expand his realm by reaching an agreement with the Turks . In order to curb his ambitions , Skanderbeg seized Shat Fortress and presented it as a gift to Venice . Skanderbeg then established an alliance with Venice against Dukagjini , while Dukagjni was strengthening his Turkish alliance . The new pope issued a bull against Dukagjini , giving him fifteen days to break his alliance with the Ottomans and to reconcile with Skanderbeg , or be subject to interdiction ; Dukagjini conceded and chose the former option . He then reestablished his alliance with Skanderbeg and Venice and accepted all of its losses . Pius II continued to support Skanderbeg , but did not provide him as much financial aid as Calixtus had since he believed that Skanderbeg 's military skill and his soldiers ' aptitude for battle were enough to hold back the Turkish armies . However , the pope still considered Skanderbeg 's assistance essential for his plans for an anti-Ottoman crusade . In 1459 , after Mehmed II completed his conquest of Serbia , Ottoman envoys appealed for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sultan 's purpose was to distance Skanderbeg from the pope 's crusade as he believed the crusade 's only hope for success was Skanderbeg . In order to give Albania a break from fifteen years of continuous Ottoman invasion , Skanderbeg considered accepting the proposal but he had to get the pope 's approval . Pius did not allow such an agreement and began to doubt Skanderbeg 's loyalty . As the Ottomans were operating in the Western Balkans , Pius feared that the Ottoman soldiers would break the truce and pour into Albania . In order to regain the pope 's trust , Skanderbeg did not agree to the peace . Skanderbeg , nevertheless , was disappointed by Rome 's response and he responded by not participating in the Council of Mantua which was held to plan the future crusade . The Council ended in failure , signifying that Skanderbeg would receive no help from the West . He thus sent ambassadors to the pope saying that he would only be willing to land in Italy if a ceasefire with the Turks were arranged , something which Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ragusa ( Dubrovnik ) was to receive Skanderbeg 's envoy on 9 June 1460 . He requested the city 's support for the transport of his warriors to southern Italy over the Adriatic . Venice was not consulted since they pursued their own interests in Italy , whereas Ragusa held close economic relations with the Crown of Aragon . Meanwhile , Skanderbeg sent Martin Muzaka to Rome where he presented Pius with Skanderbeg 's plans , and Pius in turn notified Ferdinand . Pius then ordered Venice to guard the Albanian coastline . Skanderbeg then decided to send a troop of his men while he remained in Albania . In mid-June 1461 , Skanderbeg agreed to a ceasefire with Mehmed who used this time to finally conquer Trebizond ( Trabzon ) in the northeastern part of modern Turkey . The truce was agreed to last for three years . # First landings # On 17 September 1460 , Skanderbeg sent 500 cavalry to Barletta in Apulia under the command of his nephew , Constantine , who at the time was 22 or 23 years old . The battles for the Crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much more than one-thousand troops per belligerent . Ferdinand 's Neapolitan army as a whole stood at 7,000 men . The addition of 500 Albanian cavalry , even though they were not cuirassed like their Italian counterparts , increased his force 's effectiveness . By this time , Ferdinand had lost most of his territory , and was left with some fortresses in Apulia and the area surrounding Naples . The Angevins were swiftly approaching Naples and Ferdinand prepared a counteroffensive . He first secured what he had by putting Roberto del Balzo Orsini in command , but Orsini 's incompetence held up the Neapolitan army . By this time , Skanderbeg 's men had already arrived , and Ferdinand commenced his offensive . Albanian light-cavalry warfare was first noted here for its swiftness and effectiveness where they were reported to travel 30-40 mi per day as opposed to the Italian cavalry which could only travel 10-12 mi . The Albanians were encouraged by Ferdinand to fight in their traditional manner and to raid the territory ; Ferdinand informed Francisco Sforza that the Albanians had been devastating Apulia and taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prompted Giovanni Orsini to try to stop Skanderbeg from pouring his men into Italy . Ren d'Anjou had been particularly surprised by Skanderbeg 's action since he believed that he had never offended the Albanian . # OrsiniSkanderbeg correspondence # Giovanni Orsini was the Prince of Taranto and Ferdinand 's fiercest rival . He had been , however , Alfonso 's faithful ally and had developed an admiration for Skanderbeg and his campaigns in Albania . After Skanderbeg had sided with his rival , Orsini allied with the Angevins and refused to recognize Ferdinand as King of Naples . He then sent a letter to convince Skanderbeg to pull his men out of Italy arguing that Ferdinand 's fortunes were hopeless , that Skanderbeg 's fame would die out after his supposed debacle , and that an alliance with Ren would be much more rewarding than an alliance with Ferdinand . Skanderbeg 's letter in response , dated to 10 October 1460 , stated that he was not a ' ' condottieri ' ' looking for fortune , but a mature man looking to help his ally . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another letter was sent to Pius assuring him that the Albanians were fit for battle in Italy , something the Italian rulers did not believe . The letters elucidate Skanderbeg 's political motives behind his Italian expedition , presenting himself as a noble ally , and also illustrate the influence of the Renaissance in Skanderbeg 's court . They also served a psychological purpose to intimidate Ferdinand 's rivals : Skanderbeg compared himself to Pyrrhus of Epirus of antiquity who marched into Italy to defend the Greek city-states from Roman expansion . # Neapolitan counteroffensive # By October 1460 , Ferdinand was able to recapture his western territories from Capua to Beneventum . In his eastern frontier , however , his enemies remained at large . The most dangerous among them was Piccinino . Piccinino had undertaken the task of blocking papal and Neapolitan troops en route to Apulia . Since Roberto Orsini , the man left in charge of the east and Giovanni Orsini 's brother who had remained loyal to Ferdinand , was deemed incompetent , Ferdinand invited Constantine to Naples , offering him a leading role in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Francesco del Balzo , the Duke of Andria who had remained loyal to Ferdinand , managed to defeat Ercole d'Este in Gargano . They then had control over the custom-duties gathered there which brought 30,000 ducats annually from which most of Piccinino 's pay came . The fighting continued for three months after which Constantine and Ferdinand were able to regain some lost territory . Piccinino prepared his own counteroffensive , along with Giovanni Orsini 's men , laying siege to the main castles . A fierce battle soon erupted over Venosa on 28 May 1461 where the Albanian cavalry took part . Ferdinand abandoned the city and fled back to Apulia . Near Troia , he met Skanderbeg 's ambassador , Gjok Stres Balsha , who informed him that Skanderbeg was ready to land in Italy as soon as the proper galleys were provided . # Skanderbeg 's expedition # # Preparations and Ragusan voyage # Before leaving for Italy , Skanderbeg needed to accumulate the appropriate finances . Pius ordered the Diocese of Dalmatia to give a third of what it had raised for the forthcoming crusade to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to Skanderbeg from the Vatican 's funds . The Ragusan banks held this amount , but due to the threat of an Ottoman invasion , they refused to continue funding the crusade ; Stefan Vuki of Zeta warned that the Ottomans would soon move into Dalmatia and Albania . They were thus reluctant to fund Skanderbeg 's expedition to Italy . Due to issues of finance and the lack of large ships ( he had , however , received several smaller ships to transport his troops ) , Skanderbeg 's arrival was delayed while Ferdinand was under siege in Barletta . Before the siege began , however , Ferndinand sent four galleys to the Albanian shores where Skanderbeg and his men were waiting . Skanderbeg had meanwhile sent an unnamed captain to his eastern frontiers to guard against an Ottoman attack and left his wife , Donika , in charge of his affairs . A Venetian ambassador on his way from Constantinople reported that Skanderbeg had assembled 1,000 cavalry and 2,000 infantry along with several papal and Neapolitan ships at ' ' Capo-di-Lachi ' ' ( ) near modern-day Kavaj @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Neapolitan ships , however , so he continued to wait . On 2122 August 1461 , the four galleys sent by Ferdinand arrived . He boarded soon thereafter but he did not send his entire force directly to Apulia . He sent Gjok Balsha ( who had returned from Italy ) with 500 cavalry and 1,000 infantry to the besieged Ferdinand , whereas Skanderbeg himself went to Ragusa to convince its rectors there to give him his needed funds . Balsha 's men landed in Barletta on 24 August 1461 . The Angevin forces , among whom was Giovanni Orsini , feared that Skanderbeg himself was the leader of this force , so they lifted the siege of Barletta immediately . Balsha then informed Ferdinand that Skanderbeg would arrive after his voyage to Ragusa . Ferdinand felt that Skanderbeg 's personal involvement was essential and began to worry when he did not come in two days , as Balsha had promised . Skanderbeg reached Ragusa on 24 August 1461 along with the Pal Engjlli , the Archbishop of Durrs . His men stayed on the ships anchored in the harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure , the Ragusans had reconsidered Skanderbeg 's requests . His fame was visible when he walked through the city-gates and the population poured into the streets to see him . He had been greeted with a ceremony and a tour of the city inspecting its walls and weaponry . He then received the financial sum he had come for . His men were also supplied with food for their coming campaign . His popularity allowed him to be well-kept by the Ragusans where the largest Albanian community outside of Albania was present . On 29 August 1461 , Skanderbeg set off for Apulia , but a storm forced him to anchor off a Dalmatian island . On 3 September 1461 , Skanderbeg finally reached Barletta. # Skanderbeg in Italy # Even though they lifted the siege of Barletta upon seeing Skanderbeg 's approaching men the week before , Angevin forces remained active . Once Skanderbeg arrived , Ferdinand put him in command of the fortress of Barletta whereas the King himself went to Ariano Irpino . Once left in command of the fortress , Skanderbeg moved against Ferdinand 's rivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Duke of Calabria ) , Piccinino , and Francesco del Balzo . They had stationed themselves in Andria , where the Albanian assaults continued . The Albanian cavalry 's light armament , swift horses and loose ranks allowed them to quickly overcome the more heavily armed Italian cavalry , which fought in tight formations . In one of their operations , an Albanian warrior captured Alois Minutulo , the lord of the Castle of Monte Sant'Angelo who was imprisoned in the Fortress of Barletta . Three years later , Ferdinand would present Skanderbeg with the castle as a token of his gratitude . Ferdinand 's opponents , under Piccinino 's main command , tried to open battle with Skanderbeg , but due to the combined strength of Albanian and Neapolitan forces , they withdrew from the Andrian fields to Acquaviva delle Fonti . News of Piccinino 's retreat reached Venice who sent a message to Francisco Sforza . Skanderbeg then marched to Taranto , where Giovanni Orsini was prince . Orsini tried again to dissuade Skanderbeg from marching against him , but Ferdinand was wary of Orsini 's faithfulness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his army into three parts , one under Moisi Arianit Golemi , the other under Vladan Gjurica , and the last under his command . He led attacks against Ferdinand 's enemies in three directions without halt , thoroughly exhausting them . During the month of October , Skanderbeg continued to pillage Orisini 's territory from his bases at Barletta and Andria since the Angevins were not present ; Ferdinand meanwhile mopped up in Calabria , where he recaptured Cosenza and Castrovillari . At this point , Orsini asked Skanderbeg for a truce which the Albanian rejected . On 27 October , Skanderbeg reported that he had captured the town of Gisualdo . Piccinino then asked Skanderbeg to discontinue his campaign which Skanderbeg exuberantly accepted , believing that peace was near . Piccinino , however , did not seek to maintain the agreement as one of his deserters reported . Upon learning this , Skanderbeg decided to open battle with Piccinino 's men . After feeding his men and preparing his horses , Skanderbeg set off by moonlight for the Angevin camp . He found the place empty , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Albanians ' intentions . Skanderbeg then returned to Barletta where he was reinforced by Ferdinand and his men . He then split his army into two , one under Alessandro Sforza 's command , the other under his , and he approached Troia . Jean d'Anjou and Piccinino were stationed in Lucera , however , eight miles from Troia . Knowing that battle would come between Troia and Lucera , Skanderbeg set out by night to capture Seggiano , a mountain lying between the two cities , where he stationed some of his men to protect it . Thence , his men could find refuge in case of defeat . Piccinino had the same objective in mind and set out to capture the mountain , but instead met Skanderbeg 's men . He thus kept his men in order for the coming battle . The next day , the two armies met . The battle lasted until dusk , but Jean 's men suffered a serious defeat and he was forced to flee . Piccinino then retreated from his campaigns . He went northwards where he joined Sigismondo Malatesta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papal state . Skanderbeg 's next task was to recapture Trani , the second most important point in Apulia , aside from Barletta . He succeeded in capturing the commander of the garrison , Fuscia de Foxa , who had rebelled against Ferdinand . Fuscia was outside the walls of Trani with sixteen men when Skanderbeg saw him and surrounded him and then tried to convince him to abandon Orsini , whereby Fuscia refused for pecuniary reasons . On the morning of 28 December 1461 , with Fuscia 's pleas , Gracciani , the vice-commander of the garrison , surrendered Trani . Both Fuscia and Gracciani , however , refused to hand over the garrison 's munitions . Skanderbeg threatened to imprison them if they did not surrender what they were asked to , forcing the two to hand over Trani 's stores . After weeks of marauding , Skanderbeg and his Aragonese colleagues joined Alessandro Sforza 's men . They then yielded all of the fortresses that they had recaptured to Ferdinand . # Aftermath # Seeing that their fortunes were dwindling , Ferdinand 's rivals tried to settle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermediary where Giovanni Orsini and Piccinino offered peace if paid 150,000 and 110,000 ducats respectively , something that Ferdinand refused . This was one of Skanderbeg 's last personal actions in Italy . He stayed in Apulia for another month until January 1462 when he returned to Albania , leaving his soldiers in Italy . His reason for leaving Italy is not clear , but it is believed that at that time Mehmed was preparing his campaign against Hungary , something which could be turned against Albania . On his return route , he again visited Ragusa , where he was likewise welcomed as a hero . He wanted to set off for Albania immediately , but bad weather forced him to stay . He was offered supplies by the Ragusan Rectors , suggesting that he wished to continue to Albania via land , but instead , after ten days in Ragusa , he sailed by ship to Albania . Before leaving , he purchased grain from Sicily for his soldiers in Apulia . The war over the Crown of Naples continued for several more months after Skanderbeg left . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles . In August 1462 , Ferdinand achieved a decisive victory at Orsara . Skanderbeg 's expedition made him famous throughout Italy . In his book , ' ' De Bello Neapolitano ' ' ( ) , Iovianus Pontanus sees the Albanian landing as essential to Ferdinand 's victory : their quick maneuvering and swift assaults virtually immobilized the Italian warriors . Skanderbeg 's expedition succeeded in lifting the Siege of Barletta , capturing Trani through a ruse , forcing the Angevins to turn from an offensive to a defensive strategy , and devastating the land to the point where its inhabitants and Giovanni Orsini were forced to submit to Ferdinand , even allowing Ferdinand to safely attend the wedding of Antonio Piccolomini , Pius II 's nephew . Moreover , the campaign was instrumental in securing the Neapolitan kingdom for Ferdinand . For his services , Ferdinand awarded Monte Sant'Angelo to Skanderbeg where many of his men soon settled . They settled fifteen villages in the rolling landscapes to the east of Taranto . His return to Albania was greeted as a triumph by his followers . Despite the jubilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On 7 July 1462 , the Turkish army resumed its campaigns in Albania . The first major engagement was at Mokra on 7 July 1462 .

On 27 April 1463 , Skanderbeg and Mehmed signed a new peace treaty , but later , on 9 September 1463 , Skanderbeg signed an alliance with Venice which had been preparing for war against the Ottomans . On 12 October 1463 , Pius grew confident enough to declare his crusade against the Ottoman Turks which Skanderbeg joined . 
4 # Summary # A refinery owned by Gulf Oil Corporation in Philadelphia , located at Girard Point on the Schuylkill River in South Philadelphia , caught fire on August 17 , 1975 . This incident resulted in the death of eight firefighters of the Philadelphia Fire Department , injuries to 14 other firefighters , and the loss of a Philadelphia fire apparatus . At the height of this fire , the loss of the huge , sprawling refinery complex was regarded as a real possibility as a tremendous firestorm enveloped two storage tanks , piping , and the refinerys administration building . # Before the fire # The refinery , built in 1905 , occupied 723 acre of land located on the east bank of the Schuylkill River at Penrose Avenue . The Penrose Avenue Bridge ( now the George Platt Memorial Bridge ) connects the east and west sides of the Schuylkill River and passes directly over the refinery . At the time of this fire , the refinery produced 180000 oilbbl per day of refined petroleum products .

On September 9 , 1960 , several storage tanks were struck by lightning at the height of severe thunderstorms and resulted in an eight-alarm fire . On May 16 , 1975 , a six-alarm fire struck the Gulf Refinery . Subsequently , a second six-alarm fire occurred on October 20 , 1975 . At 12:45 a.m. on the morning of Sunday , August 17 , 1975 , the tanker ' ' M/T Afran Neptune ' ' , tied up at a Gulf Refinery dock , began pumping reconstituted Venezulan crude oil ( with an additional 5 percent naphtha ) into Gulf Refinery Tank No. 231 . Tank No. 231 , built in 1929 , of riveted seam construction , had a capacity of 75000 oilbbl and had recently been renovated with an internal floating roof . Within the refinery , the tank was located at Avenue Y and 4th Street .

A brick chimney arose from Boiler House No. 4 and this stack was a familiar sight to westbound motorists on the Penrose Avenue Bridge as the word GULF was painted in large , white letters . # The fire # Hydrocarbon vapors , emanating from Tank 231 , accumulated in the area of the boiler house and were ignited by an unknown ignition source . A flame front followed the vapors back to Tank 231 , causing fire at the tanks vents and an explosion within the outer shell of the stack . These events began to unfold at 5:57 a.m . Shortly thereafter , a second explosion occurred within Tank 231 . Burning petroleum spilled from the tanks vents into a diked area surrounding the tank . Within the diked area , a second tank ( No. 114 ) just north of Tank 231 , containing No. 6 grade fuel oil , also ignited as pipelines within the diked area began to fail . The initial explosion also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petroleum pouring out under pressure ignited . # 2nd alarm # At 6:04 a.m. , upon receiving the report of fire from the Gulf Refinery , the Philadelphia Fire Department transmitted the refinerys fire alarm box : Box 5988 , Penrose and Lanier Avenues . Upon leaving their station , Engine 60 ( the assigned first-due engine company ) could see fire and smoke conditions at a distance , and before arriving at the refinery , Engine 60 ordered the second alarm at 6:09 a.m. # 5th alarm # First arriving companies had large clouds of heavy black smoke emanating from Tank No. 231 , fire on top of Tank No.114 , and fire showing from the 150ft m stack at Boiler House No.4 . The third and fourth alarms were ordered in quick succession by Battalion Chief 1 , Arthur Foley , at 6:11 a.m. and 6:14 am . Acting Assistant Fire Chief Dalmon Edmunds ordered the fifth alarm at 6:34 am . The sixth alarm was ordered by Fire Commissioner Joseph Rizzo at 6:52 am . Over the next several hours , firefighters utilized deluge guns and master streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the burning tanks and piping in an effort to extinguish the fire . By 8:44 a.m. , it appeared that the fire was well contained and the situation sufficiently stabilized to declare the fire under control . Commissioner Rizzo remained on the firegrounds throughout the warm , muggy August day to continue to oversee the fire-fighting operation . Philadelphias two foam pumpers , Engines 160 and 133 , along with the Gulf Refinerys foam pumper , continued to apply foam to the burning tank , piping and manifolds . Additional foam was acquired throughout the day from the fire departments warehouse and the nearby Atlantic-Richfield refinery . It was also obtained from the National Foam Company in West Chester , Pennsylvania . However , as the firefighting operation progressed , it became apparent that the refinerys sewage system was not up to the task of properly draining the foam , water and petroleum-naphtha product mixture that was accumulating on the ground along Avenue Y , between 4th Street and 5th Street to the east , running in front of the refinerys administration building . These drainage problems were further exacerbated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps . These pumps were shut off as part of a decision to de-energize overhead power lines that ran adjacent to Tank 231 along 4th Street . As the liquid mixture continued to build up in Avenue Y , Engines 16 and 40 were sent to Avenue Y and 5th Street to draft from a sewer intake and pump the material to a diked area some distance away . # Additional Ignition # Engine 133 was set up on the east side of Tank No. 231 at Avenue Y at 4th Street , applying foam to the tank . Three members were attending to the apparatus and wading in the foam-water-petroleum mixture which was accumulating on the ground . Commissioner Rizzo and Gulf Refinery manager Jack Burk were on an overhead catwalk nearby observing the fire-fighting operation . Without warning , and in full view of Commissioner Rizzo and Burk , the accumulating liquid surrounding Engine 133 ignited , immediately trapping the three firefighters working at Engine 133 . Instinctively and without hesitation , other nearby firefighters dove into the burning liquid to rescue their comrades , not aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the advancing fire . # 9th alarm # It was now 4:41 p.m. and a firestorm was developing as the fire quickly spread eastward along Avenue Y towards 5th Street . Viewing the unfolding horror before him , Commissioner Rizzo ordered two more alarms , five additional rescue squads , and the recall of all companies which had previously been released from the firegrounds throughout the day . On these orders , the fire alarm room transmitted the seventh and eighth alarms . As the fire had been placed under control nearly eight hours earlier , firefighters in stations across the city knew that the unthinkable had occurred as these additional alarms were struck . At 4:46 p.m. , Commissioner Rizzo ordered the ninth alarm and notification of Philadelphia Managing Director Hillel Levinson as a major disaster was now unfolding at the Gulf Refinery . As the fire swept eastward along 5th Street , Philadelphias foam pumpers , Engines 160 and 133 , and the Gulf Refinery foam pumper were destroyed in the fires advance .

Upon reaching 5th Street , the fire traveled two city blocks north along 5th Street , threatening four additional storage tanks and the 125ft m Penrose Avenue Bridge . # 10th alarm # At 5:37 p.m. , Commissioner Rizzo ordered the tenth alarm as the fire was then traveling southward and engulfing the refinerys administration building , which was located on the south side of Avenue Y between 4th and 5th Streets . The tenth alarm companies were ordered to report to Gate 24 at Penrose and Lanier Avenues , to set up deluge guns and leave the area . As the tenth alarm was being requested , a box alarm was being transmitted for a fire in a paper warehouse 15 mi away at F Street and Erie Avenue . Upon arrival , Chief Edward Hampson , Battalion Chief 10 , had heavy fire in a three-story , former printing company now being used for paper storage .

By seven oclock , the involved tanks and pipelines were gushing flames and nearby streets in the complex were burning streams of oil and other petroleum products . For a period of time , it was far from certain where the fire would be stopped . Burk was quoted as saying that contingency plans had been made for a retreat through the refinery , street by street , tank by tank . But far from retreating , the men of the Philadelphia Fire Department attacked , retaking 5th Street , 4th Street , and finally Avenue Y. At 1:00 a.m. , Commissioner Rizzo left the firegrounds , relinquishing command to Deputy Fire Commissioner Harry T.

By Monday morning , the true cost of this disaster became apparent . Six firefighters were killed and two were severely burned in the flare-up that occurred on Sunday afternoon . The six firefighters were : * Firefighter John Andrews , Age 49 , Engine 49 * Firefighter Joseph Wiley , Age 33 , Ladder 27 * Firefighter Roger Parker , Age 28 , Ladder 27 * Firefighter Hugh McIntyre , Age 53 , Engine 56 * Firefighter Robert Fisher , Age 43 , Engine 33 * Firefighter Ralph Campana , Age 41 , Ladder 19 Fire Lieutenant James Pouliot , age 35 , Engine 20 , died of his burns on August 24 , 1975 and Firefighter Carroll Brenek , age 33 , of Engine 57 , died of his burns on August 30 , 1975 .

While no crude oil escaped from the tank as a result of being overfilled , large quantities of hydrocarbon vapors were trapped above the surface of the tanks crude oil . As the quantity of crude oil increased , these hydrocarbon vapors were forced out of the tanks vents and into the area of the No. 4 Boiler House where the initial flash occurred . The overfilling of the tank , in turn , resulted from a failure of the tankers personnel to properly monitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At approximately 6:02 a.m. in the wake of the first explosions and fire , the tanker terminated its pumping operations , left its Schuylkill River berth and relocated to the Gulf piers at Hog Island . In August 2007 , about 200 people gathered at the Firemans Hall Museum in Philadelphia as plaques were unveiled to honor the firefighters lost in the refinery disaster . The refinery has since been acquired by Sunoco.
